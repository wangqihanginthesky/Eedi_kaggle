0,Does not know that angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware of or have not fully understood the fundamental property of triangles that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees. They may believe that the sum of the angles can be any value or may think that it varies depending on the type of triangle (e.g., equilateral, isosceles, scalene). 

This misconception can lead to errors when students are asked to find missing angles in a triangle, determine if a set of angles can form a triangle, or solve problems involving the interior angles of triangles.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When given two angles of a triangle and asked to find the third angle, a student with this misconception may not know how to proceed or may give an incorrect answer.
2. When asked to determine if a set of three angles (e.g., 60°, 80°, 100°) can form a triangle, a student with this misconception may incorrectly say yes or no without considering the sum of the angles.
3. When solving a problem involving the interior angles of a triangle, such as finding the sum of the angles in a triangle with two given angles, a student with this misconception may arrive at an incorrect solution."
1,Uses dividing fractions method for multiplying fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students incorrectly apply the method for dividing fractions to multiplication problems involving fractions. In their minds, they may think that since dividing fractions involves inverting the second fraction and then multiplying, the same operation of inverting might apply to multiplying fractions as well. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of fraction operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying two simple fractions: When asked to multiply 1/2 and 1/3, a student with this misconception may incorrectly invert the second fraction and multiply, resulting in an incorrect calculation of 1/2 ÷ 1/3 = 1/2 * 3/1 = 3/2, instead of the correct 1/6.

- Multiplying fractions with variables: In algebra, when dealing with expressions like (1/2)x * (1/3), students with this misconception may again invert the second fraction, leading to incorrect simplifications.

- Word problems involving fraction multiplication: In real-world applications, such as calculating the area of a room that is 1/2 of a certain length and 1/3 of a certain width, students might apply the incorrect dividing fractions method, resulting in incorrect area calculations."
2,Believes there are 100 degrees in a full turn,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a full turn or a full circle consists of 100 degrees, rather than the correct 360 degrees. This error can stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of degrees as a unit of measurement for angles, or a lack of exposure to real-world examples that illustrate the concept of a full turn.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When drawing or measuring angles in geometry, a student might label a full turn as 100 degrees.
- In a real-world context, a student might believe that a car turning a full circle has only turned 100 degrees.
- When working with circular shapes in art or design, a student might divide the circle into 100 equal parts, rather than 360.
- In problem-solving, a student might calculate the measure of an angle in a diagram incorrectly, assuming a full turn has 100 degrees."
3,"Thinks a quadratic without a non variable term, can not be factorised","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to quadratic equations and factorization. They may believe that a quadratic expression in the form of ax^2 + bx, where 'c' is absent (i.e., the constant term is zero), cannot be factorized. They may think that factorization requires a non-variable term (the constant 'c') to be present in the quadratic expression.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Factorizing x^2 + 5x
* Factorizing 2x^2 - 3x
* Factorizing x^2 - 2x

In each of these cases, the student may mistakenly think that factorization is not possible because there is no constant term present in the quadratic expression."
4,Believes addition of terms and powers of terms are equivalent e.g. a + c = a^c,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of addition and exponentiation. They may think that adding two terms or variables together is the same as raising one term to the power of the other. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental operations in mathematics, specifically the difference between addition and exponentiation.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, students may incorrectly simplify a + b as a^b instead of leaving it as a + b.
- When solving equations, students may mistakenly apply the rules of exponents to addition problems, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with polynomials, students may incorrectly combine terms by adding their exponents instead of their coefficients.
- When solving problems involving geometric progression, students may incorrectly calculate the sum of terms by adding their exponents instead of using the correct formula.
- When solving mathematical problems in science, students may misapply the rules of exponents to real-world problems, leading to incorrect conclusions."
5,"When measuring a reflex angle, gives the acute or obtuse angle that sums to 360 instead","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to measure reflex angles. Instead of identifying the actual reflex angle, they tend to find the acute or obtuse angle on the other side of the line or the interior angle of the shape, which, when added to the reflex angle, would sum to 360 degrees. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the definition of reflex angles or a failure to recognize that reflex angles are greater than 180 degrees.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When measuring the angle between two intersecting lines or planes, students might measure the acute angle formed instead of the reflex angle.
- In a polygon, students may find the interior angle of the shape instead of the reflex angle formed by extending one of the sides.
- When working with angles around a point, students might find the acute or obtuse angle on the other side of the point instead of the reflex angle.
- In circle theorems, students might incorrectly measure the angle subtended by an arc, giving the acute angle on the other side of the circle instead of the reflex angle."
6,Can identify the multiplier used to form an equivalent fraction but does not apply to the numerator,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand that to form an equivalent fraction, a multiplier is applied to the denominator, but they fail to apply the same multiplier to the numerator. They may recognize the need to multiply the denominator by a certain number to obtain an equivalent fraction, but they do not realize that the numerator must also be multiplied by the same number to maintain the equivalence of the fractions.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When simplifying fractions: A student may simplify the fraction 6/8 to 3/4 by dividing the denominator by 2, but fail to divide the numerator by 2 as well.
* When comparing fractions: A student may compare the fractions 2/4 and 3/6 by multiplying the denominator of 2/4 by 1.5 to get 3/6, but fail to multiply the numerator by 1.5 as well.
* When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators: A student may multiply the denominator of one fraction to match the denominator of the other fraction, but fail to multiply the numerator by the same number.
* When solving problems involving equivalent ratios: A student may recognize the need to multiply the denominator of a ratio by a certain number to obtain an equivalent ratio, but fail to multiply the numerator by the same number."
7,Believes gradient = change in y,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand that the gradient is related to the change in the y-coordinate, but they fail to consider the change in the x-coordinate. They might believe that the gradient is solely the change in the y-coordinate, rather than the ratio of the change in the y-coordinate to the change in the x-coordinate. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate gradients, especially when the change in the x-coordinate is not equal to 1.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When finding the gradient of a line that passes through two points, students might only consider the difference in the y-coordinates, ignoring the difference in the x-coordinates.
* When comparing the steepness of two lines, students might incorrectly conclude that the line with the greater change in y has a greater gradient, without considering the corresponding changes in x.
* When interpreting the gradient in a real-world context, such as the slope of a hill or the rate of change of a quantity, students might misunderstand the meaning of the gradient and focus solely on the change in the y-coordinate."
8,Student thinks that any two angles along a straight line are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of angles on a straight line. They might recall that the sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees, but incorrectly assume that this means any two angles on that line are equal. They may think that the mere fact that two angles share the same line means they must have the same measure, disregarding the possibility of one angle being larger and the other smaller, as long as they add up to 180 degrees.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing diagrams, a student might label two angles on the same line with the same value, even if there's no evidence to support that they are equal.
- When solving problems, a student might incorrectly assume that two angles on a straight line are equal, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.
- When dealing with more complex geometric shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, students might apply this misconception to internal angles, thinking that any two angles along a straight line within the shape are equal, which can lead to incorrect analysis of the shape's properties."
9,Thinks there are 180 degrees in a full turn,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a full turn or a full rotation is equivalent to 180 degrees. They may think that since 180 degrees is a straight line, when you turn around completely, you would have covered this amount of degrees. However, this misunderstanding neglects the fact that a full turn actually involves turning all the way around until you face the same direction as you started with.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When measuring angles in shapes and students assume that a full turn around the shape is 180 degrees.
- When working with directions on a compass and students think that turning around completely would be 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving rotational symmetry, and students assume that an object has made a full turn after 180 degrees.
- When determining the angle of rotation in a geometric transformation and students think that a full rotation is equivalent to 180 degrees."
10,"Believes duration can be read from a timetable, rather than calculating from start and end times","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that a timetable directly displays the duration of an event or a journey, rather than understanding that the duration needs to be calculated by subtracting the start time from the end time. They may focus solely on the start and end times listed on the timetable without realizing the need to perform a calculation to determine the length of time.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading a bus or train schedule, a student might think the duration of the journey is explicitly stated, rather than calculating it from the departure and arrival times.
- In a school setting, a student might look at a class timetable and incorrectly assume that the duration of a class is directly shown, rather than calculating it from the start and end times of the class period.
- When planning a trip or scheduling appointments, a student might misinterpret a timetable or calendar, thinking that the duration of events or travel times are directly displayed, rather than requiring a calculation."
11,"When reading value from graph, reads from the wrong axes.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to correctly identify or interpret the x and y axes on a graph, leading to incorrect readings of values. They may confuse the variables being represented on each axis or misunderstand the scale and units used, resulting in misinterpretation of the data. This can happen when students are not familiar with the graph's layout, are not paying attention to the axis labels, or are not understanding the relationship between the variables being graphed.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to find the value of a variable at a specific point on the graph, but they look at the wrong axis to determine the value.
- When a student is comparing data from two different graphs, but the axes are labeled differently, leading to confusion.
- When a student is reading values from a graph with multiple lines or curves, but they are not paying attention to which line or curve corresponds to which variable.
- When a student is working with a graph that has a non-standard or non-linear scale, making it harder to read values accurately.
- When a student is interpreting a graph with a lot of data or complex information, leading to information overload and incorrect readings."
12,Thinks that the side view does not include the furthest rows back,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to visualize and draw 3D objects, such as a seating arrangement in a theater or a stadium, from different perspectives. They may believe that when drawing a side view, only the rows that are closest to the viewer should be included, and the rows further back are not visible. This can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate representation of the 3D object.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Drawing a side view of a theater with multiple rows of seats, the student only includes the front rows.
* Illustrating a stadium's seating arrangement from the side, the student forgets to include the upper levels of seating.
* Creating a side view of a rectangular prism, such as a bookshelf, the student only draws the front section and neglects to include the sections further back.
* When asked to draw a side view of a 3D object, such as a building or a bridge, the student only includes the parts that are closest to the viewer."
13,"Does not subtract from the hours, when having to borrow for a time calculation","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are performing time calculations that involve borrowing, but they fail to subtract from the hours when necessary. For example, when subtracting 2 hours and 45 minutes from 5 hours and 30 minutes, some students might correctly borrow 60 minutes from the hours to make the minutes calculation easier, but they forget to reduce the hours accordingly.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting 3 hours and 15 minutes from 8 hours and 5 minutes
- Finding the difference between 9 hours and 45 minutes and 6 hours and 20 minutes
- Calculating the time difference between 10 hours and 50 minutes and 7 hours and 35 minutes
- Subtracting 2 hours and 55 minutes from 11 hours and 20 minutes
- Finding the difference between 4 hours and 10 minutes and 1 hour and 55 minutes"
14,Does not understand how to create a multiple of an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to grasp the concept of creating a multiple of an equation, which involves multiplying both sides of the equation by the same non-zero value. They may not understand that this operation maintains the equation's balance and does not alter its solution. 

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Incorrectly multiplying only one side of the equation by a value.
- Failing to recognize that multiplying both sides by the same value preserves the equation's equality.
- Not understanding that different multiples of the same equation can have different coefficients but still represent the same relationship.

Some short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Case: Multiplying an equation by a coefficient to eliminate a fraction, but only multiplying one side of the equation.

Example: 1/2x = 3, attempting to multiply only the left side by 2 to get x = 3, instead of multiplying both sides to get x = 6.

2. Case: Creating equivalent equations to solve a system of linear equations, but failing to multiply both sides of the equation by the same value.

Example: 2x + 3y = 5 and x + 2y = 3, attempting to multiply only the first equation by 2 to get 4x + 6y = 10, without realizing the need to multiply the second equation by a corresponding value.

3. Case: Simplifying an equation by multiplying both sides by a greatest common divisor (GCD), but not recognizing that this operation maintains the equation's solution.

Example: 4x = 12, attempting to divide both sides by 2 to get 2x = 6, but not realizing that multiplying both sides by 1/2 would achieve the same result."
15,"Confuses the order of operations, believes addition comes before division","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully familiar with the order of operations rule, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). They incorrectly assume that operations should be performed in a different order, in this case, believing that addition should be performed before division.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly evaluate mathematical expressions. For example:

Case 1: Evaluating the expression 12 ÷ 3 + 2, a student with this misconception may first add 3 and 2 to get 5, then divide 12 by 5, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2.4.

Case 2: Evaluating the expression 8 + 4 ÷ 2, a student with this misconception may first add 8 and 4 to get 12, then divide 12 by 2, resulting in an incorrect answer of 6.

Case 3: Evaluating the expression 9 ÷ 3 + 1, a student with this misconception may first add 3 and 1 to get 4, then divide 9 by 4, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2.25."
16,Believes that graphs of inverse proportion meet the axes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of inverse proportionality and its graphical representation. Inverse proportionality implies that as one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa, often represented by the equation y = k/x, where k is a constant. The misconception here is that students think the graph of an inverse proportion will intersect with the x-axis and y-axis at specific points. However, the graph of an inverse proportion actually approaches the axes asymptotically, meaning it gets arbitrarily close but never touches the axes.

Cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Graphing the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas: Students may incorrectly draw the graph intersecting the axes, failing to recognize that as pressure approaches zero, volume approaches infinity, and vice versa.

2. Analyzing the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task: Students may mistakenly plot the graph crossing the axes, not understanding that as the number of workers increases, the time taken approaches zero but never actually reaches it.

3. Exploring the relationship between the distance from a light source and the intensity of the light: Students may incorrectly assume that the graph will meet the axes at specific points, failing to recognize that as distance increases, intensity approaches zero but never actually reaches it."
17,Confuses AM and PM when calculating time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between AM (Ante Meridiem, meaning before midday) and PM (Post Meridiem, meaning after midday) when working with time. They may incorrectly assume that AM refers to any time in the morning and evening, while PM refers to the afternoon, or vice versa. This misunderstanding can lead to errors when calculating time intervals, scheduling events, or solving time-related problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the duration between two times, such as 9 AM to 3 PM, students might mistakenly think it's 6 hours in the morning.
- When converting 12-hour clock times to 24-hour clock times, students might incorrectly change AM to PM or vice versa, e.g., 3 PM becomes 3 AM instead of 15:00 hours.
- When solving word problems involving time, such as ""Tom has a meeting at 8 AM and another at 2 PM,"" students may confuse the AM and PM designations and schedule the meetings incorrectly.
- When reading analog clocks, students might misinterpret the AM/PM indicator, thinking that a time like 9:00 is in the evening (PM) instead of the morning (AM)."
18,"Given the length of the sides, still does not recognise there is enough information to find the area","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given the lengths of the sides of a shape, but they fail to recognize that they have sufficient information to calculate the area. This can occur when students are not familiar with the formulas for finding the area of different shapes or when they are not confident in applying these formulas. 

For example, if students are given the lengths of the base and height of a triangle, they may not realize that they can use the formula ""Area = 0.5 x base x height"" to find the area. Similarly, if they are given the lengths of the sides of a rectangle, they may not recognize that they can use the formula ""Area = length x width"" to find the area.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When finding the area of a triangle given the lengths of its base and height.
- When finding the area of a rectangle given the lengths of its length and width.
- When finding the area of a parallelogram given the lengths of its base and height.
- When finding the area of a trapezoid given the lengths of its parallel sides and height."
19,"When multiplying a surd by an integer, adds the integer to the number under the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the properties of surds and multiplication. They incorrectly believe that when multiplying a surd by an integer, they should add the integer to the number under the radical sign, rather than multiplying the number under the radical sign by the integer squared. 

For example, when given the expression 3 * √5, students with this misconception might write the result as √(5 + 3) = √8, or even √(5 * 3) = √15, but with the wrong reasoning. Similarly, when given the expression 2 * √3, they might write the result as √(3 + 2) = √5.

This misconception can also occur when dealing with more complex expressions, such as 2 * √(3 + 4) or (3 + 2) * √5, where the student's misunderstanding of the multiplication rule can lead to more intricate and incorrect calculations."
20,Believes the number of wholes in a mixed number multiplies by the fraction part,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of mixed numbers. A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a fraction. Students with this misconception believe that when you have a mixed number, the whole number part multiplies the fraction part. For example, they might think that 2 1/2 is equal to 2 x 1/2 = 2/2 + 2/2 = 4/2 = 2, or even 2 x 1/2 = 1, which is not the correct interpretation of the mixed number. They fail to understand that the whole number part and the fraction part are separate components that are added together.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions: A student might think that 3 1/4 is equal to 3 x 1/4 instead of 3 + 1/4.
- When adding or subtracting mixed numbers: A student might think that 2 1/2 + 1 1/2 is equal to (2 x 1/2) + (1 x 1/2) instead of 2 + 1/2 + 1 + 1/2.
- When multiplying or dividing mixed numbers: A student might think that 2 1/2 x 3 is equal to (2 x 1/2) x 3 instead of (2 + 1/2) x 3.
- When solving real-world problems involving mixed numbers: A student might think that if they have 2 1/2 bags of flour, and each bag contains 5 kg of flour, they have (2 x 1/2) x 5 kg instead of 2 x 5 + 1/2 x 5 kg."
21,Estimates shares of a ratio instead of calculating,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with ratios and proportions, particularly when they are required to find a missing value or compare different parts of a ratio. Instead of performing the necessary calculations, students tend to estimate or guess the shares of a ratio based on intuition or rough mental calculations. 

For instance, when given a ratio of 3:5 and asked to find the value of one part if the total is 24, a student with this misconception might estimate that the first part is approximately 9 (because 3 is roughly a third of 3+5=8 and a third of 24 is 8) and the second part is around 15, rather than performing the actual calculation to find the correct values (which would be 9 and 15, but through accurate calculation: 3/8 * 24 = 9, 5/8 * 24 = 15).

This misconception can lead to inaccurate answers and a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur include:

- Sharing a certain number of items in a given ratio.
- Finding missing values in a proportion or ratio problem.
- Comparing the sizes of different parts of a ratio.
- Scaling up or down a ratio to find equivalent ratios.
- Real-world applications, such as dividing a certain quantity of resources or costs in a given ratio."
22,Confuses the ten thousands and thousands place value columns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the ten thousands and thousands place value columns in a multi-digit number. They may incorrectly identify or place digits in these columns, leading to errors in reading, writing, and manipulating large numbers. For example, a student might mistake the digit in the ten thousands place for the thousands place, or vice versa.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When reading a five-digit number: A student might read 54,321 as fifty-three thousand two hundred and twenty-one, rather than fifty-four thousand three hundred and twenty-one.

2. When writing a number in standard form: A student may incorrectly write 45,678 as 4,5678 or 456,78, confusing the ten thousands and thousands place.

3. When comparing multi-digit numbers: Students might incorrectly compare numbers, thinking that 54,321 is less than 53,456 because they are focusing on the wrong place value column.

4. When performing arithmetic operations: This misconception can lead to errors when performing calculations, such as addition and subtraction, with multi-digit numbers."
23,Does not understand the command word 'difference',"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students interpret the command word 'difference' as asking for any operation (addition, subtraction, etc.) rather than realizing it specifically requires a subtraction operation to find the amount by which two values are not the same. Students may misunderstand 'difference' to mean any type of mathematical relationship or comparison, such as adding or multiplying numbers, instead of understanding it as a specific instruction to find the result of subtracting one value from another.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A question asks for the difference between 10 and 5. Students with this misconception might add 10 and 5, resulting in 15, instead of subtracting 5 from 10, resulting in 5.
- Case 2: A problem states that a person has 15 pencils and another person has 8 pencils, asking for the difference in the number of pencils they have. Students with this misconception might multiply 15 by 8 or add the numbers, instead of subtracting 8 from 15 to find the difference.
- Case 3: A data analysis question asks for the difference in the heights of two students. Students with this misconception might calculate the sum of the heights or use another operation instead of subtracting the smaller height from the larger height."
24,Does not understand the term multiple,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not comprehend the concept of a multiple, which is a product of a given number and an integer. Students may struggle to understand that multiples are the result of multiplying a number by a whole number, and that every number has an infinite number of multiples. They may also confuse multiples with factors or other mathematical concepts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to list the multiples of a given number, students may only list a few numbers without understanding the pattern or relationship between the numbers.
- When solving multiplication problems, students may not recognize that the product is a multiple of one of the factors.
- When working with real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, students may not understand that the quantities needed are multiples of a base unit (e.g., 2 x 250g of flour).
- When exploring number patterns, students may not recognize that a sequence of numbers is formed by multiples of a given number.
- When solving word problems, students may misinterpret the term ""multiple"" and think it means ""many"" or ""a lot"" rather than a specific mathematical relationship."
25,Does not realise that when you multiply by 0 the answer will always be 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental property of multiplication with zero. They might think that multiplying a number by 0 will result in the number itself or a different value, rather than understanding that any number multiplied by 0 always equals 0. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of exposure to the concept or an incomplete grasp of the multiplication facts.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When multiplying a large number by 0: A student might think that 100 × 0 = 100, rather than 0.
2. When multiplying a decimal by 0: A student might think that 0.5 × 0 = 0.5, rather than 0.
3. When multiplying a fraction by 0: A student might think that 1/2 × 0 = 1/2, rather than 0.
4. In word problems involving real-life scenarios: A student might think that if you have 5 groups of 0 pencils, you have 5 pencils, rather than 0 pencils.
5. In algebraic expressions: A student might simplify an expression like 2x × 0 as 2x, rather than 0."
26,Thinks x = ? or y = ? is y = x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that when they are given an equation with variables on both sides, such as x = ? or y = ?, the solution is simply the other variable. They incorrectly assume that the equation is asking for a direct equivalence between the two variables, rather than understanding that the equation is a statement of equality between two expressions.

This misconception can lead students to overlook the actual relationship between the variables and the operations being performed on them, and instead, simply swap the variables. For example, if given the equation 2x = y, a student with this misconception might write y = x, ignoring the coefficient 2.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When solving linear equations, such as 2x = y or x + 3 = y.
* When working with algebraic expressions, such as simplifying 2x + 5 = y.
* When graphing linear equations, such as y = 2x, and mistakenly assuming the graph is a simple 1:1 correspondence between x and y."
27,Believes squaring a fraction requires you to double both parts,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of squaring a fraction. They incorrectly believe that to square a fraction, they need to multiply both the numerator and denominator by 2, rather than multiplying the fraction by itself. For example, when squaring the fraction 1/2, they would incorrectly think the result is 2/4, rather than the correct result of (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as (1/2)^2.
- When working with ratios and proportions, such as scaling a recipe up or down by a fractional factor.
- When solving geometric problems, such as finding the area of a rectangle with fractional dimensions.
- When calculating probabilities, such as finding the probability of two independent events both occurring, where each event has a fractional probability."
28,Thinks the interior angles of any polygon add up to 360,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the property of a specific type of polygon, such as a quadrilateral, where the sum of the interior angles is indeed 360 degrees. They may incorrectly assume that this property applies to all polygons, regardless of the number of sides. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when dealing with polygons that have more or fewer sides.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to find the sum of interior angles of a hexagon (6-sided polygon), the student may incorrectly answer 360 degrees.
- When calculating the missing angle in a pentagon (5-sided polygon), the student may assume the sum of the interior angles is 360 degrees, resulting in an incorrect solution.
- When comparing the sum of interior angles of different polygons, the student may incorrectly conclude that they are all equal to 360 degrees, missing the relationship between the number of sides and the sum of the interior angles."
29,Forgot to simplify the fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to simplify a fraction to its lowest terms. Simplifying a fraction means dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) to get the simplest form of the fraction. When students forget to simplify fractions, they may end up with equivalent fractions that appear different, leading to incorrect comparisons or calculations.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When adding or subtracting fractions with common denominators, students may not simplify the resulting fraction.
- When multiplying or dividing fractions, students may not simplify the product or quotient.
- When converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, students may not simplify the fraction part.
- When comparing fractions, students may not simplify fractions to determine which one is larger or smaller.
- When solving algebraic equations involving fractions, students may not simplify the fraction solutions."
30,"When asked for a number n times smaller or bigger, subtracts or adds n","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of ""n times smaller or bigger"" as an absolute value to be added or subtracted. They tend to think that making something 'n times smaller' means subtracting 'n' from the original value, and making something 'n times bigger' means adding 'n' to the original value. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of proportional relationships and multiplicative reasoning.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A book costs $15. If it costs 3 times more, a student might answer $18 instead of $45.
- A toy car track is 12 meters long. If it's 4 times longer, a student might answer 16 meters instead of 48 meters.
- A water tank can hold 8 liters of water. If a new tank can hold 5 times less water, a student might answer 3 liters instead of 1.6 liters."
31,Does not understand bar modelling in algebra,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to visualize and apply the concept of bar modelling in algebra, which is a method used to represent and solve problems using bars or blocks to represent unknowns or variables. Students may have difficulty in understanding how to set up the model, identify the variables, and manipulate the bars to solve the equation. They may also confuse the concept of bar modelling with other algebraic methods, such as solving equations using inverse operations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are introduced to bar modelling for the first time and are unsure of how to apply it to different types of problems.
- When students are given complex problems that involve multiple variables or operations, and they struggle to represent these using the bar model.
- When students are asked to use bar modelling to solve word problems, and they have difficulty in translating the problem into a visual representation.
- When students are required to use bar modelling to solve equations with negative numbers or decimals, and they are unsure of how to represent these using the bar model.
- When students are given a problem that involves a combination of bar modelling and other algebraic methods, and they struggle to integrate these different approaches."
32,"When squaring a variable, believes they also need to square the coefficient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with algebraic expressions involving variables and coefficients. They mistakenly believe that when squaring a term that includes both a coefficient and a variable, they need to square both the coefficient and the variable separately. For example, when squaring the term 3x, they might think that the result is (3^2)(x^2) = 9x^2, rather than understanding that only the variable (x) should be squared, while the coefficient (3) is simply multiplied by itself as a result of the squaring operation.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Squaring 2x: Students may write (2^2)(x^2) = 4x^2 instead of (2x)^2 = 4x^2.
- Squaring 5y: Students may write (5^2)(y^2) = 25y^2 instead of (5y)^2 = 25y^2.
- Squaring -4z: Students may write ((-4)^2)(z^2) = 16z^2 instead of (-4z)^2 = 16z^2.
- Squaring 3(2x): Students may write (3^2)((2x)^2) = 9(4x^2) = 36x^2 instead of (3(2x))^2 = (6x)^2 = 36x^2."
33,Uses more than 3 letters to describe an angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that an angle can be described using more than three letters. In geometry, an angle is typically denoted by three letters, with the middle letter representing the vertex of the angle. Students may think that using more letters would provide more information or clarify the angle's position, but this is not the case. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are labeling angles in a complex diagram with multiple intersecting lines and try to include all the points that the angle's arms pass through.
- When students are describing an angle in a 3D shape and attempt to include all the vertices of the shape that are related to the angle.
- When students are comparing two or more angles and mistakenly believe that using more letters will help to differentiate between them."
34,Believes dividing a negative by a positive gives a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to division operations involving negative numbers. They might intuitively think that dividing a negative number by a positive number would 'cancel out' the negativity and result in a positive answer. They may apply the rule for multiplying and dividing positive numbers to negative numbers without understanding the rules for signs when dividing negative numbers by positive numbers.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a negative integer by a positive integer, e.g., -4 ÷ 2
- When dividing a negative fraction by a positive fraction, e.g., -1/2 ÷ 1/3
- When solving algebraic equations involving division with negative and positive coefficients, e.g., -x ÷ 2 = 3
- When working with word problems involving negative temperatures, finances, or other real-world applications that involve division with negative and positive numbers."
35,Believes you add 2 instead of subtracting 2 to the numbers of sides when finding total interior angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to calculate the total interior angles of polygons, specifically using the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n represents the number of sides of the polygon. The misconception involves adding 2 to the number of sides instead of subtracting 2, which would result in an incorrect formula of (n+2) * 180 degrees.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the total interior angles of simple polygons such as triangles or quadrilaterals, students might mistakenly apply the incorrect formula and calculate (3+2) * 180 or (4+2) * 180.
- In problems involving the comparison of interior angles between different polygons, students with this misconception might incorrectly conclude that a polygon with more sides has a greater total interior angle than it actually does.
- When working with more complex polygon problems, such as calculating the total interior angles of polygons with many sides, students might repeatedly apply the incorrect formula, leading to significantly incorrect results."
36,Enlarges by the wrong centre of enlargement,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly identify the centre of enlargement when enlarging a shape. In geometry, the centre of enlargement is a fixed point from which the enlargement is performed, and the distances from this point to the corresponding points on the original and enlarged shapes are in the same ratio as the scale factor. However, students may mistakenly choose a different point as the centre of enlargement, such as a vertex or the midpoint of a side, leading to incorrect enlargements.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When enlarging a shape by a scale factor of 2, a student may choose the midpoint of a side as the centre of enlargement instead of the actual centre.
- When enlarging a triangle, a student may choose a vertex as the centre of enlargement, resulting in an uneven and distorted enlarged shape.
- When enlarging a circle, a student may choose a point on the circumference as the centre of enlargement instead of the actual centre of the circle.
- When solving a problem involving the enlargement of a 2D shape, a student may ignore the given centre of enlargement and use a different point, leading to incorrect answers."
37,Rounded to wrong degree of accuracy (2sf not 1sf),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round a number to a specific degree of accuracy, such as 1 significant figure (1sf), but they mistakenly round it to 2 significant figures (2sf) instead. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the rules for rounding numbers or simply a careless error.

For example, if a student is asked to round the number 43.72 to 1sf, they may incorrectly round it to 44.0 (2sf) instead of the correct answer, 40 (1sf).

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Calculating the perimeter or area of a shape, where the answer needs to be rounded to a specific degree of accuracy.
- Measuring the length or mass of an object, where the measurement needs to be rounded to a specific degree of accuracy.
- Solving mathematical problems involving decimals, where the answer needs to be rounded to a specific degree of accuracy.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student measures the length of a room to be 12.75 meters and is asked to round it to 1sf. They incorrectly round it to 12.8 meters (2sf) instead of 10 meters (1sf).
- Case 2: A student calculates the area of a circle to be 45.62 square meters and is asked to round it to 1sf. They incorrectly round it to 45.6 square meters (2sf) instead of 50 square meters (1sf).
- Case 3: A student measures the mass of an object to be 9.45 kilograms and is asked to round it to 1sf. They incorrectly round it to 9.5 kilograms (2sf) instead of 10 kilograms (1sf)."
38,Believes the sides of an inequality can be switched without changing the direction of the sign,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can switch the left and right sides of an inequality without reversing the direction of the inequality sign. They might think that if a > b, then b > a is also true, which is incorrect. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of inequalities and the relationships between the values on either side of the inequality sign.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When solving linear inequalities, students may switch the sides of the inequality without changing the direction of the sign. For example, if they start with 2x > 5, they might incorrectly rewrite it as 5 > 2x without flipping the inequality sign.

- When comparing the sizes of two quantities, students might mistakenly switch the order of the quantities without reversing the inequality sign. For instance, if they know that 3 > 2, they might incorrectly write 2 > 3.

- When working with word problems that involve inequalities, students may misinterpret the situation and switch the sides of the inequality without changing the direction of the sign. For example, if a problem states that ""Tom has more than 5 pencils,"" students might incorrectly write the inequality as 5 > number of pencils Tom has."
39,Multiplies by 1000 instead of 100 when converting a decimal to a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting a decimal to a percentage. They understand that to convert a decimal to a percentage, a multiplication operation is required. However, they mistakenly believe that they need to multiply the decimal by 1000 instead of 100. This results in the student obtaining a value that is 10 times larger than the actual percentage.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 0.5 to a percentage: A student may multiply 0.5 by 1000 and obtain 500% instead of the correct answer of 50%.
- Converting 0.25 to a percentage: A student may multiply 0.25 by 1000 and obtain 250% instead of the correct answer of 25%.
- Converting 0.75 to a percentage: A student may multiply 0.75 by 1000 and obtain 750% instead of the correct answer of 75%."
40,Believes midpoint multiplied by frequency is equivalent to frequency density,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of frequency density in histograms and confuse it with the midpoint of a class interval multiplied by the frequency. They may believe that by simply multiplying the midpoint of a class interval by the number of data points within that interval (frequency), they are calculating the frequency density. However, this approach neglects the width of the class interval, which is a crucial factor in determining the frequency density.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When constructing histograms and calculating the area of the bars, students may use the midpoint multiplied by the frequency instead of the correct formula, leading to incorrect interpretations of the data.
- In problems where students are asked to compare the distribution of two datasets, they may incorrectly calculate the frequency density, resulting in flawed conclusions.
- When analyzing real-life data, such as exam scores or population distributions, students may apply this misconception, leading to inaccurate representations of the data and incorrect inferences."
41,Believes the mean is the number of categories given divided by something,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the mean in data and statistics. They incorrectly assume that the mean is calculated by dividing the number of categories or the total number of things being counted by some other number, rather than understanding that the mean is actually the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the average score of a set of exam results and they divide the number of students by the number of subjects instead of adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of students.
- When students are given a set of categorical data, such as favorite colors, and they try to find the mean by dividing the number of colors by the number of students, instead of recognizing that the mean is not applicable in this case.
- When students are asked to find the mean of a set of data that includes multiple categories with frequencies, and they divide the number of categories by the total frequency instead of multiplying each category by its frequency, adding up the results, and then dividing by the total frequency."
42,Believes that the complement of a set includes any elements which are also in another set.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of set complement. The complement of a set is actually the set of elements that are not in the original set, but are in the universal set. However, students with this misconception think that the complement includes elements that are not only in the universal set, but also in another specific set.

For example, if we have sets A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {3, 4, 5}, and the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, students with this misconception might believe that the complement of A (denoted as A') includes elements that are in B, so A' = {3, 4, 5}. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the complement of a set in a Venn diagram with multiple overlapping sets.
- When solving problems involving set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference.
- When working with real-world applications of set theory, such as categorizing objects into different groups based on their characteristics."
43,Confuses the terms edges and vertices,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the edges and vertices of a shape. Edges refer to the lines that connect the vertices of a shape, whereas vertices refer to the points where the edges meet. Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify or count the number of edges and vertices in a given shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the number of edges and vertices in a simple shape, such as a square or a triangle.
- When asked to describe the properties of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a pyramid, and they confuse the edges with the vertices.
- When solving problems involving perimeter and they incorrectly count the number of edges in a shape.
- When working with complex shapes, such as polygons with many sides, and they struggle to keep track of the edges and vertices."
44,"When adding or subtracting surds, just adds or subtracts the numbers under the surd rather than first trying to simplifying to find like surds","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. When adding or subtracting surds, students may mistakenly think that they can simply add or subtract the numbers under the surd sign, without considering whether the surds are ""like"" or not. Like surds are surds that have the same radicand (the number under the square root sign) and can be added or subtracted directly.

For example, students with this misconception may think that:

* √3 + √5 = √(3+5) = √8 (incorrect)
* 2√2 - √2 = 2 - 1 = 1 (incorrect)
* √6 + √2 = √(6+2) = √8 (incorrect)

This misconception can lead to incorrect results and a lack of understanding of how to handle surds in mathematical operations."
45,"When asked for the value of a digit, gives an answer 10 times too big","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of place value in a number. They tend to confuse the value of a digit with its face value multiplied by 10. This usually happens when students are not clear about the positional notation of numbers, where each digit's value is determined by its position in the number. As a result, when asked for the value of a digit in a specific place (e.g., tens, hundreds), they provide an answer that is 10 times larger than the actual value.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* When asked for the value of the digit '3' in the number 30, the student responds with 30 instead of 3.
* When asked for the value of the digit '4' in the number 450, the student responds with 40 instead of 4.
* When asked to find the value of the digit '2' in the number 200, the student responds with 20 instead of 2.
* When asked to identify the value of the digit '9' in the number 90, the student responds with 90 instead of 9."
46,Does not realise that division can be broken down into factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students view division as a single operation that cannot be broken down further, rather than understanding that it can be decomposed into simpler multiplication and division facts by using factors. For example, when dividing 24 by 6, students may not recognize that this can be broken down into simpler facts such as 24 ÷ (2 x 3) = 24 ÷ 2 ÷ 3. This can make division seem more complicated than it needs to be and can lead to difficulties with mental calculations and solving more complex problems.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When dividing large numbers, students may struggle to find the quotient because they do not recognize that the divisor can be broken down into simpler factors.
- When solving word problems that involve sharing or grouping, students may find it difficult to identify the most efficient way to divide the items because they do not consider the factors of the divisor.
- When performing calculations involving equivalent ratios or fractions, students may not realize that division can be simplified by using common factors."
47,Believes y=-f(x) is a reflection in y=x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the transformation y = -f(x) represents a reflection of the graph of y = f(x) across the line y = x. In reality, this transformation represents a reflection of the graph across the x-axis, not the line y = x. The line y = x is often associated with a different type of transformation, and students may get confused between these two distinct transformations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Graphing transformations of functions, where students are asked to graph y = -f(x) and mistakenly reflect the original graph across y = x.
- Case 2: Writing equations for transformed functions, where students incorrectly write the equation for a reflection across y = x as y = -f(x).
- Case 3: Identifying symmetry and reflections in graphs, where students mistakenly identify a graph as having been reflected across y = x when it has actually been reflected across the x-axis."
48,Thinks corresponding angles sum to 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between corresponding angles. They may believe that corresponding angles, which are angles that have the same position in two different intersections or corners, add up to 360 degrees. This is likely due to confusion with the concept of angles around a point, where the sum of the angles is indeed 360 degrees. However, corresponding angles are actually equal in measure, not supplementary or adding up to 360 degrees.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are working with intersecting lines and trying to calculate missing angles.
- When students are solving problems involving transversals and need to identify corresponding angles.
- When students are working with shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, and need to find missing angles using corresponding angles.
- When students are trying to find the sum of interior angles in polygons, but mistakenly apply the concept of corresponding angles summing to 360 degrees."
49,Doesn't believe that when you divide by 0 the answer will always be 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the concept of division and its relationship with zero. They may think that division is simply the opposite of multiplication, and since multiplying any number by 0 results in 0, they assume that dividing by 0 should also result in 0. They may not fully grasp the idea that division is only defined for non-zero numbers, and that dividing by 0 is undefined in mathematics.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When simplifying algebraic expressions, students may cancel out a 0 in the denominator, thinking that it will result in 0, rather than recognizing that it makes the expression undefined.
* When solving division problems, students may write 0 as the answer when dividing by 0, rather than indicating that the problem is undefined.
* When working with fractions, students may think that a fraction with a 0 denominator is equal to 0, rather than recognizing that it is undefined.
* When using calculators or computers, students may encounter an error message when dividing by 0, but may not understand why this is the case.
* When solving problems involving ratios or proportions, students may set up equations with 0 in the denominator, leading to incorrect solutions."
50,"When given a non-unit fraction of an amount and asked to find the total, answers as if it had been the unit fraction","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a problem that involves a non-unit fraction (e.g., 3/4, 2/3) of an amount, but they incorrectly assume it is a unit fraction (e.g., 1/4, 1/3). As a result, they calculate the total amount as if the non-unit fraction was a unit fraction.

For example:

- Case 1: If Sara has 3/4 of a bag of apples and each bag contains 12 apples, students might incorrectly calculate the total number of apples as if Sara had 1/4 of the bag, resulting in an incorrect answer.

- Case 2: If a recipe calls for 2/3 of a cup of sugar and students are asked to find the total amount of sugar needed if the recipe makes 6 cups, they may mistakenly calculate the total amount as if the recipe called for 1/3 of a cup.

- Case 3: If a bookshelf is 2/3 full and it can hold 18 books, students may incorrectly calculate the total number of books on the bookshelf as if it was 1/3 full."
51,Does not use angle facts when setting up an equation from an angle diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are given an angle diagram with various angles and relationships between them, but they fail to utilize the angle facts (such as complementary, supplementary, or corresponding angles) to set up an equation to solve for an unknown angle. Instead, they might rely solely on guesswork, basic arithmetic, or incorrect assumptions about the angle relationships.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When given a diagram with two angles forming a straight line (supplementary angles) and asked to find the value of one angle, a student might not recognize the relationship and instead try to calculate the angle using incorrect methods.
2. In a diagram with two angles forming a right angle (complementary angles), a student might not use the fact that the sum of the two angles is 90 degrees to set up an equation.
3. When dealing with a diagram of parallel lines cut by a transversal, a student might not apply the corresponding angles property to set up an equation to find an unknown angle.
4. In a triangle with angles labeled, a student might not use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees to set up an equation to solve for an unknown angle."
52,When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives the term before,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify a specific term in a sequence, but instead of providing the correct term, they provide the term that comes before it. This can be due to a misunderstanding of how sequences work or a lack of understanding of the term ""nth term."" Students may be counting the terms incorrectly, starting from 0 instead of 1, or simply confusing the term number with the position of the term in the sequence.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the 5th term in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, a student might answer 8 instead of 10.
- When identifying the 3rd term in the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, a student might respond with 2 instead of 4.
- When determining the 10th term in the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., a student might answer the 9th term instead of the 10th term."
53,Thinks circumference is radius x pi,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its radius. They mistakenly believe that the circumference is equal to the radius multiplied by pi (π), rather than the correct formula, which is that the circumference is equal to 2 times the radius multiplied by pi (2πr). This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the definition of circumference and the role of pi in the formula.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a problem that asks for the circumference of a circle and they are provided with the radius, they may write C = πr instead of C = 2πr.
- When solving a problem involving the perimeter of a circle, students may incorrectly use the radius times pi, rather than 2 times the radius times pi.
- In a real-world application, such as finding the distance around a circular track or the circumference of a pipe, students may use the incorrect formula, leading to inaccurate results.
- When comparing the circumferences of different circles, students may mistakenly think that a circle with a radius of 4 has a circumference equal to a circle with a diameter of 4, since they are using the incorrect formula C = πr."
54,Believes the arrow on a number line points to the middle value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the arrow or the tick mark on a number line indicates the midpoint or middle value of two numbers, rather than understanding it as a pointer to a specific value on the number line. For example, if a number line has marks at 0, 5, and 10, a student with this misconception might think the arrow or tick mark at 5 indicates the midpoint of 0 and 10, rather than representing the exact value of 5.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to identify specific values on a number line, they might point to the middle of two numbers, thinking the arrow or tick mark indicates the midpoint.
- When comparing numbers on a number line, students might incorrectly place a value at the midpoint of two numbers, rather than at its actual position.
- When using number lines to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, students with this misconception might incorrectly calculate the result due to their misunderstanding of the arrow's or tick mark's purpose."
55,"When subtracting a negative number from a positive number, uses a method which assumes one of the negative signs can be ignored ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with subtraction problems involving negative numbers. They might believe that subtracting a negative number is the same as simply adding the number without considering the effect of the negative sign on the operation. For instance, when solving the problem 5 - (-3), they might think they can ignore one of the negative signs and perform the operation as 5 - 3 or even 5 + 3 without understanding the actual process.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Subtracting a negative integer from a positive integer: 8 - (-2)
- Subtracting a negative fraction from a positive fraction: 1/2 - (-1/4)
- Solving algebraic expressions with negative numbers: x - (-y)
- Interpreting temperatures: if the temperature is 10°C and it drops by -5°C
- Calculating changes in financial values: a stock price increases by 5 and then decreases by -3."
56,Assumes a negative number is not rational,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that rational numbers are only positive and that negative numbers cannot be rational. They may think that rational numbers are limited to positive fractions or decimals, and that negative numbers are a separate entity that cannot be classified as rational. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the definition of rational numbers, which includes all numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, regardless of their sign.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* When simplifying fractions with negative numerators or denominators, students may assume that the resulting fraction is not rational.
* When comparing and ordering rational numbers, students may believe that negative rational numbers are not comparable to positive rational numbers.
* When solving algebraic equations, students may assume that negative solutions are not rational, leading to incorrect conclusions.
* When graphing rational functions, students may think that the graph cannot include negative rational numbers.
* When working with real-world problems, such as temperatures or financial transactions, students may not consider negative rational numbers as valid solutions."
57,Believes the solution to mx + c = a is the x intercept of y = mx +c,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that solving the equation mx + c = a for x gives the x-intercept of the line y = mx + c. They fail to understand that the x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, which occurs when y = 0. Instead, they think that solving for x in the equation mx + c = a will give them the x-intercept.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* Case 1: When finding the x-intercept of a linear equation, students may set the equation equal to a non-zero value (a) instead of zero, and then solve for x.
* Case 2: When solving a linear equation in the form of mx + c = a, students may incorrectly interpret the solution as the x-intercept of the line y = mx + c, rather than recognizing it as the value of x that makes the equation true.
* Case 3: When graphing a linear equation, students may plot the solution to mx + c = a as the x-intercept, resulting in an incorrect graph."
58,"When dividing, confuses the remainder with the quotient","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of division and confuse the remainder (the amount left over after dividing) with the quotient (the result of the division). They may think that the remainder is the answer to the division problem, rather than the amount left over after finding the quotient.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing 17 by 5, a student may write the answer as 2 (the remainder) instead of 3 (the quotient) with a remainder of 2.
- When solving a problem that asks for the number of groups of 4 that can be made from 21 items, a student may answer 1 (the remainder) instead of 5 (the quotient) with a remainder of 1.
- When dividing 24 by 9, a student may write the answer as 6 (the remainder is actually 6 when 24 is divided by 9 and the quotient is 2 with a remainder of 6)"
59,Cannot identify a common factor when simplifying algebraic fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to recognize common factors between the numerator and denominator of an algebraic fraction, making it difficult for them to simplify the fraction. Students may not fully understand the concept of equivalent fractions or may not be able to identify the common factors, especially when dealing with variables and constants. They might think that the fraction is already in its simplest form or may try to simplify it incorrectly.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- Simplifying a fraction like (2x + 4) / (2x + 2), where the student fails to recognize the common factor of 2.
- Reducing a fraction like (x^2 + 3x) / (x + 3), where the student misses the common factor of (x + 3).
- Simplifying a fraction like (6x) / (3x + 6), where the student is unable to identify the common factor of 3 or the fact that it's not the only factor to consider."
60,"Has written the value of the 'ones' column as the answer, withiut using the numbers in the question.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to perform arithmetic operations involving multi-digit numbers, but instead of considering the entire number, they only focus on the 'ones' column and write its value as the answer, disregarding the numbers provided in the question.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding or subtracting multi-digit numbers, a student might only look at the 'ones' column and write its value as the answer, without considering the tens, hundreds, or thousands columns.
- When performing multiplication or division, a student might focus solely on the 'ones' column of the multiplicand or dividend, ignoring the other digits and the actual calculation required.
- In word problems involving arithmetic operations, students may only consider the 'ones' column of a number mentioned in the problem and write its value as the answer, without taking into account the context and the actual numbers involved in the problem."
61,Multiplies by 10 instead of 100 when converting decimal to percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting a decimal to a percentage. They understand that to convert a decimal to a percentage, they need to multiply it by a certain factor. However, they mistakenly believe that the factor is 10 instead of 100. As a result, they multiply the decimal by 10, which leads to an incorrect percentage value.

For example, if the decimal is 0.25, students with this misconception would multiply it by 10, resulting in 2.5, instead of the correct 25% (which is obtained by multiplying 0.25 by 100).

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Converting 0.5 to a percentage: Students will answer 5% instead of 50%.
- Converting 0.8 to a percentage: Students will answer 8% is correct in this case but if the decimal is 0.08 they will answer 0.8% instead of 8%.
- Converting 0.125 to a percentage: Students will answer 1.25% instead of 12.5%."
62,Does not realise that a curved line represents a changing gradient,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret curved lines as having a constant or single gradient, rather than understanding that the gradient is changing along the curve. They might perceive the curve as a series of connected straight lines, each with its own constant gradient, or believe that the gradient remains the same throughout the curve. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect conclusions when working with real-world applications, such as motion, optimization problems, or interpreting graphs.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify or calculate the gradient of a curve at a specific point.
* When analyzing real-world data, such as the trajectory of a projectile, population growth, or temperature changes over time, which often exhibit curved patterns.
* When working with mathematical models that involve curves, such as quadratic or polynomial functions, and being asked to interpret the meaning of the curve in context.
* When graphing functions and misinterpreting the steepness or rate of change of the curve.
* When solving optimization problems, such as finding the maximum or minimum of a function, and misunderstanding how the gradient changes along the curve."
63,Believes 'data' and 'sample' are interchangeable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between the terms 'data' and 'sample'. They may think that any set of information is both data and a sample, without realizing the specific context in which these terms are used. In statistics, 'data' refers to the actual information collected, whereas a 'sample' refers to a subset of the population from which the data is collected. Students with this misconception may use these terms loosely, without understanding the implications of each term.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to describe the data collection process, a student might say, ""We took a data from the population,"" instead of ""We took a sample from the population.""
- In a survey, a student might claim, ""Our data is 100 students,"" when they actually mean that their sample consists of 100 students from a larger population.
- When analyzing a statistical problem, a student might mistakenly say, ""The data is biased,"" when they actually mean that the sample is biased, leading to incorrect conclusions about the population."
64,Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 4,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number (i.e., raising it to the power of 2) is equivalent to multiplying the number by 4. For example, they might think that 6 squared (6²) is equal to 6 × 4, rather than 6 × 6.

This misconception may arise from an incomplete understanding of the concept of exponentiation, specifically the meaning of squaring a number. Students may be familiar with multiplying numbers by 4, but they may not fully grasp the idea that squaring a number involves multiplying it by itself.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying algebraic expressions: When simplifying expressions like (3x)², students might mistakenly think it equals 3x × 4 instead of (3x) × (3x).
2. Solving quadratic equations: In equations like x² = 16, students might incorrectly assume that x = 4 (since 4 × 4 = 16), not realizing that x could also be -4 (since (-4) × (-4) = 16).
3. Calculating areas of squares: When finding the area of a square with a side length of 5 units, students might mistakenly think the area is 5 × 4 instead of 5 × 5.
4. Evaluating numerical expressions: When evaluating expressions like 2² + 3², students might incorrectly calculate 2 × 4 + 3 × 4 instead of 2 × 2 + 3 × 3."
65,Cannot spot a variable within a written scenario,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to identify the variable or the unknown quantity within a word problem or a written scenario. They may have difficulty distinguishing between the given information, the constants, and the variable that needs to be solved for. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the problem's context, poor reading comprehension, or inadequate experience in translating word problems into mathematical equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a problem like ""Tom has 5 more pencils than his friend Alex. If Alex has 8 pencils, how many pencils does Tom have?"", students may not recognize that the number of pencils Tom has is the variable.
- Case 2: In a scenario like ""A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many books can be placed on it in total?"", students may not identify the total number of books as the variable.
- Case 3: In a problem like ""A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. If they make a profit of $0.50 per loaf, how much profit do they make in a day?"", students may not recognize the profit as the variable.
- Case 4: In a scenario like ""A car travels from City A to City B at an average speed of 60 km/h. If the distance between the two cities is 240 km, how many hours does the trip take?"", students may not identify the time as the variable."
66,Repeats the digits three times when cubing a number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that cubing a number involves simply repeating the digits of the original number three times. For example, they might think that 5 cubed (5³) is equal to 555, because they are repeating the digit 5 three times. This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of the concept of exponentiation and the meaning of the cube operation.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When a student is asked to find the cube of a single-digit number, like 2³ or 4³.
* When a student is faced with a simple multiplication problem that can be solved using the cube operation, like 2 × 2 × 2.
* When a student is asked to apply the cube operation to a real-world problem, like calculating the volume of a cube-shaped container.
* When a student is working with larger numbers and is asked to find the cube of a multi-digit number, like 10³ or 20³."
67,Divides by 1000 instead of 100 when converting a decimal to a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting a decimal to a percentage. They understand that to convert a decimal to a percentage, they need to multiply the decimal by 100, but some students get confused with the place value of decimals and think that since there are three decimal places (e.g., 0.025), they need to multiply or ""move the decimal"" three places, effectively multiplying or dividing by 1000 instead of 100.

This misconception can be seen in the following cases:

- Converting 0.025 to a percentage: A student might divide by 1000 and get 0.025% instead of the correct answer of 2.5%.
- Converting 0.5 to a percentage: A student might think that since there is only one decimal place, they need to ""move the decimal"" three places to get a percentage and end up with 0.05% instead of the correct answer of 50%.
- Converting 0.125 to a percentage: A student might divide by 1000 and get 0.0125% instead of the correct answer of 12.5%."
68,Confuses a term with an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of an algebraic term and an equation. They tend to treat a term, which is a single part of an expression, as if it were a full equation that can be solved on its own. For example, students might think that a term like '2x' is an equation and try to solve for 'x', not realizing that it's just one part of a larger expression.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, students might try to isolate a single term as if it's an equation.
- When solving equations, students might mistakenly apply operations to individual terms rather than the entire equation.
- When working with word problems, students might incorrectly translate the problem into a single term instead of forming a complete equation.
- When dealing with algebraic identities, students might confuse the individual terms with separate equations, leading to incorrect manipulations.
- When expanding or factoring expressions, students might mistakenly treat individual terms as separate equations to be solved."
69,"When given a non-unit fraction of an amount, treats it like a unit fraction","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are given a non-unit fraction (a fraction with a numerator greater than 1) of an amount, but they treat it as if it were a unit fraction (a fraction with a numerator of 1). For example, if asked to find 3/4 of 12, a student with this misconception may find 1/4 of 12 and then not multiply it by 3, or they may find 1/4 and add it together three times but not consider the value of the three groups of the unit fraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding 3/4 of 12 pencils, the student calculates 1/4 of 12, which is 3, and gives 3 as the answer.
- When asked to find 2/3 of 18, the student calculates 1/3 of 18, which is 6, but fails to multiply 6 by 2 to find the correct answer.
- When asked to share 15 cookies among friends using 3/5 as a non-unit fraction, the student only finds 1/5 of the cookies and doesn't consider the other 2 parts of the fraction."
70,"When reading a composite bar chart, just reads total height of bar","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are interpreting composite bar charts, which are charts that display multiple bars on top of each other to show the breakdown of different categories. Students with this misconception tend to focus solely on the total height of the bar, rather than considering the individual components that make up the total. They may not realize that each section of the bar represents a specific category or subset of data.

This misconception can lead students to misinterpret the data and draw incorrect conclusions. For example, they may compare the total height of two bars without considering the differences in the individual components, or they may fail to recognize the relationships between the different categories.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When comparing the sales of different products, a student might say, ""Product A is the most popular because its bar is the tallest,"" without realizing that the bar is composed of multiple segments representing different sales channels (e.g., online, in-store, etc.).
* When analyzing a composite bar chart showing the number of hours spent on different activities, a student might conclude, ""People spend the most time watching TV because the TV bar is the tallest,"" without considering the individual components of the bar that represent different age groups or demographics.
* When interpreting a composite bar chart displaying the results of a survey, a student might say, ""The majority of people prefer Option A because its bar is the tallest,"" without realizing that the bar is composed of multiple segments representing different subgroups (e.g., males, females, etc.)."
71,Multiplies all given dimensions when calculating an area,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a shape and they mistakenly multiply all the given dimensions, including those that are not relevant to the area calculation. This often happens when students are dealing with shapes that have multiple dimensions, such as a rectangular prism or a triangular prism. 

For example, when calculating the area of a rectangular prism, students might multiply the length, width, and height together, instead of just multiplying the length and width to find the area of the base. Similarly, when calculating the area of a triangular prism, students might multiply the base, height, and length of the prism together, instead of just multiplying the base and height to find the area of the triangle.

This misconception can also occur when students are working with compound shapes, where they need to find the total area by adding or subtracting the areas of individual shapes. In such cases, students might incorrectly multiply all the dimensions together, resulting in an incorrect area calculation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the area of a rectangular prism with a length of 5 units, width of 3 units, and height of 2 units. (Student might multiply 5 x 3 x 2 instead of 5 x 3)
- Calculating the area of a triangular prism with a base of 4 units, height of 6 units, and length of 8 units. (Student might multiply 4 x 6 x 8 instead of 0.5 x 4 x 6)
- Finding the total area of a compound shape consisting of a rectangle and a triangle. (Student might multiply all dimensions together instead of adding or subtracting individual areas)"
72,Thinks a decimal can be written as a fraction by just writing it under a numerator of 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any decimal can be converted into a fraction by simply placing the decimal value as the numerator and using 1 as the denominator. They may not understand that to convert a decimal to a fraction, they need to express it in terms of its place value (e.g., tenths, hundredths, etc.) as the denominator.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: Student tries to convert 0.5 into a fraction and writes 0.5/1 instead of 1/2 or 5/10.
* Case 2: Student attempts to convert 0.25 into a fraction and writes 0.25/1 instead of 1/4 or 25/100.
* Case 3: Student tries to convert 0.75 into a fraction and writes 0.75/1 instead of 3/4 or 75/100."
73,Confuses a function with an expression,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a function, which represents a relationship between variables, and an expression, which is a mathematical statement consisting of numbers, variables, and operators. Students may think that any expression with variables is a function, without realizing that a function must assign each input value to exactly one output value. They may also believe that an expression is a function simply because it contains variables, without considering the relationship between those variables.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When simplifying algebraic expressions, students may refer to the simplified expression as a function, without recognizing that it only becomes a function when it is defined with a specific input-output relationship.
* When graphing, students may plot an expression on a coordinate plane and assume that it represents a function, without checking if each x-value corresponds to only one y-value.
* When solving equations, students may treat an expression as if it were a function, attempting to ""evaluate"" it for a specific value, without realizing that the expression does not define a unique output for that input.
* When working with word problems, students may interpret a mathematical expression as a function, even if it does not model a functional relationship between the variables in the problem."
74,Believes they must expand brackets before solving an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to equations that involve brackets or parentheses. They might have been previously taught to expand brackets in algebraic expressions to simplify them, which often makes the expressions easier to work with. However, when it comes to solving equations, students might mistakenly believe that expanding the brackets is always the first step, even if it is not necessary or might complicate the equation. This misconception could stem from an overemphasis on the expansion of brackets in earlier lessons or a lack of exposure to equations where it's beneficial to leave the brackets intact.

Cases where this misconception might occur:

1. Solving linear equations like 2(x + 3) = 12, where students might expand the brackets to get 2x + 6 = 12 before solving for x.
2. Working with quadratic equations, such as (x + 2)(x - 3) = 0, where students might expand the brackets to get x^2 - x - 6 = 0, rather than using the factored form to find the solutions.
3. Dealing with equations involving fractions, like (x + 1)/2 = 3, where students might incorrectly expand the brackets or try to get rid of the fraction before isolating x."
75,Believes that the directions of positive and negative vectors are the opposite way around.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the direction of a positive vector points in the opposite direction to what is conventionally accepted, and vice versa for negative vectors. In other words, they may think that a positive vector points in the direction that is typically associated with a negative vector, and a negative vector points in the direction that is typically associated with a positive vector.

For example, on a number line, a student with this misconception may believe that a positive vector (e.g. +3) points to the left, while a negative vector (e.g. -3) points to the right. Similarly, in a coordinate system, they may think that a positive vector in the x-direction points towards the left, while a negative vector points towards the right.

This misconception can lead to errors when performing operations with vectors, such as addition and subtraction, and can also cause confusion when interpreting the results of vector calculations.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Graphing vectors on a coordinate plane: Students may plot vectors in the opposite direction to what is intended, leading to incorrect representations of the vectors.
- Vector addition and subtraction: Students may incorrectly combine vectors, resulting in incorrect magnitudes and directions.
- Resolving vectors into components: Students may mistakenly assign the wrong signs to the components of a vector, leading to incorrect calculations.
- Interpreting the results of vector calculations: Students may misinterpret the results of vector calculations, such as thinking that a positive result indicates a direction opposite to what is actually intended."
76,Confuses quadratic and exponential graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to distinguish between the characteristics of quadratic and exponential graphs. Quadratic graphs are typically U-shaped and symmetrical, while exponential graphs display rapid growth or decay. However, students may confuse the curved shape of both types of graphs, leading them to incorrectly identify one as the other.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: When graphing a quadratic equation with a large coefficient of x^2, the graph may appear to be increasing or decreasing rapidly, similar to an exponential graph.
- Case 2: When an exponential graph is in its early stages, it may resemble a quadratic graph, leading students to mistakenly identify it as such.
- Case 3: When working with real-world data, students may struggle to determine whether the data is best modeled by a quadratic or exponential function, especially if the data has a complex or irregular pattern.
- Case 4: When graphing functions on a limited scale or domain, the differences between quadratic and exponential graphs may not be immediately apparent, leading to confusion between the two.
- Case 5: When students are faced with word problems that describe a situation that could be modeled by either a quadratic or exponential function, they may incorrectly choose the wrong type of function due to a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts."
77,"Does not follow the arrows through a function machine, changes the order of the operations asked.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with function machines, which are often used to represent algebraic functions. A function machine is a visual representation of a function, with an input and an output, and a series of operations that are applied to the input to produce the output. The operations are often represented by arrows, with each arrow indicating a specific operation, such as ""add 2"" or ""multiply by 3"".

Students with this misconception may not follow the arrows in the correct order, or may change the order of the operations. For example, if the function machine shows an arrow for ""add 2"" followed by an arrow for ""multiply by 3"", a student with this misconception may first multiply by 3 and then add 2, rather than following the correct order of operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When working with simple function machines that involve two or more operations, such as ""add 2"" and ""multiply by 3"".
* When dealing with more complex function machines that involve multiple arrows and operations, such as ""subtract 1"", ""multiply by 2"", and ""add 3"".
* When faced with word problems that involve applying multiple operations in a specific order, such as ""Tom has 5 pencils and he gives 2 to his friend, then he buys 3 more pencils"".
* When working with algebraic expressions that involve multiple operations, such as 2(x + 3) or (x - 2) × 4."
78,"When multiplying a fraction by an integer, multiplies the denominator instead of the numerator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions by integers. They may incorrectly assume that the multiplication operation should be applied to the denominator of the fraction, rather than the numerator. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and how multiplication affects the size of a fraction.

For example, when multiplying 1/2 by 3, students with this misconception may write 1/6 instead of 3/2. This is because they are incorrectly multiplying the denominator (2) by 3, resulting in a denominator of 6.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying a fraction by a whole number in a word problem: ""Tom has 1/4 of a pizza and he wants to make 5 identical pizzas. How much pizza will he have in total?""
- Simplifying expressions involving fractions and integers: 2 × 3/4
- Solving problems involving equivalent ratios: ""A recipe calls for 1/2 cup of flour. If you want to make 4 times the recipe, how much flour will you need?"""
79,Does not understand how to divide algebraic terms,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the rules and procedures for dividing algebraic expressions, which involve variables and constants. They may incorrectly apply the rules of arithmetic division or fail to recognize the importance of handling variables and their exponents properly. For instance, students might think that dividing by a variable is the same as dividing by a number, or they may not understand how to handle cases where the divisor has a higher degree than the dividend.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Dividing a monomial by another monomial, e.g., 6x^2 ÷ 2x
- Dividing a polynomial by a monomial, e.g., (4x^2 + 3x) ÷ x
- Dividing a polynomial by another polynomial, e.g., (x^2 + 3x + 2) ÷ (x + 1)
- Dividing expressions with negative exponents or fractions, e.g., (2x^-2) ÷ (3x^-1)
- Simplifying algebraic fractions by dividing the numerator and denominator by a common factor, e.g., (x^2 + 2x) / (x + 2)"
80,Thinks you can ignore the variable when simplifying algebraic fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students treat algebraic fractions as numerical fractions and ignore the variable while simplifying. They might cancel out terms without considering the variable, leading to incorrect simplifications. For instance, when simplifying a fraction like (2x + 4) / (2x), they might cancel out the '2' without considering the variable 'x', resulting in an incorrect simplification.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying algebraic fractions with common factors in the numerator and denominator, e.g., (3x + 6) / (3x).
- Canceling out terms in algebraic fractions with variables in both the numerator and denominator, e.g., (x + 2) / x.
- Simplifying algebraic expressions with multiple variables, e.g., (2x + 4y) / (2x).
- Reducing algebraic fractions to their simplest form, e.g., (x^2 + 4x) / x."
81,Thinks you subtract rather than add when finding the previous term in a descending linear sequence,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with a descending linear sequence, where each term decreases by a fixed constant. They may incorrectly believe that to find the previous term, they need to subtract the common difference from the current term, rather than adding it. This is because they might associate the concept of ""going back"" or ""decreasing"" with subtraction, rather than understanding that adding the negative difference (or adding the opposite of the common difference) is necessary to move backwards in the sequence.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Finding the previous term in a simple descending sequence, such as 10, 8, 6, 4, ...
- Identifying the missing term in a pattern like 20, 18, __, 14, ...
- Solving a problem that involves finding the term that comes before a given term in a descending linear sequence."
82,Believes the square of a negative will also be negative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to negative numbers and are asked to square them. They mistakenly assume that since the number is negative, the result of squaring it will also be negative. This misconception likely stems from a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and the concept of squaring a number, which results in a positive value regardless of the original number's sign.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Squaring a negative integer, e.g., (-3)²
- Squaring a negative decimal, e.g., (-0.5)²
- Squaring a negative fraction, e.g., (-1/2)²
- Simplifying algebraic expressions involving negative numbers, e.g., (x - 3)² when x is a negative value."
83,Confuses the meaning of perpendicular and vertical ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that 'perpendicular' and 'vertical' are interchangeable terms. They may think that any line that is vertical (i.e., going up and down) is automatically perpendicular to a given line or surface. However, perpendicularity is a more specific concept that refers to two lines or planes that intersect at a 90-degree angle. A line can be vertical without being perpendicular to another line, and a line can be perpendicular to another line without being vertical.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or identifying right angles in shapes, students may incorrectly label any vertical line as perpendicular to a horizontal line, without checking if the lines actually intersect at a 90-degree angle.
- When working with coordinate geometry, students may assume that a vertical line is perpendicular to the x-axis, without considering the slope of the line.
- In real-world applications, such as building design or engineering, students may incorrectly assume that a vertical support beam is automatically perpendicular to a horizontal surface, which could lead to incorrect calculations or designs."
84,Believes greater than/less than symbols include end values,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the greater than (>) and less than (<) symbols include the end values they are being compared to. For example, if a question states ""x > 5"", students with this misconception may think that x can be equal to 5, when in fact it means x must be any value greater than 5, excluding 5 itself. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect answers and a lack of understanding of how to accurately represent and compare values using these symbols.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* A question asks to solve the inequality 2x > 4, and the student includes 2 as a possible value for x.
* A graphing problem asks to shade the region where x < 3, and the student shades up to and including the line x = 3.
* A word problem states that a person must be taller than 160cm to ride a rollercoaster, and the student thinks someone who is exactly 160cm tall can ride."
85,Does not remember that a rhombus has equal sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recall or recognize that a fundamental property of a rhombus is that all four sides are of equal length. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly identify or draw a rhombus, often confusing it with other quadrilaterals such as rectangles or parallelograms that do not have this unique characteristic.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to define the properties of a rhombus, a student may list characteristics like having four right angles or opposite sides being parallel, but fail to mention the equal side lengths.
- When given a set of shapes to classify, a student may group a rhombus with other quadrilaterals without recognizing its distinct property of having equal sides.
- When tasked with drawing a rhombus, a student may draw a shape with unequal sides, demonstrating their misunderstanding of the shape's fundamental properties.
- When solving problems involving perimeter or area of a rhombus, a student's calculations may be incorrect due to their failure to account for the equal side lengths."
86,Assumes value of symbols in a pictogram without checking the key,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with pictograms, which are a type of chart that uses symbols or pictures to represent data. They may assume that each symbol in the pictogram has a specific value, such as one symbol representing one unit of data, without checking the key or legend that explains what each symbol actually represents. This can lead to incorrect interpretations of the data.

For example, in a pictogram showing the number of pets owned by students in a class, a student may assume that each picture of a cat represents one cat, when in fact the key states that each picture represents two cats. This would result in the student underestimating the total number of cats.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is analyzing a pictogram showing the number of books read by a class, and assumes each book symbol represents one book, when the key states that each symbol represents five books.
* A student is interpreting a pictogram showing the number of hours spent watching TV, and assumes each TV symbol represents one hour, when the key states that each symbol represents two hours.
* A student is working with a pictogram showing the number of fruits eaten by a group of people, and assumes each fruit symbol represents one fruit, when the key states that each symbol represents a basket of five fruits."
87,Does not know what an exterior angle is ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the concept of exterior angles in geometry. An exterior angle is formed by one side of a polygon and the extension of an adjacent side. Students may struggle to identify exterior angles, confusing them with interior angles or failing to recognize the relationship between exterior angles and the shape of the polygon.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When asked to identify and label exterior angles in a diagram, students may incorrectly label interior angles or angles that are not part of the polygon.
* When solving problems involving the sum of exterior angles of a polygon, students may apply the formula for the sum of interior angles instead.
* When working with real-world applications, such as designing buildings or bridges, students may fail to consider the exterior angles of the structure, leading to incorrect calculations and designs.
* When solving problems involving the relationship between exterior angles and the number of sides in a polygon, students may become confused and provide incorrect answers."
88,Believes parallelogram is the term used to describe two lines at right angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of a parallelogram and associate it with the concept of perpendicular lines. They may believe that any two lines that intersect at right angles (90 degrees) form a parallelogram, which is not the case. This misconception may stem from the fact that some parallelograms, such as rectangles and squares, do have right angles, but not all shapes with right angles are parallelograms.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify shapes in real-life objects, they may incorrectly label a corner of a room or a book as a parallelogram simply because it has right angles.
* When drawing or constructing shapes, students may draw two lines at right angles and claim to have drawn a parallelogram, without considering the other defining characteristics of a parallelogram, such as having four sides and opposite sides being parallel.
* When solving geometry problems, students may incorrectly assume that any shape with right angles is a parallelogram, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
89,Thinks it can't be called a sequence with a repeated number at the start,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of what constitutes a sequence. They might believe that a sequence must start with distinct numbers and that repetition of a number at the beginning invalidates it as a sequence. They may think that sequences must have a clear, incremental, or decremental pattern from the start, and that repetition of the first number disrupts this pattern. This misconception could stem from an overemphasis on simple arithmetic sequences in their early math education, leading them to generalize that all sequences must follow a straightforward, non-repeating pattern.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify if a given series of numbers is a sequence, and the series starts with repeated numbers, such as 2, 2, 4, 6, 8.
- When tasked with creating their own sequence and they are hesitant to start with a repeated number, thinking it would not be considered a valid sequence.
- In word problems where a real-life scenario is described, involving a sequence that starts with a repeated number, and students are asked to identify or work with the sequence, such as analyzing the pattern of hours worked per day over a week when the first two days had the same number of hours worked."
90,Does not understand place value after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of place value when dealing with decimal numbers. They may have difficulty understanding that the place value system extends beyond whole numbers and applies to decimal numbers as well. Students may mistakenly think that the digits after the decimal point do not have specific place values or that the place values are not related to the whole number part.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Difficulty in comparing decimal numbers, e.g., thinking 0.5 is greater than 0.51 because they focus on the whole number part (0) rather than the decimal part.
* Inability to round decimal numbers correctly, e.g., rounding 4.27 to 4.2 instead of 4.3.
* Struggling to perform arithmetic operations with decimal numbers, e.g., adding or subtracting decimals without aligning the decimal points.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

* When asked to compare two decimal numbers, such as 0.45 and 0.5, students may incorrectly say that 0.45 is greater than 0.5.
* When rounding a decimal number, such as 3.87, students may round it to 3.8 instead of 3.9.
* When performing arithmetic operations with decimals, such as 2.5 + 1.8, students may incorrectly add the numbers without aligning the decimal points."
91,"When asked for factors of an algebraic expression, thinks any part of a term will be a factor","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of factors in algebraic expressions. They tend to identify any part of a term as a factor, rather than understanding that a factor must be an expression that divides the original expression exactly without leaving a remainder. For example, in the expression 2x + 4, students with this misconception might identify '2', 'x', and '4' as factors, without recognizing that these are merely components of the terms rather than factors of the entire expression.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to factor simple algebraic expressions, such as 3x + 6, and they respond with individual components like '3', 'x', and '6'.
- When students are given an expression like x^2 + 4x and they incorrectly identify 'x' as a factor, without considering that a factor must be an expression that can be multiplied to produce the original expression.
- When students are working with more complex expressions, such as 2x^2 + 5x + 3, and they mistakenly identify individual terms or components as factors, rather than looking for expressions that divide the entire expression exactly."
92,"When identifying the center of rotation, writes down the origin","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify the center of rotation of a shape that has been rotated in a coordinate plane. The students mistakenly assume that the center of rotation is always the origin (0,0), regardless of the actual rotation or the shape's position. They fail to consider that the center of rotation can be any point in the plane, not just the origin.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When a shape is rotated around a point other than the origin, but the student still writes down (0,0) as the center of rotation.
- When a shape is rotated in a coordinate plane with a non-standard orientation, and the student assumes the center of rotation is still the origin.
- When a shape undergoes multiple transformations, including rotation, and the student incorrectly identifies the origin as the center of rotation for each transformation.
- When a student is given a diagram of a rotated shape without a clear indication of the center of rotation and they default to the origin as the answer."
93,"When multiplying a surd of the form a✓b by an integer, believes the integer and the number under the surd are multiplied","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with surds, which are numbers expressed as the square root of another number. When multiplying a surd of the form a✓b by an integer, students may incorrectly assume that the integer multiplies both 'a' and the number under the square root sign 'b', rather than just multiplying 'a' by the integer and keeping the surd part intact.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: 3 × 2✓5. Students may incorrectly calculate this as 6✓15 instead of 6✓5.
- Case 2: 4 × 3✓2. Students may incorrectly calculate this as 12✓8 instead of 12✓2.
- Case 3: 2 × 5✓3. Students may incorrectly calculate this as 10✓6 instead of 10✓3."
94,"When solving simultaneous equations, thinks they can add variables to one of the equations to make terms across the 2 equations identical","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the fundamental concept of solving simultaneous equations. They may believe that by adding a variable to one equation, they can create identical terms in both equations, making it easier to eliminate one of the variables. However, this approach ignores the fact that adding a variable to one equation changes the equation's overall value and relationship between the variables.

For instance, if the two equations are:

2x + 3y = 7
x - 2y = -3

A student with this misconception might add 2y to the second equation to make the terms with y identical, resulting in:

2x + 3y = 7
x = -3 + 2y

Or, they might add x to the first equation to make the terms with x identical, resulting in:

3x + 3y = 7 + x
x - 2y = -3

In both cases, the student has altered the original equation, leading to incorrect solutions. This misconception can occur when students are first introduced to solving simultaneous equations and struggle to understand the algebraic manipulations required to eliminate variables."
95,Does not know about the + notation for directions in rotations,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the convention of using a plus sign (+) to indicate clockwise rotations and a minus sign (-) to indicate counter-clockwise rotations. They may understand the concept of rotation but struggle to apply it when given a direction with a + notation. For example, if a student is asked to rotate a shape 90 degrees +, they may not understand that it means to rotate the shape 90 degrees clockwise.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a diagram with rotation instructions that include the + notation, but they have not been explicitly taught what it means.
- When students are asked to describe a rotation in words, but they use the wrong terminology, such as saying ""turn right"" instead of ""rotate 90 degrees +"".
- When students are solving problems that involve rotations in geometry, such as finding the image of a point after a rotation, but they misinterpret the direction due to the + notation.
- When students are working with bearings and directions in real-world applications, such as navigation, and they need to understand the convention of using + for clockwise directions."
96,Multiplies surds when asked to add,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the rules of multiplication to addition when working with surds (radicals). They may incorrectly assume that when adding surds, they need to multiply the numbers inside the radical signs, rather than adding them separately.

For example, when asked to add √3 + √5, students with this misconception may multiply the numbers inside the radical signs, resulting in an incorrect answer of √15. This shows a lack of understanding of the rules for adding surds and the properties of radicals.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Adding two or more surds with different numbers inside the radical sign, e.g., √2 + √3
* Adding a surd to a whole number, e.g., 2 + √5
* Adding surds with coefficients, e.g., 2√3 + 3√5
* Adding surds in algebraic expressions, e.g., √x + √y"
97,Believes there is only one orientation for the isosceles triangle base angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the base angles of an isosceles triangle can only be oriented in one specific way. They might think that the base angles must always be at the bottom of the triangle, or that the vertex angle must always be at the top. As a result, they may struggle to identify isosceles triangles when they are presented in different orientations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or identifying isosceles triangles, students may insist that the base must be horizontal and the vertex angle must be at the top.
- When solving problems involving isosceles triangles, students may assume that the base angles are always in a specific position, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- When working with real-world applications of isosceles triangles, such as in architecture or design, students may fail to recognize isosceles triangles when they are presented in different orientations, limiting their ability to apply mathematical concepts to practical problems.
- When given a triangle with two equal sides, students may incorrectly assume that the base angles must be at the bottom, rather than recognizing that the triangle can be oriented in different ways."
98,Incorrectly clears fractions from equations,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly eliminate fractions from equations, often by multiplying or dividing only one side of the equation by the denominator, or by adding/subtracting fractions with different denominators without finding a common denominator. They may also incorrectly simplify or cancel out terms involving fractions. This can lead to an incorrect solution or an equation that is no longer equivalent to the original one.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When solving linear equations with fractions, such as 1/2x + 1/3 = 2/3.
- When working with rational expressions, like (x+1)/2 = (x-1)/3.
- When dealing with equations involving mixed numbers, for example, 2 1/2x = 5 3/4.
- When solving inequalities with fractions, such as 2/3x > 1/2.
- When simplifying algebraic expressions involving fractions, like (2x + 1)/4 + (x - 2)/2."
99,Thinks the faster you travel the longer the time it will take,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the relationship between speed, distance, and time. They may believe that increasing speed will somehow increase the time it takes to cover a certain distance, possibly due to a misunderstanding of how speed affects the duration of travel. This misconception may stem from an intuitive, but incorrect, assumption that faster speeds make time pass more slowly or that it takes longer to cover a certain distance because you're ""using up"" more speed.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the time it takes to travel a certain distance at different speeds, students may incorrectly assume that a faster speed results in a longer travel time.
- When comparing the travel times of two objects moving at different speeds, students may think the faster object will take longer to cover the same distance.
- When solving problems involving speed, distance, and time, students may incorrectly apply formulas or reasoning, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between speed and travel time.
- When analyzing real-world scenarios, such as travel times for cars, planes, or other vehicles, students may misinterpret the effects of speed on travel time, leading to incorrect conclusions or predictions."
100,Believes angles in a triangle sum to 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the concept that the sum of angles in a circle (360 degrees) to a triangle. They may incorrectly recall or generalize the rule for the sum of angles in a circle to other shapes, including triangles. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding or confusion about the fundamental properties of triangles and angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the missing angle in a triangle, a student might subtract the given angles from 360 degrees instead of 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles in different polygons, students might incorrectly apply the 360-degree rule to triangles.
- In geometry problems, students might incorrectly assume that the sum of angles in a right triangle or an equilateral triangle is 360 degrees, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.
- When comparing the properties of different shapes, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons, students might mistakenly attribute the 360-degree sum of angles to triangles.
- In real-world applications, such as design or construction, students might make errors in calculations or measurements if they incorrectly assume that the sum of angles in a triangle is 360 degrees."
101,Believes that reflection always switches the x and y coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the concept of reflection across the line y = x, where the x and y coordinates are indeed swapped to obtain the reflected point. They mistakenly believe that this swapping of coordinates applies to all types of reflections, regardless of the axis or line of reflection.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When reflecting a point across the x-axis (e.g., reflecting (2, 3) across the x-axis), students may incorrectly swap the coordinates and write the reflected point as (3, 2) instead of the correct (2, -3).
- When reflecting a point across the y-axis (e.g., reflecting (2, 3) across the y-axis), students may incorrectly swap the coordinates and write the reflected point as (3, 2) instead of the correct (-2, 3).
- When reflecting a point across a line that is not the x-axis, y-axis, or y = x (e.g., reflecting (2, 3) across the line y = 2x), students may still incorrectly swap the coordinates, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the reflection process."
102,Does not think a factorised expression is equivalent to its multiplied out form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that an algebraic expression in its factorized form represents the same value as the expression in its expanded form. They may perceive the two forms as distinct and unrelated, rather than understanding that they are equivalent representations of the same expression. 

For instance, students may struggle to see that the factorized expression (x + 2)(x + 3) is equivalent to its expanded form, x^2 + 5x + 6. They might view these two expressions as different entities, rather than recognizing that they represent the same value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Expanding and factoring quadratic expressions: When students are given an expression in its factorized form and asked to expand it, they may not understand that the resulting expanded form represents the same value.
- Simplifying algebraic expressions: When students are asked to simplify an expression, they may not recognize that a factorized form can be an equivalent and simplified version of an expanded expression.
- Solving equations: When students are solving equations and encounter an expression in its factorized form, they may not understand that they can use the expanded form to help solve the equation."
103,"When completing the square, believes the constant in the bracket is double the coefficient of x","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They mistakenly think that when rewriting the quadratic expression in the form (x + a)^2, the constant term 'a' inside the bracket should be double the coefficient of x. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the process of completing the square, where the coefficient of x is halved and then squared to find the constant term to be added inside the bracket.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When completing the square for the expression x^2 + 6x, a student might think the correct form is (x + 6)^2 instead of (x + 3)^2.
- In the quadratic expression x^2 + 8x + 5, a student might attempt to rewrite it as (x + 8)^2 + c, instead of the correct (x + 4)^2 + c.
- When working with the quadratic equation x^2 + 4x - 3 = 0, a student might mistakenly rewrite it as (x + 4)^2 = 3 + 16, instead of (x + 2)^2 = 3 + 4."
104,Assumes a sequence is linear,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that any sequence or pattern they encounter will always increase or decrease by a constant difference, resulting in a straight line when graphed. They may overlook or misunderstand the concept of non-linear sequences, such as quadratic, exponential, or other types of sequences. As a result, they might incorrectly apply linear thinking to solve problems involving non-linear sequences, leading to incorrect conclusions or predictions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing the growth of a population, students might assume that the population grows by the same number of individuals each year, when in fact, the growth rate might be increasing or decreasing.
- When studying geometric sequences, students might mistakenly apply the formula for an arithmetic sequence to find the next term.
- When graphing data, students might incorrectly assume that the relationship between two variables is linear, even if the data suggests a non-linear relationship.
- When solving problems involving compound interest or exponential growth, students might assume that the growth is linear, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When analyzing real-world data, such as the growth of a company's revenue, students might assume that the growth is linear, when in fact, it might be influenced by various factors, resulting in non-linear growth."
105,Mixes up sides of a ratio,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of ratios and mistakenly swap or confuse the sides of a ratio. A ratio is a comparison of two quantities, often expressed as a fraction or using a colon (e.g., 3:4 or 3/4). Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify or write the ratio, switching the numerator and denominator or the numbers on either side of the colon.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying ratios: When simplifying ratios, students may mistakenly swap the sides, resulting in an incorrect simplified ratio.
2. Equivalent ratios: Students may confuse the sides of equivalent ratios, leading to incorrect equivalent ratios.
3. Ratio problems with missing values: When solving ratio problems with missing values, students may fill in the incorrect side of the ratio, leading to an incorrect solution.
4. Real-world applications: In real-world scenarios, such as cooking or measuring ingredients, students may confuse the sides of a ratio, resulting in incorrect proportions.
5. Word problems: When solving word problems involving ratios, students may misinterpret the problem and swap the sides of the ratio, leading to an incorrect answer."
106,Believes an arrowhead has four equal sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify an arrowhead, which is actually a type of quadrilateral known as a kite or sometimes seen as a type of triangle when joined with an additional line, as having four equal sides, similar to a square or rhombus. They may overlook the distinct characteristics of an arrowhead, which can have two pairs of adjacent sides of different lengths. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are introduced to various shapes in geometry and have difficulty distinguishing between different types of quadrilaterals.
- When students see an arrowhead shape with two pairs of sides that appear to be roughly equal, leading them to assume all sides are equal.
- When students have limited experience working with diverse shapes and may overgeneralize the properties of familiar shapes, such as squares, to less familiar shapes, like arrowheads.
- When students have difficulty visualizing and understanding the properties of different shapes, particularly those with less symmetry, such as arrowheads."
107,"When expanding brackets, multiplies out the first term correctly but adds together the number outside the bracket with the second term inside the bracket.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to expand brackets in algebra, specifically when dealing with expressions in the form of a(b + c). They understand that they need to multiply the term outside the bracket (a) with the first term inside the bracket (b), but incorrectly add the term outside the bracket (a) to the second term inside the bracket (c) instead of multiplying it.

For example, when expanding the expression 3(x + 4), students with this misconception would correctly multiply the 3 with the x to get 3x, but then add the 3 to the 4, resulting in 3x + 7 instead of the correct expansion 3x + 12.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Expanding 2(x + 5) to get 2x + 7 instead of 2x + 10
- Expanding 4(y + 3) to get 4y + 7 instead of 4y + 12
- Expanding 5(z + 2) to get 5z + 7 instead of 5z + 10"
108,Uses only the first two terms of a sequence to work out a term-to-term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that a sequence's pattern or rule can be determined by only examining the first two terms. They may look at the difference or relationship between the first two terms and assume that this relationship will hold true for the entire sequence, without checking subsequent terms to confirm the pattern. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the sequence's behavior and result in incorrect predictions or calculations of future terms.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A sequence starts with 2, 4, and the student assumes the rule is ""add 2"" without checking further terms.
- A sequence begins with 1, 3, and the student concludes the rule is ""add 2"" without considering other possibilities.
- A sequence starts with 5, 10, and the student assumes the rule is ""multiply by 2"" without examining additional terms to verify this pattern."
109,Thinks a factor of the final digit is also a factor of the whole number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that if a number is a factor of the last digit of a multi-digit number, it must also be a factor of the entire number. They may overlook the fact that factors are determined by the entire value of the number, not just its individual digits. This misconception may stem from an incomplete understanding of place value and the concept of factors.

For example, consider the following cases:

- Case 1: The number 12 has a final digit of 2, and 2 is indeed a factor of 12. However, students with this misconception might assume this pattern applies to all numbers.
- Case 2: The number 18 has a final digit of 8, and 2 is a factor of 8. Students may incorrectly assume that 18 must be divisible by all factors of 8, such as 4, simply because 4 is a factor of 8.
- Case 3: The number 25 has a final digit of 5, and 5 is indeed a factor of 25. Students might generalize this to other numbers, incorrectly assuming that any number ending in 5 is divisible by all factors of 5, without checking the entire number."
110,Does not know how to find the length of a line segment from coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to apply the distance formula to find the length of a line segment given the coordinates of its endpoints. They may struggle to recall the formula, plug in the correct values, or perform the necessary calculations. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of distance on a coordinate plane, or from insufficient practice in applying the formula.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the length of a side of a triangle or a rectangle on a coordinate plane.
- Calculating the distance between two points on a map or a graph.
- Determining the length of a line segment in a geometric shape, such as a diagonal of a square or a radius of a circle.
- Solving problems involving perimeter or area of shapes on a coordinate plane.
- Graphing and analyzing functions, such as finding the distance between two points on a function's graph."
111,Does not work out all possibilites when given an 'at least' question in probability,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with probability questions that involve the phrase 'at least'. In such cases, students tend to focus on the minimum requirement and fail to consider all possible outcomes that satisfy the condition. They may overlook the fact that 'at least' includes not just the minimum, but also all values greater than the minimum. As a result, they may not account for all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A coin is flipped 5 times. What is the probability of getting at least 3 heads?
- A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. What is the probability of drawing at least 2 red marbles in 3 draws?
- A die is rolled 4 times. What is the probability of rolling at least 2 sixes?"
112,Thinks the difference between the numerator and denominator determines how close the fraction is to 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the difference between the numerator and the denominator of a fraction is the determining factor in how close the fraction is to 1. They may think that as long as the difference between the numerator and denominator is small, the fraction is close to 1. For example, they might think that 9/10 is close to 1 because the difference between 9 and 10 is 1, but also think that 99/100 and 19/20 are equally close to 1 because the differences are both 1 and 1 respectively, and that 8/9 is not close to 1 because the difference is 1, which is the same as the difference in 9/10.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing fractions like 9/10 and 99/100, and thinking they are equally close to 1 because the difference between the numerator and denominator is 1 in both cases.
- Believing that 19/20 and 9/10 are equally close to 1 because the difference between the numerator and denominator is 1 in both cases.
- Thinking that 8/9 is not close to 1 because the difference between the numerator and denominator is 1, without considering the actual values of the numerator and denominator."
113,Does not recognise difference of two squares,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to identify the difference of two squares as a distinct algebraic identity. The difference of two squares is a fundamental concept in algebra, which states that a² - b² can be factored into (a + b)(a - b). Students with this misconception may not recognize this pattern and may attempt to expand or simplify the expression using incorrect methods.

This misconception can lead to errors when working with quadratic expressions, equations, and formulas. Students may struggle to factorize expressions, solve equations, or simplify complex algebraic expressions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions like x² - 4 or 9 - y², students may not recognize the difference of two squares and instead, try to expand or simplify using incorrect methods.
- When solving quadratic equations like x² - 16 = 0, students may not factorize the left-hand side as (x + 4)(x - 4) = 0, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with algebraic formulas, such as the area of a circle or the Pythagorean theorem, students may not recognize the difference of two squares and make errors in their calculations.
- When expanding or simplifying expressions like (x + 2)(x - 2), students may not recognize the difference of two squares and instead, try to use the distributive property or other incorrect methods."
114,Does not know the meaning of the word parallel,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the concept of parallel lines or have a limited understanding of the term ""parallel"". They may think that parallel lines are lines that are close together, touching, or even intersecting, rather than understanding that parallel lines are actually lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When drawing or identifying shapes, students may incorrectly label non-parallel lines as parallel.
* When working with geometry problems, students may assume that lines that appear to be close together or almost touching are parallel.
* When solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals, students may not understand the relationships between the angles formed and may incorrectly apply properties of parallel lines.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A student is asked to identify parallel lines in a diagram and incorrectly labels two intersecting lines as parallel.
* Case 2: A student is given a problem involving a transversal intersecting two lines and assumes that the lines are parallel because they appear to be close together.
* Case 3: A student is asked to draw a shape with parallel sides and draws two sides that intersect or meet at a point."
115,Believes fraction to decimal conversion is done by writing the numerator as a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a decimal involves simply writing the numerator as a decimal, without understanding the need to divide the numerator by the denominator. For example, they might think that 3/4 is equal to 3.0 or 3.4, rather than actually performing the division to get 0.75.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to decimal numbers and fractions, and they struggle to understand the relationship between the two.
- When students are asked to convert simple fractions to decimals, such as 1/2 or 3/4, and they rely on intuitive but incorrect methods.
- When students are faced with more complex fractions, such as 3/7 or 2/9, and they are unsure of how to perform the division to convert them to decimals.
- When students are working with real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or calculating proportions, and they need to convert fractions to decimals to perform calculations."
116,Believes an outlier is determined by the number of decimal places a number has,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that a data point is considered an outlier based on the number of decimal places it has, rather than its actual value in relation to the rest of the data set. For example, a student may think that a value with many decimal places (e.g., 12.4567) is an outlier simply because of its decimal places, regardless of whether its value is actually far away from the rest of the data.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with precise measurements, such as scientific data (e.g., temperature readings or pH levels), where students may incorrectly identify data points with more decimal places as outliers.
- When working with financial data, such as stock prices or currency exchange rates, where students may mistakenly think that a value with many decimal places is an outlier.
- When analyzing data from instruments or machines that provide readings with many decimal places (e.g., a digital scale or a micrometer), where students may incorrectly assume that the number of decimal places determines whether a value is an outlier."
117,"Believes that in completed square form, they need to change the signs of both values to get the turning point","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to find the turning point (also known as the vertex) of a quadratic function in the completed square form. They may incorrectly believe that to find the coordinates of the turning point, they need to change the signs of both the values inside the bracket and the value outside the bracket. 

For example, given the quadratic function in completed square form: y = (x + 3)^2 - 4, students with this misconception may think that the turning point is (-3, 4) instead of (-3, -4), changing the sign of the 4. Similarly, for y = (x - 2)^2 + 1, they might think the turning point is (2, -1) instead of (2, 1), again incorrectly changing the sign."
118,"Given a line segment with a midpoint that is not the origin, assumes that the two end points will still have the same absolute value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with the concept of a line segment with a midpoint at the origin (0,0) and its endpoints having the same absolute value but opposite signs (e.g., -3 and 3). However, they incorrectly generalize this concept to line segments with midpoints that are not at the origin.

For instance, if a line segment has a midpoint at (4, 0) and one endpoint at (1, 0), students with this misconception might assume that the other endpoint will be at (7, 0) because 1 and 7 have the same absolute difference from 4. However, they fail to recognize that the actual relationship between the endpoints is about being equidistant from the midpoint, not necessarily having the same absolute value.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. A line segment has a midpoint at (2, 3) and one endpoint at (0, 3). Students may think the other endpoint is at (4, 3) simply because 0 and 4 are equidistant from 2, without considering the actual midpoint coordinates.

2. A line segment has a midpoint at (5, -1) and one endpoint at (3, -1). Students may assume the other endpoint is at (7, -1) due to the same absolute difference, rather than verifying the midpoint formula.

3. A line segment has a midpoint at (-2, 4) and one endpoint at (-5, 4). Students may incorrectly determine the other endpoint to be at (1, 4) based on the misconception that endpoints must have the same absolute value."
119,Believes distance = speed + time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between distance, speed, and time. They incorrectly assume that adding speed and time together will give them the distance traveled. This error may stem from a lack of understanding of the correct formula, which is distance = speed × time (d = s × t), or a misunderstanding of the units and operations involved.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When calculating the distance traveled by an object moving at a constant speed, students may add the speed and time together, rather than multiplying them.
- When comparing distances traveled by different objects moving at different speeds, students may incorrectly assume that the object with the higher speed will travel a greater distance in the same time, without considering the actual calculation.
- When solving problems involving journey times and distances, students may use the incorrect formula, leading to inaccurate answers."
120,Does not understand equivalent fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend that equivalent fractions represent the same value or proportion, despite having different numerators and denominators. They may view fractions as distinct entities, failing to recognize that equivalent fractions can be simplified or transformed into each other by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same number.

For example, students may not understand that:

- 1/2 is equivalent to 2/4, 3/6, or 4/8
- 2/3 is equivalent to 4/6, 6/9, or 8/12

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- When comparing fractions: Students may incorrectly assume that 1/2 is less than 2/4 because the numbers appear smaller.
- When simplifying fractions: Students may not simplify 4/8 to 1/2, believing that the fractions are different.
- When adding or subtracting fractions: Students may struggle to find a common denominator, failing to recognize that equivalent fractions can be used to facilitate the calculation.
- When solving real-world problems: Students may misinterpret equivalent fractions in practical contexts, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza among friends."
121,Believes midpoint in grouped frequency table is found by multiplying midpoint by frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the midpoint in a grouped frequency table. They incorrectly assume that to find the midpoint, they need to multiply the midpoint of the class interval by the frequency of that class interval. This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of how to calculate the mean from a grouped frequency table, where students are required to multiply the midpoint by the frequency to find the total value for each class interval. However, they incorrectly apply this concept to finding the midpoint itself.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the midpoint of a class interval in a grouped frequency table, e.g., a student may think that if the class interval is 10-20 and the frequency is 5, the midpoint is (15) * 5.
- When calculating the mean from a grouped frequency table and the student incorrectly applies the multiplication of midpoint and frequency to find the midpoint itself.
- When dealing with unequal class intervals in a grouped frequency table, the student may incorrectly apply this concept, leading to incorrect midpoints."
122,Thinks they can convert percentages to fractions by writing the percentage value as both the numerator and the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a percentage to a fraction involves simply writing the percentage value as both the numerator and the denominator. For example, they might think that 25% can be written as 25/25, rather than understanding the correct relationship between percentages and fractions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to convert a percentage to a fraction, such as converting 50% to a fraction.
- When comparing percentages and fractions in real-life scenarios, such as calculating discounts or interest rates.
- When working with proportional relationships, such as scaling up or down, and students mistakenly apply this incorrect conversion method.
- When solving word problems that involve percentage changes, such as ""A shirt is on sale for 20% off its original price of $50.""
- When interpreting statistical data, such as understanding the proportion of a population that meets a certain criterion, and students incorrectly convert the percentage to a fraction."
123,Rounds incorrectly when the nearest 10 is a multiple of 100,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers to the nearest 10, but the number is close to a multiple of 100. For example, when rounding 99 to the nearest 10, some students may incorrectly round it to 100, thinking that since 100 is a ""big"" number, it's more correct to round to that. Similarly, when rounding 101 to the nearest 10, they might incorrectly round it to 100, not fully understanding the concept of rounding to the nearest 10.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Rounding 99 to the nearest 10, with the incorrect answer being 100.
- Rounding 101 to the nearest 10, with the incorrect answer being 100.
- Rounding 49 to the nearest 10, with the incorrect answer being 50 (if 50 is seen as a more significant number due to being half of 100).
- Rounding numbers like 990, 1010, etc., where the proximity to a multiple of 100 may cause confusion."
124,Believes perpendicular bisectors is the term used to describe two lines that are parallel,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of perpendicular bisectors and mistakenly associate it with parallel lines. They may think that the term 'perpendicular bisectors' refers to two lines that never intersect, rather than understanding that a perpendicular bisector is a line that passes through the midpoint of a segment and is perpendicular to it. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify and construct perpendicular bisectors in geometric problems.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify the perpendicular bisector of a line segment, they may draw a line that is parallel to the given segment instead of a line that intersects it at a 90-degree angle.
- When constructing the perpendicular bisector of a line segment using a compass and straightedge, students may draw a line that does not pass through the midpoint of the segment.
- When solving problems involving the properties of perpendicular bisectors, such as finding the midpoint of a line segment or determining the point of concurrency of multiple perpendicular bisectors, students may provide incorrect answers due to their misunderstanding of the concept."
125,Thinks the division sign means to add,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of division and believe that the division sign (/ or ÷) is actually an instruction to add. They might interpret the division operation as combining the numbers instead of sharing or grouping them. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of division and its relationship with other mathematical operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a number by a small number, such as 6 ÷ 2, the student might add 6 and 2, resulting in an answer of 8.
- When solving word problems that involve sharing, the student might add the numbers instead of dividing, e.g., ""If I have 12 cookies and I want to share them equally among 4 friends, how many cookies will each friend get?"" The student might answer 16 (12 + 4) instead of 3.
- When encountering division problems with multiple-digit numbers, such as 24 ÷ 4, the student might add the numbers, resulting in an incorrect answer of 28."
126,Multiplies rather than adds when given the command word 'more',"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the meaning of the command word 'more' in a mathematical context. When given a problem that involves finding a quantity that is a certain amount more than a given quantity, some students incorrectly assume that they need to multiply the original quantity by the additional amount instead of simply adding the two quantities together. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of basic addition concepts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A bookshelf has 5 books on it, and 3 more books are added. A student with this misconception might calculate the total number of books as 5 x 3 = 15 instead of 5 + 3 = 8.

2. Sarah has £8 in her piggy bank, and her grandmother gives her £2 more. A student with this misconception might calculate Sarah's new total as £8 x £2 = £16 instead of £8 + £2 = £10.

3. A bakery has 12 cupcakes on display, and they receive 4 more to add to the display. A student with this misconception might calculate the total number of cupcakes as 12 x 4 = 48 instead of 12 + 4 = 16."
127,Thinks the fraction to decimal conversion button on a calculator can be used to raise to a power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the fraction to decimal conversion button on a calculator (often denoted as a button with a box and a line or ""a/b"" and ""d/c"") serves a different function, specifically, raising a number to a power. They might think that the button can be used as a shortcut to calculate exponents or powers of numbers.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Simplifying expressions with exponents, such as 2^3. A student might enter 2 and then press the fraction to decimal conversion button with 3, expecting to get 8.
- Case 2: Solving problems involving exponential growth or decay. Students might attempt to use the fraction to decimal conversion button to calculate the result of raising a number to a power, leading to incorrect answers.
- Case 3: Converting between units with prefixes that involve exponents (e.g., converting between grams and kilograms). Students may try to use the fraction to decimal conversion button to simplify the conversion, resulting in incorrect calculations."
128,Does not understand how to read both x and y coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the concept of coordinates in a two-dimensional grid or graph. They may have difficulty identifying and reading both the x-coordinate (the horizontal axis) and the y-coordinate (the vertical axis) correctly. This can lead to incorrect plotting of points, misunderstanding of relationships between variables, and difficulty in interpreting graphs.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When asked to plot a point on a graph, a student might only look at the x-coordinate and ignore the y-coordinate, or vice versa.
- When given a set of coordinates (e.g., (3,4)), a student might confuse the order of the coordinates and think that the point is located at (4,3) instead.
- When reading a graph, a student might have trouble identifying the x and y intercepts, or understanding how the coordinates relate to the graph's axes.
- When working with real-world applications, such as mapping or navigation, a student might struggle to understand how to use coordinates to locate a point on a map or grid.
- When solving problems involving linear equations, a student might have difficulty graphing the equation on a coordinate plane due to their inability to read both x and y coordinates correctly."
129,Believes they can change only one side of a ratio and it will remain equivalent,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that ratios represent a proportional relationship between two quantities. They mistakenly believe that altering one side of the ratio (either the numerator or the denominator) will still maintain the equivalence, without realizing that this disrupts the proportionality. 

For instance, if a recipe requires a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 1 cup of sugar, students with this misconception may think that if they increase the amount of flour to 4 cups, they can keep the amount of sugar at 1 cup, not understanding that the amount of sugar should also be doubled to maintain the ratio. 

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Scaling up or down a recipe: When students are asked to adjust the quantities of ingredients for a larger or smaller batch, they might only change one side of the ratio, resulting in an incorrect proportion.
- Equivalent fractions: When simplifying fractions or finding equivalent fractions, students may alter only the numerator or denominator, leading to an incorrect equivalent fraction.
- Real-world applications: In real-world problems, such as building design, medicine, or finance, students may be required to work with ratios and proportions. If they hold this misconception, they may make critical errors in their calculations and conclusions."
130,"Believes that for a line written in the form ax + by = c, a is the gradient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify the coefficient 'a' in the equation ax + by = c as the gradient of the line. They may think that 'a' represents how steep the line is, which is actually the role of the gradient. In the equation ax + by = c, 'a' is actually the coefficient of x and plays a different role in defining the line. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the standard form of a linear equation and the role of its coefficients.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When students are given an equation like 2x + 3y = 5 and asked to find the gradient, they may incorrectly answer '2'.
- When students are asked to write an equation of a line with a specific gradient, they may place the gradient value as the coefficient 'a'.
- When students are graphing lines and need to identify the gradient from the equation, they may use the value of 'a' instead of calculating the actual gradient."
131,Does not think a number can be a factor of itself,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of the concept of factors. They might believe that a factor is only a number that divides another number without a remainder, but it must be a different number. They fail to recognize that every number can be divided by itself without leaving a remainder, making it a factor of itself. For example, the factors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6, but students with this misconception may exclude 6 as a factor.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When listing factors of a number, students may not include the number itself.
- When asked to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two or more numbers, students may not consider the numbers themselves as potential GCFs.
- When solving problems involving the concept of factors, such as determining the number of possible rectangles that can be formed with a given area, students may overlook the possibility of using the number itself as a factor.
- When working with prime numbers, students may struggle to understand that a prime number has only two distinct factors, 1 and itself, because they don't consider the number itself as a factor."
132,Only considers the positive solution when calculating a square root,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of square roots, but they fail to understand that every positive number has two square roots, one positive and one negative. They tend to only consider the positive solution, neglecting the negative counterpart. This limited understanding can be attributed to the initial focus on positive numbers when square roots are first introduced, or the emphasis on finding the principal (positive) square root in many mathematical operations.

This misconception can manifest in various mathematical contexts, including:

- Simplifying square roots of perfect squares (e.g., √16 = ?)
- Solving quadratic equations (e.g., x² = 25)
- Working with algebraic expressions (e.g., √(x²) = ?)
- Analyzing functions involving square roots (e.g., f(x) = √x)

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A student is asked to find the square root of 9, and they respond with only √9 = 3, neglecting the negative solution, -3.

2. When solving the quadratic equation x² = 16, a student may only consider the positive solution, x = 4, and overlook the negative solution, x = -4.

3. In simplifying the expression √(x²), a student may write it as x, forgetting that the result could also be -x, depending on the value of x."
133,Believes dividing by a unit fraction is equivalent to dividing by its reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that dividing by a unit fraction (a fraction with a numerator of 1, e.g. 1/2, 1/3) is the same as dividing by its reciprocal (i.e. the fraction flipped, e.g. 2/1, 3/1). They may think that since the reciprocal is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator, dividing by the unit fraction is the same as dividing by its ""flipped"" version.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying expressions involving division by unit fractions, e.g. 6 ÷ 1/2
- When solving problems involving ratios or proportions with unit fractions, e.g. ""A recipe requires 1/4 cup of sugar. If you want to make half the recipe, how much sugar do you need?""
- When dealing with word problems that involve dividing quantities by unit fractions, e.g. ""A bookshelf has 12 shelves, and 1/3 of them are filled. How many shelves are filled?""
- When working with algebraic expressions involving division by unit fractions, e.g. (x + 2) ÷ 1/3."
134,Misreads scale,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty accurately interpreting the scale or units of measurement on graphs, charts, or measuring instruments, such as rulers or measuring tapes. They may misread the markings, confuse the units of measurement, or have trouble understanding the relationship between the scale and the actual quantity being measured.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Reading a graph with an unusual scale: A student is presented with a graph that has a non-standard scale (e.g., 1 cm represents 5 units) and misinterprets the data because they assume a standard scale (e.g., 1 cm represents 1 unit).

2. Measuring length with a ruler: A student is asked to measure the length of an object using a ruler with metric units on one side and imperial units on the other, and they mistakenly read the wrong units or scale.

3. Interpreting a map with a scale: A student is given a map with a scale of 1:1000 and mistakenly thinks that 1 cm on the map represents 1 km in real life, rather than 1000 meters.

4. Reading a chart with multiple scales: A student is presented with a chart that has multiple scales (e.g., temperature and humidity) and gets confused about which scale corresponds to which data set.

5. Using a measuring tape with different units: A student is using a measuring tape that has both metric and imperial units marked on it, but they are not familiar with one of the units, leading to misreading the measurement."
135,Thinks the value of an exterior angle is 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the exterior angles of a polygon and the total sum of degrees in a circle. They may recall that a circle has 360 degrees and incorrectly assume that each exterior angle of a polygon is also 360 degrees, rather than understanding that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the measure of an exterior angle of a regular polygon.
- When students are asked to find the sum of the exterior angles of different polygons.
- When students are solving problems involving the relationship between interior and exterior angles of polygons.
- When students are working with real-world applications, such as architecture or design, where understanding exterior angles is crucial."
136,Does not recognise a reciprocal equation,"Explanation: A student with this misconception may struggle to identify and work with equations that involve reciprocals, which are equations where the variable (or unknown value) is in the denominator of a fraction, often in the form of 1/x or x^-1. This can lead to difficulties in manipulating and solving these types of equations, as the student may not recognize the reciprocal relationship between the variable and its inverse.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When simplifying expressions involving reciprocals, e.g., 1/x + 1/x = ?
* When solving equations with reciprocals, e.g., 1/x = 2 or 2/x = 3
* When graphing reciprocal functions, e.g., y = 1/x or y = 2/x
* When working with proportions and ratios, e.g., x/2 = 3 or 2/x = 5
* When solving problems involving rates and rates of change, e.g., distance/speed = time or speed/distance = rate."
137,Does not know the meaning of the word identity ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of identity in mathematics, particularly in algebra. They may not fully comprehend that an identity is an equation that is true for all values of the variable(s) involved. The students might view identities as ordinary equations that can be solved to find a specific value for the variable, rather than understanding that identities are statements of equivalence that hold true regardless of the value of the variable.

For instance, when presented with the identity a + 0 = a, students with this misconception may think that the equation is asking for the value of 'a', rather than recognizing that it is a statement about the additive identity property of zero, which applies to all values of 'a'.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions and the student does not recognize that certain expressions are equivalent due to an underlying identity (e.g., a + -a = 0).
- When solving equations and the student mistakenly tries to ""solve"" an identity as if it were a regular equation (e.g., 2x = 2x).
- When exploring properties of operations and the student fails to recognize the role of identities in demonstrating these properties (e.g., the distributive property: a(b + c) = ab + ac).
- When working with trigonometric identities and the student does not understand that these identities are true for all values of the angle(s) involved (e.g., sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1)."
138,"When solving a problem using written division (bus-stop method), does the calculation from right to left","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the bus-stop method of written division. They mistakenly assume that the calculation should be performed from right to left, possibly due to the placement of the dividend (the number being divided) and the divisor (the number by which we are dividing) in the bus-stop layout. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that the dividend is written on the top line and the divisor is written on the left, leading students to believe that the calculation should start from the rightmost digit of the dividend and proceed leftward.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a multi-digit number by a single-digit number (e.g., 432 ÷ 6).
- When dividing a multi-digit number by a multi-digit number (e.g., 432 ÷ 12).
- When the dividend has a remainder, and the student is unsure how to handle it in the written division process.
- When the divisor is larger than the first digit of the dividend, requiring the student to regroup or ""borrow"" from the next digit."
139,Thinks triple means add three,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term ""triple"" as an instruction to add 3 to a given number, rather than understanding it as a multiplication operation that means ""three times as much."" In other words, students mistakenly believe that to triple a number, they simply need to add 3 to it, rather than multiplying it by 3.

Examples of when this misconception may occur:

- When a recipe calls for a ingredient to be tripled, a student might add 3 units of that ingredient instead of multiplying it by 3.
- In a math problem, if a student is asked to triple a number, such as triple 5, they might respond with 5 + 3 = 8 instead of the correct answer, 5 * 3 = 15.
- When comparing quantities, a student might think that tripling a quantity means adding 3 more, rather than understanding that it means the quantity is now three times as large."
140,Believes cumulative frequency is plotted at the lower bound of the class,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that when constructing a cumulative frequency graph, the cumulative frequency should be plotted at the lower bound of each class interval. They may think that since the lower bound is the starting point of the interval, it's where the cumulative frequency should be represented. However, this understanding neglects the fact that cumulative frequency represents the total count up to a certain point, and plotting at the lower bound doesn't accurately reflect this.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are constructing a cumulative frequency graph for the first time and are unsure where to plot the points.
- When dealing with class intervals that are not of equal width, leading to confusion about where the cumulative frequency should be plotted.
- When working with real-life data, such as exam scores or measurements, where class intervals may have different bounds and the student is unsure how to accurately plot the cumulative frequency."
141,"In completed square form, confuses the x and y coordinates of the turning point","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with quadratic equations in the form of completed squares, typically in the format of y = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) represents the coordinates of the turning point (also known as the vertex) of the parabola. 

Students with this misconception tend to swap or confuse the roles of 'h' and 'k', which represent the x and y coordinates of the turning point respectively. This means that when asked to identify the coordinates of the turning point, they may incorrectly state them as (k, h) instead of the correct (h, k).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
1. When students are asked to find the coordinates of the turning point of a parabola given the equation in completed square form.
2. When students are required to graph a quadratic equation in completed square form and label the turning point.
3. When students need to determine the effect of changes in 'h' and 'k' on the position of the parabola's turning point."
142,"When given a linear sequence, cannot match it to a visual pattern","Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to connect a linear sequence, which is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term, to a visual representation or pattern. They may be able to identify the sequence as linear but fail to associate it with a corresponding visual pattern, such as a series of blocks or dots that increase by a fixed amount.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When presented with a sequence like 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and asked to create a visual pattern using blocks or other materials to represent the sequence.
- When given a visual pattern of a series of dots or blocks that increase by a fixed amount and asked to write the corresponding linear sequence.
- When attempting to extend a visual pattern to predict the next term in a linear sequence.
- When trying to identify the relationship between a linear sequence and a real-world scenario, such as the number of legs on a series of tables with increasing numbers of chairs."
143,"Thinks that when you cancel identical terms from the numerator and denominator, they just disappear","Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that canceling identical terms from the numerator and denominator of a fraction means that those terms simply vanish. They fail to understand that when canceling, they are essentially dividing both the numerator and denominator by the same value, which changes the fraction's form but not its value. 

For example, when simplifying the fraction 6/8, students might think that canceling the 2s means they just disappear, without realizing that they are actually dividing both the numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in 3/4.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Simplifying fractions: 4/6 = ? (students might think the 2s just disappear, rather than understanding that they are dividing both numbers by 2)
- Canceling common factors in algebraic expressions: (2x)/(4x) = ? (students might think the x's just disappear, rather than understanding that they are dividing both terms by x)
- Reducing ratios: 8:12 = ? (students might think the 4s just disappear, rather than understanding that they are dividing both numbers by 4)"
144,Mixes up the x and y values of the coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate of a point on a graph. They may incorrectly identify or plot points, swapping the values of the x and y coordinates. This can lead to errors in graphing functions, identifying patterns, and interpreting data.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to plot points on a graph, they may mistakenly write the y-coordinate first and the x-coordinate second, resulting in an incorrect plot.
- When identifying the coordinates of a point on a graph, students may confuse the x and y values, leading to incorrect answers.
- When working with functions, such as linear equations, students may swap the x and y values, resulting in incorrect graphs or equations.
- When solving problems involving coordinate geometry, such as finding the midpoint or distance between two points, students may mix up the x and y coordinates, leading to incorrect calculations."
145,Does not know how to convert percentages with a decimal point into decimals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to convert percentages that include a decimal point into decimals. They may struggle to understand that the percentage sign (%) represents ""out of 100"" and that the decimal point in the percentage needs to be taken into account when converting it to a decimal. 

For example, students may incorrectly convert 45.5% to 0.4550 or 455 instead of 0.455. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of place value or a misunderstanding of how to apply the conversion rule.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:
- Converting interest rates: A savings account has an interest rate of 4.25%. What is this as a decimal?
- Calculating discounts: A shirt is on sale for 15.5% off. What is this discount as a decimal?
- Understanding statistics: A survey shows that 22.8% of respondents preferred a certain brand. What is this percentage as a decimal?
- Solving algebra problems: An equation involves a percentage with a decimal point that needs to be converted to a decimal to solve for the variable."
146,Has multiplied by the root power,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when a number or variable with an exponent is multiplied by itself, the exponents should be multiplied instead of added. Specifically, they may think that (a^m) * (a^n) equals a^(m*n) instead of the correct a^(m+n). This misunderstanding can be observed in various algebraic operations, such as simplifying expressions or solving equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: (2^3) * (2^4) = 2^(3*4) instead of 2^(3+4).
2. Solving equations: (x^2) * (x^3) = x^(2*3) instead of x^(2+3).
3. Exponential growth and decay: (3^2) * (3^5) = 3^(2*5) instead of 3^(2+5).
4. Manipulating algebraic expressions: (a^2) * (a^b) = a^(2*b) instead of a^(2+b).
5. Radicals and exponents: (√x) * (√x) = x^(1/2 * 1/2) instead of x^(1/2 + 1/2)."
147,Multiplies instead of dividing when distributing a total amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when distributing or sharing a total amount into equal parts, they need to multiply the total amount by the number of parts, rather than dividing it. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations, often resulting in answers that are much larger than the original amount.

For example:

* Case 1: A pizza is cut into 8 slices, and a student is asked to find out how much pizza each person gets if 16 people share 4 pizzas. The student may multiply 4 pizzas by 8 slices and then again by 16 people, rather than dividing the total number of slices by 16.
* Case 2: A group of friends want to share some candy equally. If they have 48 pieces of candy and there are 8 friends, a student may multiply 48 by 8, thinking that each friend gets 384 pieces, instead of dividing 48 by 8 to get 6 pieces per friend.
* Case 3: A bakery has 18 cakes to be packed into boxes of 3 cakes each. A student may multiply 18 cakes by 3, thinking that they need 54 boxes, instead of dividing 18 by 3 to get 6 boxes."
148,Confuses theoretical and experimental probability,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between theoretical probability, which is the likelihood of an event happening based on the number of possible outcomes, and experimental probability, which is the actual outcome of repeated trials or experiments. Students may mistakenly assume that the results of a few trials or experiments will always match the theoretical probability, or vice versa. They may also believe that experimental probability is more reliable or accurate than theoretical probability, or that a small number of trials is sufficient to accurately determine the probability of an event.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* A student flips a coin 5 times and gets heads each time, then concludes that the probability of getting heads is 100%.
* A student rolls a die 10 times and gets a 6 three times, then assumes that the probability of rolling a 6 is 30%.
* A student believes that because a fair coin has a theoretical probability of 50% heads and 50% tails, they will always get exactly 5 heads and 5 tails when flipping a coin 10 times.
* A student thinks that if they conduct an experiment and get a result that differs from the theoretical probability, the theoretical probability must be incorrect.
* A student assumes that the more trials they conduct, the closer the experimental probability will get to 100% or 0%, rather than understanding that it will approach the theoretical probability."
149,Believes P(success) in probability notation means the number of successes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of probability notation, specifically P(success). They incorrectly assume that P(success) represents the number of successful outcomes, rather than the probability of a successful outcome occurring. In probability notation, P(success) actually represents the ratio of the number of successful outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the probability of a coin landing on heads, a student may write P(heads) = 1, thinking that it represents the number of heads, rather than the probability of getting heads, which is actually 1/2.
- In a scenario where a student is asked to find the probability of drawing a specific card from a deck, they may write P(Ace of Spades) = 1, thinking that it represents the number of Aces of Spades, rather than the probability of drawing the Ace of Spades, which is actually 1/52.
- When analyzing the results of a survey, a student may write P(students who like pizza) = 25, thinking that it represents the number of students who like pizza, rather than the probability of a student liking pizza, which would be 25/total number of students surveyed."
150,Confuses written 'teen' numbers with their corresponding single-digit number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly associate written 'teen' numbers (e.g., thirteen, fourteen, fifteen) with their corresponding single-digit number (e.g., 3, 4, 5). This is likely due to the way the numbers are written and sounded out. For example, 'thirteen' contains the word 'three', which may lead students to incorrectly associate it with the single-digit number 3.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are reading or writing numbers in words, especially in the teens.
- When comparing or ordering numbers, students may incorrectly place 'teen' numbers based on their corresponding single-digit number.
- When performing arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, students may confuse the value of 'teen' numbers with their single-digit counterparts.
- When counting or identifying patterns, students may mistakenly skip or repeat 'teen' numbers due to their incorrect association with single-digit numbers."
151,"When dividing decimals, does not realize that the order and position of the digits (relative to each other) has to remain constant.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing decimals and they incorrectly move or alter the digits of the dividend or divisor without maintaining their relative positions. They might move the decimal point in the dividend or divisor without properly adjusting the other, resulting in an incorrect calculation. 

This misconception often stems from a lack of understanding of place value and how decimal points affect the value of numbers. Students might treat the digits before and after the decimal point as separate entities, rather than understanding that they represent a single quantity.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Dividing 12.5 by 2, a student might move the decimal point in 12.5 to make it 125 and then divide by 2, without adjusting the decimal point in the quotient.
- When dividing 4.8 by 0.6, a student might ignore the decimal points and divide 48 by 6, without considering the place value of the digits.
- Dividing 9.25 by 3, a student might separate the whole number part (9) and the decimal part (0.25) and perform separate divisions, losing the relative position of the digits."
152,"Believes that the smaller a divisor is, the smaller the answer will be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that there is a direct relationship between the size of the divisor and the size of the quotient. They believe that if they divide a number by a smaller divisor, the result will be smaller, and if they divide by a larger divisor, the result will be larger. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and estimations in division problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A student is asked to divide 24 by 2 and then by 4. They might assume that dividing by 2 will result in a smaller answer than dividing by 4, simply because 2 is smaller than 4.
* Case 2: A student is comparing the division problems 48 ÷ 6 and 48 ÷ 3. They might incorrectly assume that 48 ÷ 3 will result in a smaller answer because 3 is smaller than 6.
* Case 3: A student is solving a word problem that involves sharing a certain quantity of items among a group of people. They might assume that if they divide the items among a smaller group, each person will receive fewer items, simply because the group size is smaller."
153,"When dividing decimals with the same number of decimal places as each other, assumes the answer also has the same number of decimal places","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing decimals and mistakenly believe that the number of decimal places in the quotient (result) will be the same as the number of decimal places in the dividend and divisor. For example, if they are dividing 2.5 by 0.5, they may assume that the answer will also have one decimal place, simply because both numbers have one decimal place. 

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- 4.2 ÷ 0.6 = ? (assuming the answer must have one decimal place)
- 2.4 ÷ 0.8 = ? (assuming the answer must have one decimal place)
- 12.8 ÷ 4.2 = ? (assuming the answer must have one decimal place)

In each of these cases, the student may incorrectly assume that the answer will have the same number of decimal places as the dividend and divisor, rather than considering the actual calculation and the correct placement of the decimal point in the quotient."
154,Assumes an angle has been split into equal parts,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that an angle has been divided into equal parts, simply because lines or rays are drawn within it. They may overlook the actual measurements or proportions of the divided angle, leading to incorrect assumptions about its parts being congruent.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When a diagram shows an angle with multiple lines or rays drawn within it, but no explicit information about the angle measurements is given.
2. In problems involving the division of an angle into smaller parts, where students may assume equal parts without checking the actual measurements or ratios.
3. When working with geometric shapes, such as triangles or polygons, where students may incorrectly assume that all internal angles are divided into equal parts.
4. In construction or drawing activities, where students may draw lines or rays within an angle without considering the actual proportions or measurements of the divided parts.
5. When solving problems involving angle bisectors or other types of angle divisions, where students may mistakenly assume equal parts without verifying the information."
155,Forgets to apply inverse trigonometric function when finding an angle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with trigonometric ratios to find an angle in a right-angled triangle. They may correctly use the sine, cosine, or tangent ratio to set up an equation, but then forget to apply the inverse trigonometric function (e.g. sin^-1, cos^-1, tan^-1) to solve for the angle. Instead, they may try to solve for the angle by simply dividing or multiplying both sides of the equation by a trigonometric ratio, or they may leave the equation in terms of the trigonometric ratio without taking the inverse.

This misconception can lead to incorrect solutions, as the student is not properly ""reversing"" the trigonometric function to find the angle.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A student is given the equation sin(x) = 0.5 and tries to solve for x by dividing both sides by sin, rather than using the inverse sine function.
* A student is working on a problem involving a right triangle and correctly sets up the equation tan(x) = 3/4, but then tries to solve for x by multiplying both sides by 4/3, rather than using the inverse tangent function.
* A student is using a calculator to solve a trigonometric equation and forgets to use the inverse trigonometric function key (e.g. sin^-1), leading to an incorrect solution."
156,Confuses the graph of a linear equation with a quadratic equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to distinguish between the graphical representations of linear and quadratic equations. They may incorrectly identify a linear equation's graph as a quadratic equation's graph or vice versa. This often occurs when students are not familiar with the distinct characteristics of each type of equation's graph. For linear equations, the graph is a straight line, whereas, for quadratic equations, the graph is a parabola (U-shaped curve).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When graphing the equation y = 2x, a student may incorrectly draw a parabola instead of a straight line, thinking it's a quadratic equation.
2. When given the equation y = x^2, a student may incorrectly graph a straight line instead of a parabola, thinking it's a linear equation.
3. When asked to identify the type of equation represented by a graph, a student may mistake a linear equation's graph for a quadratic equation's graph, or vice versa, due to a lack of understanding of the distinct characteristics of each type of equation's graph."
157,Believes squared units can be used to measure lengths,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between units used for measuring lengths and those used for measuring areas. They may think that squared units, such as square meters (m²), square centimeters (cm²), or square inches (in²), can be used to express lengths. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that both length and area measurements involve numerical values and units, but students may not fully grasp the fundamental difference between the two concepts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the perimeter of a rectangle, a student may incorrectly express the answer in squared units, e.g., ""The perimeter of the rectangle is 20 cm².""
- When measuring the length of a room, a student may say, ""The room is 12 m² long.""
- When solving a problem that involves converting between units, a student may mistakenly convert length units to squared units, e.g., ""1 kilometer is equal to 1,000,000 m².""
- When comparing the lengths of different objects, a student may incorrectly use squared units to describe the difference, e.g., ""The first object is 5 cm² longer than the second object."""
158,"Believes addition comes before indices, in orders of operation","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). In this case, students mistakenly believe that addition should be performed before indices (exponents). This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and results in various mathematical expressions.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Evaluating expressions like 2 + 3^2, where students may incorrectly add 2 and 3 first, then square the result.
- Simplifying expressions like 5 + 2^3 - 1, where students may perform the addition and subtraction before evaluating the exponent.
- Solving equations like 2 + x^2 = 10, where students may incorrectly add 2 to x before squaring x."
159,Does not divide by 2 when calculating the area of a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a triangle and they forget or misunderstand the importance of dividing the product of the base and height by 2. The students may simply multiply the base and height together, resulting in an area that is twice the actual size. This error demonstrates a lack of understanding of the formula for the area of a triangle, which is A = (base × height) / 2.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are given the base and height of a triangle and asked to calculate the area, they might write A = base × height, ignoring the division by 2.
- In real-world applications, such as calculating the area of a triangular garden or a roof, students may make this mistake, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially costly errors.
- When solving problems involving the comparison of areas of different shapes, including triangles, students with this misconception may make incorrect comparisons and arrive at wrong conclusions.
- In more complex geometric calculations, such as finding the area of a composite shape that includes triangles, this misconception can lead to a series of errors and an incorrect final answer."
160,Believes that adding a positive to a negative makes your answer more negative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the concept of negative numbers and how they interact with positive numbers. They may view negative numbers as simply being ""opposite"" to positive numbers, without fully grasping the concept of the number line and how numbers can be added and subtracted. As a result, when adding a positive number to a negative number, they may assume that the positive number will somehow ""enhance"" the negativity of the negative number, making the answer even more negative.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When adding a small positive number to a large negative number (e.g., -10 + 2 = ?)
* When dealing with word problems that involve temperatures or financial transactions (e.g., ""The temperature dropped to -5°C and then rose by 3°C. What is the new temperature?"")
* When working with simple arithmetic operations involving negative numbers (e.g., -3 + 1 = ?)
* When solving algebraic equations that involve negative numbers (e.g., x - 2 = -5, solve for x)"
161,Answers as if there are 100 minutes in an hour when changing from hours to minutes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 minutes in an hour instead of 60 minutes. As a result, when converting hours to minutes, they may multiply the number of hours by 100 instead of 60, leading to incorrect calculations. 

This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between hours and minutes or an overgeneralization of the concept of percentages or proportions, where 100 is a common reference point.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A recipe requires 2 hours of cooking time. If a student is asked to convert this to minutes, they may answer 200 minutes (2 x 100) instead of 120 minutes (2 x 60).
- Case 2: A bus travels for 3 hours and 15 minutes. If a student is asked to convert this to just minutes, they may answer 315 minutes (3 x 100 + 15) instead of 195 minutes (3 x 60 + 15).
- Case 3: A person runs for 1.5 hours a day. If a student is asked to convert this to minutes, they may answer 150 minutes (1.5 x 100) instead of 90 minutes (1.5 x 60)."
162,Uses first term as numerical part of nth term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly assume that the first term of a sequence or pattern is the fixed numerical part of the nth term rule. They tend to ignore the fact that the first term is actually the result of substituting n=1 into the general rule, rather than being a constant that is added to the formula.

For example, in the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, ..., students may incorrectly assume that the nth term rule is something like ""5 + 3n"" because the first term is 5 and the sequence increases by 3 each time. They fail to recognize that the correct rule would be formed by analyzing the pattern and relationship between the terms, rather than just adding the first term as a constant.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When finding the nth term rule of an arithmetic sequence, students may incorrectly use the first term as the numerical part of the rule.
* In a geometric sequence, students may mistakenly assume that the first term is the fixed numerical part, rather than recognizing it as the result of substituting n=1 into the general rule.
* When analyzing a pattern or sequence, students may incorrectly identify the first term as the fixed starting point, rather than recognizing it as part of the overall pattern or sequence."
163,Thinks only one variable can introduce bias,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that only a single variable or factor can introduce bias in a statistical analysis or experiment. They may think that as long as they control for one variable, their results will be accurate and unbiased. However, in reality, multiple variables can contribute to bias, and ignoring these variables can lead to flawed conclusions.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Case 1: In an experiment to measure the effect of fertilizer on plant growth, a student may control for the amount of water given to each plant but ignore other variables like sunlight, soil type, and temperature, which can also affect plant growth.
- Case 2: When analyzing the relationship between the amount of exercise and weight loss, a student may account for the duration of exercise but neglect other factors like diet, age, and genetics, which can also influence weight loss.
- Case 3: In a survey to determine the favorite food among students, a student may control for age but overlook other variables like cultural background, socioeconomic status, and personal preferences, which can also affect the outcome."
164,Does not reduce the denominator when an item is not replaced in a probability question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating probabilities in situations where an item is not replaced after being selected. They tend to use the original total number of items as the denominator for subsequent calculations, instead of reducing the total by the number of items already selected. 

For example, this misconception might occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is asked to find the probability of drawing two specific cards from a deck without replacement. They may incorrectly use the original total number of cards (52) as the denominator for the second draw, instead of using 51 (since one card has already been removed).
- Case 2: In a problem where marbles are being drawn from a bag without replacement, a student may continue to use the original total number of marbles as the denominator, even after several marbles have been removed.
- Case 3: A student is asked to calculate the probability of selecting two specific balls from a basket without replacement. They may incorrectly use the original total number of balls as the denominator for the second selection, instead of accounting for the fact that one ball has already been removed."
165,"Believes that in y=mx+c, m is the x-intercept","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the components of the linear equation y = mx + c. They mistakenly believe that 'm' represents the x-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. In reality, 'm' represents the slope or gradient of the line, indicating how steep it is. The x-intercept is actually the point where y = 0, and it is related to the value of 'c' when the equation is in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + c).

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the x-intercept of a line and they provide the value of 'm' instead of solving for 'c' or using the x-intercept formula.
- When graphing a linear equation, students may plot the point (m, 0) as the x-intercept instead of finding the correct x-intercept.
- When comparing the steepness of two lines, students may incorrectly compare the x-intercepts instead of comparing the values of 'm'.
- When solving problems involving linear equations, students may substitute 'm' into the equation as if it were the x-intercept, leading to incorrect solutions."
166,"Believes that in completed square form, they need to change the sign of the constant to get the turning point","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning about quadratic equations and the method of completing the square to find the vertex or turning point of a parabola. They may misunderstand the process of completing the square and believe that to find the turning point, they need to change the sign of the constant term in the completed square form. This means that if the completed square form is (x + a)^2 + b, they would incorrectly think that the turning point is at (-a, -b) instead of (-a, b). 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the vertex of a parabola in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c by completing the square.
- When determining the minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function.
- When graphing a quadratic equation and labeling the turning point.
- When solving problems involving the vertex form of a parabola, y = a(x-h)^2 + k, and incorrectly applying the misconception to find the values of h and k."
167,Does not recognise factorising a quadratic,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that factorising a quadratic expression involves finding two binomial expressions that multiply to give the original quadratic. They may not be able to identify the correct factors or may not be aware of the need to find factors that multiply to the constant term and add to the coefficient of the middle term.

This misconception can arise due to a lack of understanding of the concept of factoring, or because students have not had enough practice in factoring quadratic expressions. They may also be using incorrect methods, such as trying to factor the expression by simply finding the square root of the constant term, or by only factoring the quadratic expression into its linear factors without considering the coefficient of the middle term.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to factorise a quadratic expression such as x^2 + 5x + 6, a student with this misconception may write x(x + 6) instead of (x + 2)(x + 3).
- When trying to solve a quadratic equation such as x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0, a student with this misconception may try to find the square root of 4 and then add or subtract 4 to solve for x, instead of factoring the expression as (x + 2)(x + 2) = 0.
- When simplifying a rational expression such as (x^2 + 3x + 2) / (x + 1), a student with this misconception may not be able to factor the numerator as (x + 1)(x + 2) and cancel out the common factor (x + 1)."
168,Believes composite function notation means to substitute the outer function into the inner function,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to composite function notation, often denoted as f(g(x)) or (f ∘ g)(x). They mistakenly believe that the outer function, f, should be substituted into the inner function, g. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect function compositions and ultimately, wrong solutions.

In the case of composite functions, students may think that the order of the functions can be swapped. They may also incorrectly apply the substitution, which can alter the final result.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Given f(x) = 2x and g(x) = x^2, find f(g(x)). Students may mistakenly substitute f(x) into g(x), resulting in an incorrect function.
2. When composing multiple functions, such as f(g(h(x))), students may incorrectly substitute the outermost function, f, into the innermost function, h.
3. When dealing with more complex functions, such as trigonometric functions or rational functions, students may become confused about which function to substitute and in what order."
169,"When subtracting a fraction from a mixed number, assumes they just subtract the numerator from the integer of the mixed number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully understanding the concept of mixed numbers and fractions. They tend to treat the integer part of the mixed number as the only part that matters, forgetting that the fraction part also has a value. When subtracting a fraction from a mixed number, they might simply subtract the numerator of the fraction from the integer part of the mixed number, ignoring the denominator and the fractional part of the mixed number.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- 5 1/2 - 1/2: The student might simply subtract 1 from 5, resulting in 4, instead of considering the fraction parts.
- 3 1/4 - 3/4: The student might subtract 3 from 3, resulting in 0, and ignore the fraction parts.
- 2 3/4 - 1/4: The student might subtract 1 from 2, resulting in 1, without considering the fraction parts.

This misconception shows a lack of understanding of how to work with mixed numbers and fractions, and how to perform subtraction operations involving these types of numbers."
170,Does not understand that when dividing both sides of an equation by an amount every term must be divided by the same amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that when dividing both sides of an equation by a certain value, every term on both sides must be divided by that same value to maintain the equation's balance. Students may mistakenly think that they only need to divide one term or a few select terms by the given value, rather than applying the division operation uniformly across all terms.

This misconception can lead to incorrect simplification of equations and ultimately, wrong solutions. It stems from a lack of understanding of the fundamental principle of equivalence in equations, where whatever operation is applied to one side of the equation, the same operation must be applied to the other side to maintain the equality.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: When solving linear equations, a student may divide the constant term by a coefficient, but forget to divide the variable term by the same coefficient.
- Case 2: In an equation with multiple terms on one side, a student might divide only one term by a given value, neglecting to divide the other terms on the same side.
- Case 3: When working with algebraic expressions involving fractions, a student may incorrectly simplify the expression by only dividing certain terms by a common denominator, rather than dividing all terms by the same denominator."
171,"When simplifying surds, does not multiply the number in front of the surd with the square root of the largest square number that has been removed from the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying surds and they correctly identify the largest square number that can be removed from the surd, but they forget to multiply the number in front of the surd with the square root of that largest square number.

For example, when simplifying the surd 3√24, students may correctly identify that 4 is the largest square number that can be removed from 24, and they rewrite the surd as 3√(4*6), but then they may incorrectly simplify it as 3√4 * √6 = 3√6, forgetting to multiply the 3 with the square root of 4, which is 2.

Some short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Simplifying 2√50 as 2√2, instead of 2*√25 * √2 = 10√2
- Simplifying 5√72 as 5√8, instead of 5*√36 * √2 = 30√2
- Simplifying 4√48 as 4√3, instead of 4*√16 * √3 = 16√3

This misconception can lead to incorrect simplifications and can be a barrier to further understanding of surds and their applications."
172,"When subtracting fractions, subtracts the numerators and denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to fraction subtraction, but they incorrectly apply the procedure by subtracting both the numerators and the denominators separately. They may misunderstand the concept that when subtracting fractions, the denominators need to be the same (or equivalent), and the subtraction should only be applied to the numerators while keeping the common denominator.

For example, when subtracting 1/4 from 3/4, a student with this misconception may calculate the result as (3-1)/(4-4), which is (2)/0, or when subtracting 1/6 from 2/6, they might write (2-1)/(6-6), resulting in (1)/0.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Subtracting 3/8 from 5/8: incorrect calculation would be (5-3)/(8-8) = (2)/0.
- Subtracting 2/5 from 4/5: incorrect calculation would be (4-2)/(5-5) = (2)/0.
- Subtracting 1/3 from 2/3: incorrect calculation would be (2-1)/(3-3) = (1)/0."
173,"Believes that if more than one number in a multiplication is divided by the same power of ten, the answer will be divided by the same power of ten. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of dividing multiple numbers in a multiplication by the same power of ten. They may think that if two or more numbers in a multiplication are divided by the same power of ten, the result will also be divided by the same power of ten. However, this ignores the multiplicative relationship between the numbers. When multiple numbers are multiplied, the effect of dividing each number by a power of ten is cumulative, resulting in a larger reduction in the product than if only one number was divided by that power of ten.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to simplify the expression 400 × 30 ÷ 100 and incorrectly assumes the result will be 400 × 30 ÷ 10 = 1200.
- A student is given the problem 800 × 50 ÷ 1000 and mistakenly thinks the answer is 800 × 50 ÷ 10 = 4000.
- A student is asked to calculate 200 × 40 ÷ 100 and incorrectly assumes the result will be 200 × 40 ÷ 10 = 800."
174,Confuses major and minor sector,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the major and minor sectors of a circle, particularly in problems involving circle geometry and measurement. A major sector is the larger part of a circle formed by two radii and the arc between them, while a minor sector is the smaller part. Students may incorrectly identify which part of the circle is the major or minor sector, leading to errors in calculations and problem-solving.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a sector: Students may incorrectly use the formula for the area of a major or minor sector, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When calculating the perimeter of a sector: Students may mistakenly add or subtract the length of the arc and the radii to find the perimeter of a major or minor sector.
- When solving problems involving the angles and proportions of sectors: Students may incorrectly apply the properties of major and minor sectors, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When interpreting pie charts and circular graphs: Students may misinterpret the data represented by major and minor sectors, leading to incorrect conclusions."
175,"Thinks that when multiplying decimals (less than 1), the number will get bigger","Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rule that multiplication makes numbers bigger, which is true for whole numbers. They may have learned that when you multiply whole numbers, the product is usually larger than the original numbers. However, when it comes to decimals less than 1, this rule does not apply. Students with this misconception may struggle to understand that multiplying decimals less than 1 will actually result in a smaller number.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- Multiplying 0.5 and 0.5: Students may think that the product will be greater than 0.5, when in fact it is 0.25.
- Multiplying 0.2 and 0.3: Students may expect the product to be greater than 0.3, when in fact it is 0.06.
- Comparing the products of 0.4 x 0.4 and 0.4 x 2: Students may think that the product of 0.4 x 0.4 will be greater than the product of 0.4 x 2, when in fact it is much smaller (0.16 vs 0.8)."
176,Believes that a reciprocal equation is defined when the denominator is 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that a fraction or a rational expression is undefined when its denominator is equal to zero. In the context of reciprocal equations, which involve expressions of the form 1/x or 1/f(x), students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that these expressions are still valid and defined even when x or f(x) equals zero. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect manipulations and solutions of equations.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When simplifying or manipulating expressions with reciprocals, such as 1/x or 1/(x-1), and not recognizing that these expressions are undefined when x=0 or x=1, respectively.
* When solving equations involving reciprocals, such as 1/x = 2 or 1/(x+1) = 1, and not excluding the values of x that would make the denominator zero.
* When graphing reciprocal functions, such as y = 1/x or y = 1/(x-2), and not recognizing that these functions have vertical asymptotes at x=0 or x=2, respectively, where the function is undefined."
177,"When the change in value is greater than the original amount, thinks percentage change = original/change x 100","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating percentage change and the change in value is greater than the original amount. They mistakenly believe that to find the percentage change, they need to divide the original amount by the change, and then multiply by 100. This error is likely due to a misunderstanding of the concept of percentage change, which is actually calculated by dividing the change by the original amount and multiplying by 100.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A shirt originally costs £10, but its price increases to £25. A student with this misconception might calculate the percentage change as (£10/£15) x 100 = 66.67% instead of the correct calculation (£15/£10) x 100 = 150%.
- Case 2: A person initially has £5 and then receives £10 more. A student with this misconception might calculate the percentage change as (£5/£10) x 100 = 50% instead of the correct calculation (£10/£5) x 100 = 200%.
- Case 3: A water tank initially holds 20 liters of water, but 40 liters are added to it. A student with this misconception might calculate the percentage change as (20/40) x 100 = 50% instead of the correct calculation (40/20) x 100 = 200%."
178,Thinks that the 10 becomes a 20 when adding in standard form ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with numbers in standard form (also known as scientific notation) and they need to add them. They might mistakenly believe that when adding numbers in standard form, the base number (in this case, 10) becomes double (20) instead of understanding that the exponent or power of 10 changes. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding numbers with the same exponent, for example: 2 x 10^3 + 3 x 10^3, the student might write the answer as 5 x 20^3.
- When adding numbers with different exponents, for example: 2 x 10^3 + 3 x 10^2, the student might write the answer as 5 x 20^2 or 5 x 20^3.
- When dealing with word problems involving large numbers in standard form, such as calculating the total distance traveled by two objects moving at different speeds, the student might incorrectly double the base number."
179,Does not understand the difference between a value on a graph and the gradient of a graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the actual values or points plotted on a graph (e.g., the y-intercept or a specific data point) and the rate at which the graph changes, which is represented by its gradient or slope. The value on a graph refers to a specific point or data value, often represented by the coordinates (x, y), whereas the gradient represents how steep the line is and can be calculated as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run). 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly interpret graphs, especially when dealing with real-world applications where understanding both values and gradients is crucial.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

1. A student is given a graph of an object's distance over time and is asked to determine the object's speed. Instead of calculating the gradient (which represents the speed), they might give the value of the distance at a specific time.

2. When analyzing the cost of goods sold over a period, a student might confuse the total cost (a value on the graph) with the rate of change in cost (the gradient), leading to incorrect conclusions about the rate at which costs are increasing or decreasing.

3. A student is given a graph representing the relationship between the amount of a substance and its effect. They might incorrectly interpret the effectiveness of the substance by looking at a specific value on the graph rather than the rate at which the effect changes (the gradient).

4. In a graph showing population growth over time, a student might mistake the population size at a specific time (a value on the graph) for the rate at which the population is growing (the gradient).

5. When working with linear equations, a student might confuse the y-intercept (a value on the graph) with the slope (gradient) of the line, leading to errors in graphing or solving the equation."
180,Writes the digit 3 times instead of cubing,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of cubing a number. They may think that writing the digit three times is equivalent to cubing it. For example, when asked to find 4 cubed (4³), they may write 444 instead of calculating 4 × 4 × 4 = 64.

This misconception can arise in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, like (2x)³, they may write 2x2x2x instead of 8x³.
- In numerical calculations, like finding the volume of a cube, they may write the side length three times instead of cubing it.
- When solving problems involving exponential growth, they may multiply the number by itself only twice, instead of three times.
- In data analysis, when dealing with cubic relationships, they may incorrectly represent the relationship by writing the digit three times instead of cubing it."
181,Assumes a ratio is part to part instead of part to whole,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of ratios, assuming that a ratio represents a comparison between two parts of a whole, rather than a comparison between one part and the whole itself. In other words, they think that a ratio is always a comparison between two equal or unequal parts, rather than a comparison between one part and the total or the whole.

For example, in the ratio 1:3, students may think that for every 1 unit of one quantity, there are 3 units of another quantity, and that these two quantities are separate and distinct, rather than thinking that for every 1 unit of one quantity, there are 3 units of the same quantity, making a total of 4 units.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

1. A recipe requires a ratio of 1:3 of sugar to flour. A student with this misconception may think that if they need 1 cup of sugar, they need 3 cups of flour, without realizing that the total amount of mixture is 4 cups (1 cup sugar + 3 cups flour).
2. A student is asked to simplify the ratio 2:6. They may think that the ratio is already in its simplest form, because they see it as a comparison between two parts (2 and 6), rather than realizing that the ratio can be simplified to 1:3 by dividing both numbers by 2.
3. A survey shows that 1 in 5 students prefer a certain type of music. A student with this misconception may think that this means that 1 student prefers that type of music for every 5 students who do not, rather than realizing that 1 in 5 means that 1 student out of a total of 5 students prefers that type of music."
182,Believes parallel lines have gradients of opposite signs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that parallel lines must have gradients with opposite signs, i.e., one line has a positive gradient and the other has a negative gradient. They may think that this is a condition for lines to be parallel, which is not the case. This misconception might stem from a misunderstanding of the relationship between the gradients of parallel lines or a lack of understanding of the concept of parallel lines in general.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the equation of a line parallel to a given line, students might incorrectly assume that the gradient of the new line must be the negative of the original line's gradient.
- When identifying whether two lines are parallel, students might mistakenly look for gradients with opposite signs instead of considering the actual relationship between the gradients.
- When graphing lines, students might incorrectly draw parallel lines with gradients of opposite signs, leading to incorrect visual representations.
- When solving problems involving parallel lines, students might arrive at incorrect solutions due to their misunderstanding of the relationship between the gradients of parallel lines."
183,Has confused cube numbers with prime numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definitions and properties of cube numbers and prime numbers. They may incorrectly identify cube numbers as prime numbers or vice versa. Cube numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself three times (e.g., 1³ = 1, 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27), whereas prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have only two distinct factors: 1 and themselves (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7). 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly classify numbers, such as thinking that 8 is a prime number because it is a simple, small number, or believing that 27 is a prime number because it is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 5 at first glance (although it is actually 3 x 3 x 3).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When students are given a list of numbers and asked to identify which ones are prime or cube numbers.
2. During a math problem that involves finding the prime factors of a number that is actually a cube number (e.g., 27).
3. When students are asked to generate a list of prime numbers and mistakenly include cube numbers.
4. In word problems that require students to apply the properties of prime or cube numbers to solve a real-world problem.
5. When students are working on a number sequence or pattern that involves prime or cube numbers and incorrectly identify the next number in the sequence."
184,Believes the space diagonal is the same length as the diagonal on the bottom face of a cuboid,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that the space diagonal of a cuboid is the same length as the diagonal of one of its faces, specifically the bottom face. They may incorrectly apply the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the space diagonal, using only the dimensions of the bottom face. This misunderstanding can occur when students have difficulty visualizing the three-dimensional shape of a cuboid and fail to consider the height of the cuboid in their calculations.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to find the length of the space diagonal of a cuboid with dimensions 4cm x 5cm x 6cm, they may calculate the diagonal of the bottom face (4cm x 5cm) and assume it is the same as the space diagonal.
- When comparing the lengths of the space diagonals of two different cuboids, students may incorrectly conclude that they are equal if the bottom faces have the same dimensions, without considering the heights.
- When solving problems involving the volumes or surface areas of cuboids, students may make incorrect assumptions about the length of the space diagonal, leading to errors in their calculations."
185,Thinks a positive y value in a column vector means to move down rather than up ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with column vectors in mathematics, particularly in the context of movement or translations on a coordinate grid. They mistakenly believe that a positive y value in a column vector indicates a downward movement rather than an upward movement. This misconception can stem from a misunderstanding of the standard convention used in coordinate geometry, where the y-axis points upwards.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When plotting a column vector on a coordinate grid, a student may draw an arrow pointing downwards from the origin if the y value is positive, instead of drawing it upwards.
- In a problem involving translations, a student may move a shape downwards by a certain number of units when given a positive y value, rather than moving it upwards.
- When working with column vectors to describe movements in real-world contexts, such as the movement of an object, a student may describe a positive y value as a downward movement, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In a mathematical modeling problem, a student may create an incorrect model by assuming a positive y value represents a downward movement, resulting in incorrect predictions or conclusions."
186,Does not understand the meaning of the word commutative ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to grasp the concept of the commutative property in mathematics, particularly in operations like addition and multiplication. The commutative property states that the order of the numbers being added or multiplied does not change the result. However, students with this misconception may believe that the order of numbers affects the outcome.

For instance, when asked to calculate 3 + 4, they might think that the result would be different if they were to calculate 4 + 3 instead. Similarly, when multiplying 2 and 5, they may assume that 2 * 5 is different from 5 * 2. This misunderstanding can lead to errors in calculations and problem-solving.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Swapping the order of numbers in a simple addition problem, such as 2 + 1, and thinking it changes the result.
- Believing that the order of numbers in a multiplication problem, such as 4 * 6, affects the product.
- When solving algebraic expressions, such as 2x + 3, assuming that the order of terms changes the result when adding or multiplying.
- When working with word problems, such as ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils, and his friend has 4 groups of 3 pencils,"" and thinking that the total number of pencils is different due to the order of the numbers."
187,Thinks there are 10cl in a litre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 10 centilitres (cl) in 1 litre, instead of the correct conversion of 100 centilitres in 1 litre. This error can stem from a lack of understanding of the metric system and the relationships between different units of measurement.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting between units of measurement in a recipe, for example, if a recipe requires 500cl of water, a student with this misconception may think it's equivalent to 50 litres.
- When solving problems involving the measurement of liquids, such as calculating the total amount of juice in a container that holds 5 litres, and a student thinks it's equal to 50cl.
- When comparing the capacities of different containers, for instance, a student may believe that a 1-litre bottle can only hold 10cl of liquid, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In science experiments, where accurate measurements are crucial, this misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions, such as when measuring the volume of a substance or the capacity of a container."
188,Believes interquartile range is the difference between one of the quartiles and the minimum value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of interquartile range (IQR) and believe it represents the difference between one of the quartiles (e.g., the lower or upper quartile) and the minimum value in a dataset. They may think that IQR measures the spread of data from the minimum value to a specific quartile, rather than understanding it as a measure of the spread of the middle 50% of the data.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the IQR, students might subtract the minimum value from the lower quartile (Q1) or the upper quartile (Q3), instead of finding the difference between Q3 and Q1.
- When analyzing a box plot, students may misinterpret the IQR as the distance from the minimum value to the lower or upper quartile, rather than the length of the box, which represents the IQR.
- In word problems, students might be given a dataset and asked to find the IQR. If they hold this misconception, they may incorrectly calculate the IQR using the minimum value and one of the quartiles, leading to an incorrect answer."
189,"When multiplying decimals, ignores place value and just multiplies the digits","Explanation: This misconception arises when students treat decimal numbers as whole numbers, disregarding the importance of place value. They may simply multiply the digits together, without considering the position of the decimal point. This is often due to a lack of understanding of how decimals represent fractions of a whole and how the placement of the decimal point affects the value of the number.

For example, when multiplying 4.5 by 3, a student with this misconception might simply multiply 4 by 3 and 5 by 3, resulting in 12 and 15, respectively, and then write the answer as 1215, ignoring the correct placement of the decimal point.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* Multiplying 2.5 by 4: A student might calculate 2 x 4 = 8 and 5 x 4 = 20, writing the answer as 820 instead of the correct answer.
* Multiplying 1.2 by 3: A student might calculate 1 x 3 = 3 and 2 x 3 = 6, writing the answer as 36 instead of the correct answer.
* Multiplying 0.8 by 2: A student might calculate 0 x 2 = 0 and 8 x 2 = 16, writing the answer as 16 instead of the correct answer."
190,"Does not account for grammar when writing algebra e.g. ,then making a group","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize the importance of using proper mathematical notation and grammar when writing algebraic expressions, particularly when working with groups or sets. They may not understand that in algebra, the way expressions are written can significantly affect their meaning and the order of operations. For example, students may not use brackets or other grouping symbols correctly, or they may not follow the correct order of operations (e.g., BIDMAS/BODMAS). This can lead to incorrect simplification or manipulation of expressions.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- Simplifying expressions with multiple operations, e.g., 2 × 3 + 4.
- Working with groups or sets, e.g., (2x + 3) + 4.
- Using algebraic notation to represent real-world problems, e.g., writing an expression to represent the cost of buying multiple items with different prices.
- Expanding or factoring expressions, e.g., (x + 2)(x + 3).
- Solving equations with multiple steps or operations, e.g., 2x + 5 = 11."
191,Believes that product means add rather than multiply,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term ""product"" as a general term for combining numbers, rather than understanding it as a specific mathematical operation that represents multiplication. As a result, they mistakenly add the numbers together instead of multiplying them. This misconception may stem from the fact that in everyday language, ""product"" can refer to the result of any operation, not just multiplication.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to find the product of two single-digit numbers, e.g., ""What is the product of 3 and 4?"" The student may respond with 7 (3 + 4) instead of 12 (3 × 4).
- When solving simple multiplication word problems, e.g., ""If Sally has 3 groups of 4 pencils, how many pencils does she have in total?"" The student may add 3 + 4 = 7 instead of multiplying 3 × 4 = 12.
- When working with mathematical expressions, e.g., 2 × 5, the student may evaluate it as 2 + 5 = 7 instead of 2 × 5 = 10."
192,Does not know how to calculate the volume of a prism,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand that the volume of a prism is calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the height. They may confuse the formula for volume with the formula for the area of the base or may not recognize the importance of the height in the calculation. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of volume as a three-dimensional measure or an inability to visualize the structure of a prism.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When students are asked to calculate the volume of a rectangular prism with a given length, width, and height, they may only multiply the length and width, forgetting to include the height in the calculation.
2. When given a triangular prism, students may incorrectly calculate the volume by using the formula for the area of the triangular base, without multiplying it by the height of the prism.
3. In real-world problems, such as finding the volume of a bookshelf or a swimming pool, students may struggle to apply the formula for the volume of a prism, leading to incorrect calculations."
193,Believes a cyclic quadrilateral can be self-intersecting,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a cyclic quadrilateral can have its sides intersecting each other. They may think that as long as the vertices of the quadrilateral lie on a circle, it satisfies the condition of being cyclic, regardless of whether the sides intersect or not. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definition of a cyclic quadrilateral, which states that it is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a single circle, but also implies that the sides do not intersect.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify examples of cyclic quadrilaterals and they include self-intersecting shapes.
- When students are given a set of points on a circle and asked to draw a cyclic quadrilateral, but they draw a shape with intersecting sides.
- When students are solving problems involving properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, such as opposite angles being supplementary, and they attempt to apply these properties to self-intersecting shapes."
194,"Believes the sides of a square must be horizontal and vertical, not diagonal","Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a rigid understanding of the properties of a square. They believe that for a shape to be a square, its sides must be parallel to the horizontal and vertical axes, and that the sides cannot be oriented at an angle. This limited understanding leads them to incorrectly identify or create squares that do not conform to this narrow definition.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing a square on a grid paper, a student insists that the sides of the square must align with the grid lines, and refuses to recognize a square that has been rotated to have diagonal sides.
- When identifying shapes in real-life objects, a student does not recognize a square shape that has been oriented at an angle, such as a square tile that has been placed diagonally in a design.
- When solving a geometry problem that involves rotating or reflecting a square, a student incorrectly assumes that the resulting shape is no longer a square because its sides are no longer horizontal and vertical."
195,"When solving an equation, thinks the divisor and dividend are the opposite way around","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the divisor (the number by which we are dividing) and the dividend (the number being divided) should be swapped or are the opposite way around when solving an equation involving division. For example, if the equation is 12 ÷ 4 = x, students with this misconception may think that 4 is being divided by 12, rather than the other way around.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When solving simple division equations, like 9 ÷ 3 = x, where students might think 3 is being divided by 9.
- In algebraic expressions, like 2x ÷ 5, where students might confuse the divisor (5) and the dividend (2x).
- When working with word problems that involve division, such as ""If 18 cookies are shared equally among 6 people, how many cookies does each person get?"" where students might mistakenly divide 6 by 18.
- In more complex equations involving multiple operations, like 12 + 8 ÷ 2 = x, where students might misapply the order of operations and swap the divisor and dividend."
196,Confuses a variable with an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a variable, which represents a single value or a range of values, and an equation, which is a statement that expresses the equality of two mathematical expressions. In essence, students may think that a variable (e.g., 'x') is the same as an equation that contains the variable (e.g., 'x + 3 = 5'). They may believe that the variable itself has a specific value or a fixed solution, when in fact, it's the equation that needs to be solved to find the value of the variable.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When students are asked to solve for 'x' in an equation like 'x + 2 = 7', and they think that 'x' is the equation itself, rather than a variable whose value needs to be determined.
* When students are given an expression like '2x + 3' and they think it's an equation that can be solved, rather than an expression that represents a range of values depending on the value of 'x'.
* When students are asked to graph a linear equation like 'y = 2x - 1' and they think that 'x' or 'y' is the equation itself, rather than variables that have a relationship defined by the equation."
197,"Believes an outlier is the value in a data set with the biggest denominator, even if this value is close to the mean","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of an outlier in a data set. They incorrectly assume that the value with the largest denominator or the most decimal places is the outlier, regardless of its proximity to the mean. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the true definition of an outlier, which is a value that is significantly different from the other values in the data set.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When analyzing a set of exam scores, a student identifies a score of 85.67 as an outlier simply because it has the most decimal places, even though it is close to the mean score of 85.
- In a data set of temperatures, a student labels a reading of 23.456°C as an outlier due to its multiple decimal places, despite it being near the average temperature of 23°C.
- When reviewing a list of sprint times, a student mistakenly identifies a time of 12.89 seconds as an outlier because of its decimal places, even though it is not significantly different from the other times in the data set."
198,"When multiplying a decimal by a power of 10, just adds a zero to the end of the number, not changing the place value of the digits","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to multiplying decimals by powers of 10. They might mistakenly assume that the process is as simple as appending a zero to the end of the decimal, without considering the actual effect on the place value of each digit. For example, when multiplying 2.5 by 10, students with this misconception might think that the result is 2.50 instead of 25, not realizing that the digits have shifted one place to the left.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When multiplying a decimal by 10, 100, 1000, etc., students might simply add zeros to the end of the number without shifting the digits to their correct place values.
- When dealing with real-world problems involving money, measurement, or other applications of decimals, students might misapply the rule of adding zeros, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.
- In word problems that involve scaling or enlargement, students might incorrectly assume that adding zeros is sufficient, without considering the proportional relationships between the original and scaled values."
199,"Believes that when multiplying a number with a power, the multiplier is added onto the power","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of exponentiation and multiplication. They may believe that when multiplying a number with a power, the multiplier should be added to the power, rather than raising the base number to the power and then multiplying the result by the multiplier. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the order of operations and the properties of exponents.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a student is asked to simplify the expression 2 × 3^2, they may answer 3^(2+2) or 3^4, instead of the correct result 2 × 9 = 18.
- When a student is solving an algebraic equation, such as 2x^2, and they are asked to multiply it by 3, they may write 2x^(2+3) or 2x^5, instead of 6x^2.
- When a student is working with geometric shapes, such as calculating the area of a square with a side length of 2^2, and they are asked to multiply it by 3, they may answer (2^2)^3 or 2^6, instead of 3 × 4 = 12."
200,"When solving simultaneous equations, thinks they multiply both equations by the LCM of the coefficients of the term being eliminated","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving simultaneous equations using the method of elimination. They mistakenly believe that to eliminate a variable, they need to multiply both equations by the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the coefficients of the term being eliminated. However, this is not entirely correct. The correct approach involves multiplying both equations by necessary multiples such that the coefficients of the term being eliminated are the same, not necessarily the LCM.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When the coefficients of the term being eliminated are 2 and 4, students may multiply both equations by 4 (the LCM of 2 and 4) instead of multiplying one equation by 2 and the other by 1, or one equation by 4 and the other by 2.
* When the coefficients of the term being eliminated are 3 and 6, students may multiply both equations by 6 (the LCM of 3 and 6) instead of multiplying one equation by 2 and the other by 1, or one equation by 6 and the other by 3.
* When the coefficients of the term being eliminated are 4 and 8, students may multiply both equations by 8 (the LCM of 4 and 8) instead of multiplying one equation by 2 and the other by 1, or one equation by 8 and the other by 4."
201,Believes substituting the starting value into an iteration formula immediately gives the solution,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of iteration in mathematics, particularly in algebra. They believe that by simply plugging the initial value into an iteration formula, they will immediately obtain the solution to the problem. However, iteration involves repeatedly applying a formula or process to the previous result, often multiple times, to converge towards a solution or to generate a sequence of values.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When solving equations using iterative methods, students might think that substituting the initial guess into the formula will directly give the root of the equation, without realizing the need for repeated iterations to refine the estimate.
* In sequences and series, students may believe that the first term of a sequence, obtained by substituting the starting value into the formula, is the only term they need to find, rather than generating subsequent terms through repeated application of the formula.
* In mathematical modeling and problem-solving, students might think that a single application of an iteration formula will provide the solution to a complex problem, when in fact, multiple iterations are required to achieve convergence or to generate a range of possible solutions.

This misconception highlights the importance of understanding the iterative process and the need for repeated applications of a formula or process to achieve a desired outcome."
202,"When asked to add fractions, multiplies instead","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the operation required to combine fractions. They may incorrectly assume that adding fractions involves multiplying the numerators and denominators together, rather than finding a common denominator and adding the corresponding numerators. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions, or from overextending the rule for multiplying fractions to addition.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When adding fractions with different denominators, e.g. 1/4 + 1/6
- When adding fractions with the same denominator, but the student is unsure of the correct procedure, e.g. 1/8 + 2/8
- When solving word problems involving the addition of fractions, e.g. ""Tom has 1/4 of a pizza and his friend has 1/6 of a pizza. How much pizza do they have in total?""
- When adding mixed numbers, e.g. 2 1/4 + 3 1/6"
203,Thinks that dividing both numbers in a multiplication sum by the same power of 10 results in equal answers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that dividing both numbers in a multiplication problem by the same power of 10 will result in the same product. For example, they might think that (10 × 10) / 10 = (1 × 1) because they divided both numbers by 10. However, this is incorrect, as the correct calculation would be (10 / 10) × (10 / 10) = 1 × 1, but (10 / 10) is indeed 1, but it is multiplied by 10 that was divided by 10 so it is actually 1 x 10 = 10 then divided by 10.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying large numbers and trying to simplify the calculation by dividing both numbers by a power of 10.
- When working with decimals and attempting to simplify the multiplication by dividing both numbers by a power of 10.
- When solving real-world problems involving scaling or proportional relationships, where dividing both numbers by a power of 10 might seem like a convenient shortcut.
- In problems involving conversions between different units, such as converting between grams and kilograms, or between milliliters and liters."
204,Confuses scalene and equilateral triangles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty distinguishing between the characteristics of scalene and equilateral triangles. A scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths and all angles of different measures, whereas an equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length and all angles of equal measure (60 degrees each). 

Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify or classify triangles as scalene or equilateral based on superficial characteristics, such as appearance, rather than verifying the specific properties of each type of triangle. This misconception can be further complicated by the fact that some students might only check one or two sides or angles, rather than ensuring all sides and angles meet the criteria.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When students are given a triangle with sides that appear roughly equal in length, but are not exactly equal, and they mistakenly classify it as equilateral.
- When students are asked to draw or identify a scalene triangle, but they draw or choose a triangle with two equal sides, thinking it meets the criteria.
- When students are given a triangle with one or two angles measuring 60 degrees, and they incorrectly assume it is an equilateral triangle without checking the lengths of the sides or the other angles."
205,Thinks there are 1000mm in a km,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to convert between different units of measurement, particularly between millimeters (mm) and kilometers (km). They mistakenly believe that there are 1000 millimeters in a kilometer, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the conversion factors between units. In reality, 1 kilometer is equal to 1,000 meters, and 1 meter is equal to 1,000 millimeters. Therefore, there are actually 1,000,000 millimeters in a kilometer.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When converting the distance of a road trip from kilometers to millimeters.
- When measuring the length of a long object, such as a bridge, in millimeters instead of kilometers.
- When solving problems involving the conversion of units, such as calculating the distance traveled by an object in millimeters when the speed is given in kilometers per hour.
- When reading and interpreting maps or scale drawings that involve measurements in kilometers and millimeters."
206,Thinks a cylinder is a prism,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify a cylinder as a type of prism due to its three-dimensional shape and the presence of two identical circular bases. They may focus on the fact that a cylinder has two parallel and congruent bases, similar to a prism, and overlook the key characteristic that defines a prism: having polygonal bases. As a result, they fail to distinguish between the two shapes and incorrectly categorize a cylinder as a prism.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are introduced to 3D shapes and are asked to identify and classify different types of prisms.
- During lessons on geometry, when students are tasked with describing the properties of various shapes, including cylinders and prisms.
- When solving problems involving the calculation of volume or surface area of cylinders, and students mistakenly apply formulas for prisms.
- In real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, where students may encounter cylindrical structures and incorrectly refer to them as prisms."
207,Confuses the terms faces and edges,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the faces and edges of a three-dimensional shape. They may incorrectly identify a face as an edge or vice versa. A face is a flat surface of a 3D shape, while an edge is a line where two faces meet. Students with this misconception may struggle to accurately count or describe the features of 3D shapes.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to count the number of faces and edges of a cube, a student with this misconception may incorrectly count the edges as faces or vice versa.
- When describing the features of a 3D shape, such as a pyramid, a student may confuse the triangular faces with the edges that form the base of the shape.
- When comparing the properties of different 3D shapes, such as a sphere and a cylinder, a student with this misconception may incorrectly identify the faces and edges of each shape.
- When solving problems involving surface area or volume of 3D shapes, a student with this misconception may make errors in their calculations due to incorrect identification of faces and edges.
- When creating or interpreting diagrams of 3D shapes, a student with this misconception may mislabel or miscount the faces and edges, leading to confusion and errors."
208,Believes a composite function requires you to place the inner function next to the variable of the outer function instead of replacing it,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to composite functions, which involve combining two or more functions to create a new function. In a composite function, one function is nested inside another, and the output of the inner function is used as the input for the outer function. The misconception occurs when students mistakenly think that to form a composite function, they simply need to place the inner function next to the variable of the outer function, rather than replacing the variable with the inner function.

For example, if students are given two functions, f(x) = 2x and g(x) = x + 1, they might incorrectly write the composite function (f ∘ g)(x) as f(x)g(x) = 2x(x + 1) instead of replacing x with g(x) to get f(g(x)) = 2(g(x)) = 2(x + 1).

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of how composite functions work.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When writing composite functions in algebraic form, students may place the inner function next to the variable of the outer function instead of replacing it.
- When evaluating composite functions, students may incorrectly substitute the inner function into the outer function, leading to incorrect results.
- When working with real-world applications of composite functions, such as modeling population growth or chemical reactions, students may misinterpret the relationships between variables due to their misconception about composite functions."
209,"When multiplying a vector by a fraction, adds the numerator to the top number of the vector, and the denominator to the bottom number of the vector. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of scalar multiplication of vectors. They incorrectly assume that multiplying a vector by a fraction involves adding the numerator to the x-component (or the top number) of the vector and the denominator to the y-component (or the bottom number) of the vector. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of vector multiplication and the concept of scaling vectors.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the result of multiplying a vector by a fraction, such as 1/2 times the vector (3, 4).
- When students are required to scale a vector by a fractional factor in a geometric transformation, such as dilating a shape by a scale factor of 3/4.
- When students are solving problems involving velocity or acceleration vectors, and they need to multiply the vector by a fractional coefficient, such as finding the result of 2/3 times a velocity vector (5, 6)."
210,Thinks the term in a sequence is double the position value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the term number and its corresponding value in a sequence. They mistakenly believe that to find a term in a sequence, they simply need to double the position of the term. For instance, if they are asked to find the 5th term in a sequence, they would multiply 5 by 2, resulting in an incorrect value of 10. This error indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of how sequences are constructed and how to identify specific terms within them.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Finding the 3rd term in the sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8... (Student's answer: 6, because 3 x 2 = 6)
2. Identifying the 10th term in the sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7... (Student's answer: 20, because 10 x 2 = 20)
3. Calculating the 8th term in the sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8... (Student's answer: 16, because 8 x 2 = 16)"
211,Believes displacement continues to increase even when returning to starting point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of displacement as a vector quantity that takes into account both magnitude (distance) and direction. They mistakenly believe that displacement is the same as distance traveled. As a result, when an object returns to its starting point, they think that the displacement continues to increase because the object has traveled more distance, rather than understanding that the displacement is actually zero since the object has ended up back at its initial position.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to calculate the displacement of a car that travels 10 miles east and then 10 miles west, and they answer 20 miles.
- A student is tracking the displacement of an object on a circular path and believes that the displacement increases with each revolution, rather than recognizing that it returns to zero after each complete cycle.
- A student is given a graph of an object's motion and mistakenly calculates the displacement by summing the total distance traveled, rather than taking into account the changes in direction."
212,Solves for y=0 instead of given y-value when reading from a quadratic graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the value of x from a quadratic graph given a specific value of y. Instead of finding the corresponding x-value(s) for the given y-value, students mistakenly try to find the x-intercepts of the graph, which are the x-values where y=0. This shows a lack of understanding of how to read and interpret quadratic graphs, particularly in relation to solving equations of the form y = f(x) for specific values of y.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the x-value(s) for a specific y-value on a quadratic graph, but they have previously only practiced finding x-intercepts.
- When the given y-value is not clearly marked on the graph, leading students to default to finding the more familiar x-intercepts.
- When students are not confident in their ability to read and interpret quadratic graphs, leading them to rely on the more straightforward method of finding x-intercepts.
- When the equation of the quadratic function is not provided, and students are only given the graph, making it harder for them to relate the graph to the equation and solve for the given y-value."
213,Thinks there are 10 mg in a gram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between milligrams (mg) and grams (g). They may believe that there are only 10 milligrams in 1 gram, rather than understanding that there are actually 1000 milligrams in 1 gram. This error can lead to incorrect calculations and conversions between different units of measurement, particularly when dealing with small quantities.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting between milligrams and grams in medication dosages, leading to incorrect dosage calculations.
- When measuring ingredients for cooking or recipes, resulting in incorrect proportions.
- When solving problems involving unit conversions in science or math class, leading to incorrect answers.
- When interpreting labels on food packaging or nutritional information, leading to misunderstandings about the content."
214,Does not understand the 'less than' inequality notation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of the 'less than' inequality notation, often denoted by the symbol '<'. They may have difficulty understanding that the '<' symbol indicates that the value on the left side of the symbol is smaller than the value on the right side. 

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Reversing the direction of the inequality (e.g., thinking that 5 < 3 means 5 is greater than 3)
- Confusing the 'less than' notation with the 'greater than' notation (e.g., thinking that '<' means 'greater than')
- Difficulty reading and writing inequalities in the correct order (e.g., writing 3 > 5 instead of 3 < 5)

Some short cases when this misconception may occur include:

- Case 1: When comparing the length of two objects, a student might write 10cm > 15cm, indicating that they think 10cm is longer than 15cm.
- Case 2: When solving a simple inequality problem, such as 2x < 6, a student might think that the solution is x > 3 instead of x < 3.
- Case 3: When reading a statement like ""5 < x < 10"", a student might interpret it as ""5 is greater than x and x is greater than 10"" instead of ""5 is less than x and x is less than 10""."
215,"When asked for a specific term in a sequence, just gives the position number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a sequence in mathematics. A sequence is an ordered list of numbers, and each number in the sequence is called a term. When asked to find a specific term in a sequence, some students mistakenly believe that the answer is simply the position number of the term, rather than the actual value of the term at that position.

For example, if a student is given the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and asked to find the 3rd term, they might incorrectly answer ""3"" (the position number) instead of ""6"" (the actual value of the 3rd term).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When finding the nth term of an arithmetic or geometric sequence.
- When identifying a specific term in a pattern or sequence.
- When solving problems involving sequences and series in algebra and mathematics.
- When interpreting data and identifying trends in statistics."
216,Believes the smallest number in a set of numbers is always their highest common factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of numbers. They may believe that the HCF is the smallest number in the set, rather than the largest number that divides all the numbers in the set without leaving a remainder. This misconception can occur when students are not adequately taught the definition and method of finding the HCF, or when they are not provided with sufficient practice to reinforce their understanding.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the HCF of a set of numbers that includes 1, students may assume that 1 is the HCF simply because it is the smallest number, without checking if it is indeed the largest number that divides all the other numbers.
- When comparing the HCF of two sets of numbers, students may incorrectly conclude that the set with the smallest number has the smallest HCF.
- When solving problems that involve finding the HCF of a set of numbers to determine the number of groups or the amount of a certain quantity, students may arrive at an incorrect answer due to their misconception about the HCF."
217,"When adding fractions, adds the numerators and denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of adding fractions. They may think that adding fractions is similar to adding whole numbers, where they simply add the numerators (the numbers on top) and the denominators (the numbers on the bottom) separately. This can lead to incorrect results, as adding fractions requires a common denominator to ensure that the parts being added are equal in size.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When adding 1/4 and 1/6, a student may incorrectly add the numerators (1 + 1 = 2) and denominators (4 + 6 = 10), resulting in an incorrect answer of 2/10.
* When adding 2/8 and 3/8, a student may incorrectly add the numerators (2 + 3 = 5) and denominators (8 + 8 = 16), resulting in an incorrect answer of 5/16.
* When adding 3/4 and 2/6, a student may incorrectly add the numerators (3 + 2 = 5) and denominators (4 + 6 = 10), resulting in an incorrect answer of 5/10."
218,Does not interpret a sloping gradient as a change in rate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand that a sloping gradient on a graph represents a change in the rate of the relationship between the variables being plotted. They may incorrectly assume that a sloping line simply indicates a constant increase or decrease, without recognizing that the rate of change is not constant. This misconception can lead students to misinterpret the relationship between variables, failing to recognize the impact of the changing rate on the overall trend.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is analyzing a graph of the distance traveled by an object over time, with a sloping gradient indicating an increase in speed. However, the student assumes the object is traveling at a constant speed, failing to recognize the change in rate.
- When graphing the relationship between the cost of goods and the quantity sold, a student may not recognize that a sloping gradient indicates an increase or decrease in the rate of change of cost per unit, rather than just a simple increase or decrease in cost.
- In a physics problem, a student is given a graph of an object's velocity over time, with a sloping gradient indicating acceleration. However, the student incorrectly assumes the object is moving at a constant velocity, missing the change in rate indicated by the sloping gradient."
219,Does not know that a right angle is 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the fundamental concept of angles and their measurements. They may understand that a right angle is a particular type of angle, but they do not associate it with a specific degree measurement, which is 90 degrees. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in identifying and working with right angles in various geometric contexts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to identify or draw a right angle, students may draw an angle that is not 90 degrees.
- When solving problems involving right-angled triangles, students may not recognize the relationship between the right angle and the other angles in the triangle.
- In real-world applications, such as building design or construction, students may not understand the importance of right angles in ensuring stability and structural integrity.
- When working with shapes, such as squares or rectangles, students may not recognize that the corners are right angles.
- In trigonometry, students may struggle to understand the relationships between the angles and side lengths in right-angled triangles."
220,Only multiplies the first term in the expansion of a bracket,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are expanding a bracket in an algebraic expression. They mistakenly believe that only the first term inside the bracket should be multiplied by the term outside the bracket, ignoring the other terms inside the bracket. This results in an incomplete and incorrect expansion of the expression.

For example, when expanding the expression 2(x + 3), students with this misconception might write 2x + 3, instead of multiplying both the x and the 3 by 2. Similarly, when expanding the expression 3(x - 4), they might write 3x - 4, instead of multiplying both the x and the -4 by 3.

This misconception can lead to errors in various algebraic manipulations, such as expanding expressions, simplifying equations, and solving inequalities. It can also hinder students' understanding of more advanced algebraic concepts, such as quadratic equations and polynomial functions.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* Expanding expressions with a single term outside the bracket, such as 2(x + 3) or 5(x - 2)
* Expanding expressions with multiple terms inside the bracket, such as 3(x + 2y - 1) or 2(x - 3y + 4)
* Simplifying equations involving expanded brackets, such as 2(x + 3) = 7 or 3(x - 2) = 11
* Solving inequalities involving expanded brackets, such as 2(x + 3) > 5 or 3(x - 2) < 9"
221,Thinks ratios are written as 1:total,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of ratios and believe that the first part of the ratio always represents one unit or one part, while the second part represents the total number of parts. They may think that a ratio is written with 1 as the first part and the total number of parts as the second part. For example, if there are 3 boys and 5 girls in a class, a student with this misconception might write the ratio of boys to girls as 1:8, instead of the correct ratio 3:5.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the number of different objects in a set, such as the ratio of boys to girls in a class.
- When simplifying ratios, such as simplifying 6:8 to 3:4, but mistakenly writing it as 1:4.
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios, such as scaling up or down the quantities of ingredients in a recipe.
- When interpreting ratios in real-world contexts, such as the ratio of wins to losses in a sports team's season."
222,Does not know the meaning of absolute value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of absolute value, denoted by the symbol | |, but fail to understand its true meaning. They may think that the absolute value of a number is the same as the number itself, without considering the sign. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly simplify expressions or solve equations involving absolute values.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving equations like |x| = 5, students may think that x can only be 5, and not consider the possibility of x being -5.
- When simplifying expressions like |3 - 5|, students may think that the result is -2, instead of 2.
- When comparing numbers like |3| and |-3|, students may think that |3| is greater than |-3|, instead of recognizing that they are equal.
- When graphing absolute value functions like y = |x|, students may think that the graph will only be in the positive quadrant, instead of recognizing that it will also extend into the negative quadrant."
223,Mixes up cubing with multiplying by 10,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that cubing a number (raising it to the power of 3) is equivalent to multiplying the number by 10 or simply adding zeros to the end of the number. They may think that because the result of cubing a number often results in a much larger value, it is the same as multiplying by 10, which is a common multiplication pattern. However, cubing a number is actually a form of exponentiation, which follows a different mathematical rule.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are given a simple cubing problem, such as 2³, they might incorrectly answer 20 instead of 8.
* When students are given a word problem that involves cubing, such as finding the volume of a cube, they might multiply the length of the side by 10 instead of cubing it.
* When students are working with numerical patterns, they might mistakenly identify a pattern that involves cubing as a pattern that involves multiplying by 10."
224,Forgets to swap the sign of roots when placing into brackets,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with quadratic equations or other algebraic expressions that involve square roots. When placing the square root of a number into brackets or parentheses, the sign in front of the square root must be swapped if it's being multiplied by a negative number or if it's being moved to the other side of the equation. However, students may forget to change the sign, leading to incorrect solutions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When solving quadratic equations of the form x^2 = a, and taking the square root of both sides, students might forget to write the negative square root as a separate solution.
* When rearranging algebraic expressions, such as moving terms with square roots to the other side of the equation, students may neglect to swap the sign of the square root.
* When simplifying expressions involving square roots, such as √(-a) = -√a, students might overlook the need to change the sign.
* When working with inequalities involving square roots, students may forget to swap the direction of the inequality when multiplying or dividing both sides by a negative number, including when the square root is involved."
225,Confuses frequency of one class with cumulative frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the frequency of a single class or category in a dataset is the same as the cumulative frequency, which is the total number of observations up to a certain point. In other words, they fail to distinguish between the number of times a specific value or range of values occurs (frequency) and the running total of all observations up to a certain value (cumulative frequency). This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect interpretations of data and graphs, such as histograms, frequency tables, and cumulative frequency curves.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Reading a histogram: A student might think that the height of a bar in a histogram represents the total number of observations up to that point, rather than just the number of observations within that specific class interval.
- Interpreting a cumulative frequency curve: A student may believe that the value on the y-axis of a cumulative frequency curve represents the frequency of a single class, rather than the total number of observations up to that point.
- Completing a frequency table: A student might fill in a frequency table with cumulative frequencies instead of the actual frequencies for each class interval.
- Solving problems involving data analysis: A student may use the cumulative frequency instead of the actual frequency to calculate measures of central tendency, such as the mean or median, leading to incorrect results."
226,Thinks rectangles have line symmetry in the diagonals ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a rectangle has line symmetry along its diagonals, meaning that if they draw a line along the diagonal of a rectangle, the two halves on either side of the line will be mirror images of each other. However, this is not the case for rectangles in general, except for the special case of a square.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing a rectangle and assuming that the diagonals divide it into two identical parts.
- When trying to identify the lines of symmetry in a rectangle and incorrectly including the diagonals.
- When working with real-life examples, such as designing a rectangular garden or building, and assuming that the diagonals can be used as lines of symmetry for aesthetic or practical purposes.
- When generalizing the properties of a square (which does have line symmetry along its diagonals) to all rectangles."
227,Ignores a more than question and just states one of the values,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked a question that requires a comparison between two or more values, but instead of making the comparison, they simply state one of the values given in the question. This often happens when the question includes phrases such as ""more than,"" ""less than,"" or ""greater than."" The students might focus on the specific numbers mentioned in the question and ignore the comparison aspect, leading them to provide an incomplete or incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A basket contains 15 apples, and another basket contains 20 apples. Which basket has more than 5 apples? (Student answers: 15 or 20, instead of identifying the basket with 20 apples as having more than 5 apples than the other.)
- Tom has 12 pencils, and his friend has 8 pencils. How many more pencils does Tom have? (Student answers: 12, instead of calculating the difference between the two amounts.)
- A bookshelf has 8 books, and 5 more books are added. How many more books are on the bookshelf now than it had initially? (Student answers: 8 or 13, instead of stating the increase of 5 books.)"
228,Divides rather than subtracts when given the command 'less than',"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the term ""less than"" in a mathematical context, particularly in word problems or instructions. When given a problem that involves finding a quantity that is ""less than"" a certain amount, some students may mistakenly perform a division operation instead of subtraction. This can lead to incorrect calculations and results.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A word problem states, ""Tom has 18 pencils and gives 4 less than that to his friend."" A student with this misconception may calculate 18 ÷ 4 instead of 18 - 4.
- Case 2: An instruction asks students to find a number that is 5 less than 20. A student with this misconception may calculate 20 ÷ 5 instead of 20 - 5.
- Case 3: A real-life scenario involves a store offering a discount of £5 less than the original price of £25. A student with this misconception may calculate £25 ÷ 5 instead of £25 - £5."
229,Does not account for scale on diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to consider the scale factor or ratio between the actual size of an object or area and its representation on a diagram or map. They might assume that the measurements on the diagram are the actual measurements, rather than being a scaled-down version. This can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the area or perimeter of a room or building from a floor plan or blueprint.
- When determining the distance between two points on a map.
- When measuring the length or width of an object from a scaled diagram.
- When solving problems involving similar figures or shapes, where the scale factor is not taken into account.
- When interpreting graphs or charts with non-standard scales or axes."
230,Thinks 1l = 1 cubic metre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to differentiate between units of measurement for volume, specifically litres (l) and cubic metres (m³). They may believe that 1 litre is equivalent to 1 cubic metre, which is not the case. This misunderstanding can be due to a lack of exposure to practical measurements or failure to grasp the concept of volume units.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the volume of everyday objects, such as a 1-litre bottle of water, with a cubic metre of water, which is a much larger quantity.
- When solving problems involving conversions between litres and cubic metres, where students may assume a 1:1 ratio.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring the volume of a swimming pool or a container, where accurate conversions between units are crucial.
- In science experiments, where precise measurements are required, and incorrect conversions can lead to inaccurate results.
- In mathematical word problems, where students are asked to calculate volumes or capacities, and they incorrectly assume 1 litre equals 1 cubic metre."
231,Thinks we can't write an equivalent multiplication sum for a division sum by using a reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that division and multiplication are separate operations that cannot be easily converted or related to each other. They may think that division is only about sharing or grouping objects, and multiplication is only about repeated addition. As a result, they struggle to see the connection between the two operations and fail to recognize that dividing by a number is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.

This misconception can lead students to believe that there is no way to express a division problem as a multiplication problem using a reciprocal, and vice versa. For example, they may not understand that dividing 12 by 3 can be expressed as multiplying 12 by 1/3.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

* When converting division word problems to mathematical expressions (e.g., ""If Sally has 18 cookies and wants to share them equally among 3 of her friends, how many cookies will each friend get?"")
* When simplifying complex fractions or rational expressions (e.g., simplifying 12 ÷ 4 to 12 × 1/4)
* When solving real-world problems that involve rates, ratios, or proportions (e.g., ""A car travels 120 miles in 2 hours; how many miles does it travel per hour?"")"
232,"When dividing by a fraction, switches to multiplication without also using the reciprocal","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing by a fraction and they switch to multiplication, but forget or do not understand the need to use the reciprocal of the divisor fraction. The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator. Students with this misconception may simply multiply the dividend by the divisor fraction without flipping the fraction, leading to incorrect results.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. 6 ÷ 1/2 = ? (Student answers 6 × 1/2 = 3, instead of 6 × 2 = 12)
2. 8 ÷ 2/3 = ? (Student answers 8 × 2/3 = 16/3, instead of 8 × 3/2 = 12)
3. 4 ÷ 3/4 = ? (Student answers 4 × 3/4 = 3, instead of 4 × 4/3 = 16/3)"
233,"Cannot estimate the relative volume order, for different objects","Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to visualize and compare the volumes of different objects. They may have difficulty estimating which object has a larger or smaller volume, even when given the dimensions or when visually comparing the objects. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between an object's dimensions and its volume, or a limited ability to mentally manipulate and compare 3D shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When comparing the volumes of objects with different shapes, such as a cube and a sphere, students may incorrectly assume that the object with the larger surface area has the larger volume.
* When given the dimensions of two rectangular prisms, students may struggle to determine which one has the larger volume if the dimensions are not directly comparable (e.g., one prism has a longer length but a shorter width).
* When comparing the volumes of real-world objects, such as a basketball and a soccer ball, students may incorrectly assume that the larger object (in terms of diameter) has a significantly larger volume, without considering the objects' actual dimensions and shapes.
* When working with scales and models, students may have difficulty estimating the relative volumes of the actual objects being represented, leading to incorrect conclusions about the real-world objects.
* When solving problems involving volume ratios or proportions, students may incorrectly assume that the volumes of two objects are directly proportional to their surface areas or dimensions."
234,Subtracts instead of adds,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they should subtract numbers instead of adding them. This can happen in various mathematical contexts, such as when combining quantities, finding totals, or solving problems involving addition. Students may misinterpret the operation or misunderstand the context, leading them to subtract instead of add.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to find the total number of pencils in two boxes, one containing 5 pencils and the other containing 3 pencils. They might write 5 - 3 = 2 instead of 5 + 3 = 8.
- A student is solving a word problem: ""Tom has 8 marbles, and his friend gives him 2 more."" They might calculate 8 - 2 = 6 instead of 8 + 2 = 10.
- A student is working on a simple addition problem: 4 + 2 = ?. They might write 4 - 2 = 2 instead of 4 + 2 = 6."
235,Thinks adjacent angles are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that adjacent angles, which are angles that share a common vertex and a common side, are always equal in measure. They may think that because the angles are next to each other, they must have the same size. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions in various geometric problems, particularly those involving angle relationships and properties of shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When identifying angles in a triangle, a student may assume that the two angles that share a side are equal, leading to incorrect conclusions about the triangle's properties.
* When working with quadrilaterals, a student may believe that adjacent angles are equal, which can lead to mistakes when calculating perimeter, area, or other properties of the shape.
* When solving problems involving angle sums, a student may incorrectly assume that adjacent angles can be simply added together, without considering their actual measures.
* When exploring symmetry and tessellations, a student may mistakenly believe that adjacent angles must be equal to create a symmetrical pattern, leading to incorrect conclusions about the properties of the shape or pattern."
236,Thinks corresponding angles sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that corresponding angles, which are angles that have the same position in two different intersections or corners, add up to 180 degrees. They may think this because they are confusing corresponding angles with supplementary angles or angles on a straight line, which indeed sum to 180 degrees.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying corresponding angles in a diagram and mistakenly labeling their sum as 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving the angles formed by two intersecting lines or transversals, and incorrectly assuming the corresponding angles sum to 180 degrees.
- When trying to find missing angles in a geometric shape or pattern, and incorrectly applying the 180-degree rule to corresponding angles.
- When comparing and contrasting different types of angles, such as alternate interior angles, alternate exterior angles, and corresponding angles, and getting their properties mixed up.
- When dealing with more complex geometric figures, such as polygons or 3D shapes, where corresponding angles may be present, but the student incorrectly assumes their sum is 180 degrees."
237,Believes a line of best fit can be drawn on a scatter graph with no relationship or correlation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a line of best fit can always be drawn on a scatter graph, regardless of whether the data shows a clear relationship or correlation. They may think that the purpose of a line of best fit is simply to join the points on the graph, rather than to model an underlying relationship between the variables.

In reality, a line of best fit is only meaningful when there is a clear correlation or relationship between the variables being plotted. If the data is randomly scattered or shows no clear pattern, it is not appropriate to draw a line of best fit.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Case 1: A student is given a scatter graph showing the relationship between the favorite colors of students in a class and their heights. Despite the fact that there is no logical connection between these variables, the student attempts to draw a line of best fit on the graph.
- Case 2: A student collects data on the number of birds seen in a garden over the course of a week and plots it against the number of clouds in the sky. Even though the data appears to be randomly scattered, the student tries to draw a line of best fit, believing that it will reveal a hidden pattern.
- Case 3: A student is asked to analyze a scatter graph showing the relationship between the amount of time spent watching TV and the number of books read per week. Despite the fact that the data shows no clear correlation, the student draws a line of best fit, thinking that it will help to identify a trend that is not actually there."
238,"When finding the mean of the data in a stem and leaf diagram, thinks you find the mean of the stem numbers","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a stem and leaf diagram and how to calculate the mean from it. They incorrectly assume that the stem numbers (the numbers on the left side of the diagram) are the actual data values, rather than just the tens or hundreds digits of the data values. As a result, they calculate the mean of only the stem numbers, ignoring the leaf numbers (the numbers on the right side of the diagram) which are the units digits of the data values.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are first introduced to stem and leaf diagrams and are not fully understanding of how to interpret them.
* When the stem numbers are single-digit numbers, making it seem like they could be actual data values.
* When the leaf numbers are not clearly distinguished from the stem numbers, leading to confusion about which numbers to use for calculations.
* When students are working with a large dataset and are trying to take shortcuts to calculate the mean, mistakenly thinking that using only the stem numbers will be sufficient."
239,Finds a common multiple but not the lowest common multiple,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers, but they end up finding any common multiple, which is not necessarily the smallest. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of LCM, which is the smallest multiple that is exactly divisible by all the given numbers.

For example, when finding the LCM of 4 and 6, a student with this misconception might list the multiples of each number and find a common multiple, such as 24, without realizing that 12 is the lowest common multiple.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the LCM of 8 and 12, the student might answer 48 instead of 24.
- Finding the LCM of 9 and 12, the student might answer 72 instead of 36.
- Finding the LCM of 6 and 8, the student might answer 48 instead of 24.
- Finding the LCM of 5 and 10, the student might answer 50 instead of 10."
240,"Misunderstands how to calculate the lower bound in a division, believes it is found by dividing both upper bounds","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to calculate the lower bound of a division problem involving measurements or quantities with given upper and lower bounds. Instead of applying the correct method, they mistakenly believe that to find the lower bound of a division, they should divide the upper bounds of the dividend and divisor. This shows a misunderstanding of how to work with intervals and bounds in division, particularly in measurement and quantity problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A 5-meter long piece of wood needs to be cut into equal pieces, each 0.8 meters long, with an error margin of 0.01 meters. The student might incorrectly calculate the minimum number of pieces by dividing the upper bound of the length (5.01 meters) by the upper bound of the piece length (0.81 meters).
- A water tank can hold 2400 liters of water, give or take 10 liters. The water is to be filled into 8 equal tanks. The student might incorrectly find the lower bound of the volume of each tank by dividing the upper bound of the total volume (2410 liters) by the upper bound of the number of tanks.
- A group of friends want to share some candy equally. If they have 36 pieces, give or take 2 pieces, and there are 4 friends, give or take 1 friend, the student might mistakenly calculate the minimum number of candies per friend by dividing the upper bound of the candies (38) by the upper bound of the number of friends (5)."
241,Thinks co-interior angles sum to 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that co-interior angles, which are pairs of angles formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines, sum to 360 degrees. This misunderstanding likely stems from the fact that a full circle is 360 degrees and students may incorrectly generalize this concept to co-interior angles.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals, students may incorrectly assume that co-interior angles are supplementary to 360 degrees.
- When finding missing angles in diagrams involving parallel lines and transversals, students may mistakenly use the incorrect sum of 360 degrees for co-interior angles, leading to incorrect calculations.
- In word problems involving real-world applications of co-interior angles, such as in architecture or design, students may incorrectly apply the 360-degree sum, resulting in incorrect solutions.
- When comparing co-interior angles to other angle pairs, such as corresponding or alternate angles, students may incorrectly assume that co-interior angles have a sum of 360 degrees, leading to confusion and incorrect conclusions."
242,Thinks the hundred thousands column is the ten thousands column,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the place value system, specifically the position and value of digits within large numbers. They may incorrectly identify the hundred thousands column as the ten thousands column, indicating a shift in their understanding of place value. This error suggests that students may be struggling to comprehend the relationships between digits and their corresponding place values, particularly in numbers with multiple zeros or large numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading or writing large numbers (e.g., 100,000 being read as 10,000)
- When comparing numbers with different place values (e.g., comparing 100,000 to 10,000 and thinking they are equal or close in value)
- When performing arithmetic operations involving large numbers (e.g., adding or subtracting numbers with multiple zeros)
- When solving real-world problems that involve large quantities or measurements (e.g., measuring distances or counting populations)"
243,Identifies a common factor but not the highest common factor,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding common factors between two or more numbers but fail to identify the highest common factor (HCF) among them. They may list out several common factors but not necessarily the largest one, which is the most important in many mathematical operations. For instance, when finding the HCF of 12 and 18, a student with this misconception might identify 2 as a common factor but not realize that 6 is the highest common factor.

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- When simplifying fractions: A student might simplify a fraction using a common factor that is not the highest, resulting in a fraction that is not fully simplified.
- When solving problems involving greatest common divisors (GCD): In problems that require finding the GCD to divide resources or quantities, identifying a common factor that is not the highest can lead to incorrect solutions.
- When working with equivalent ratios or proportions: Failing to find the highest common factor can result in equivalent ratios that are not in their simplest form, which can complicate further calculations.
- When factorizing expressions in algebra: Not identifying the highest common factor can make it difficult to factorize expressions fully, which is essential for solving equations and manipulating algebraic expressions."
244,Believes the solution of mx + c = 0 is x = m,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the coefficients in a linear equation and its solution. In a linear equation of the form mx + c = 0, 'm' represents the coefficient of the variable x, and 'c' is the constant term. The student mistakenly believes that to solve for x, they simply need to isolate x, and they incorrectly assume that x is equal to 'm', the coefficient of x, instead of correctly rearranging the equation to isolate x.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving simple linear equations, such as 2x + 3 = 0, the student may incorrectly write x = 2.
- When comparing the equation mx + c = 0 to the slope-intercept form of a linear equation (y = mx + c), the student may get confused and think x = m.
- When dealing with word problems that involve linear equations, such as ""Tom has 5 groups of x pencils, and he gives 2 pencils away. If he now has no pencils left, how many pencils did he have in each group?"", the student may incorrectly write the equation as 5x + 2 = 0 and then incorrectly solve for x as x = 5."
245,Does not realise that to maintain balance in an equation they must add or subtract the same amount from both sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental concept of equivalence in algebraic equations. They may think that they can add or subtract different values from each side of the equation and still maintain the balance. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of equality and the idea that whatever operation is performed on one side of the equation, the same operation must be performed on the other side to maintain the balance.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving linear equations, students may add 5 to one side of the equation but not the other, thinking that the equation is still balanced.
- When solving equations with variables on both sides, students may subtract a value from one side but not the other, resulting in an unbalanced equation.
- When working with word problems, students may translate the problem into an equation but fail to apply the same operation to both sides, leading to an incorrect solution.
- When simplifying equations, students may combine like terms on one side but not the other, disrupting the balance of the equation.
- When checking their solutions, students may plug their answer back into the original equation but fail to notice that the equation is no longer balanced due to their earlier mistakes."
246,Does not think a kilogram is a unit of mass,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between mass and other physical properties such as weight or volume. They may associate a kilogram with the concept of ""heaviness"" or ""size"" rather than a specific unit of measurement for mass. As a result, they may not understand that a kilogram is a standard unit used to measure the amount of matter in an object, regardless of its weight, size, or density.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing objects of different densities, students may think that a kilogram of feathers and a kilogram of rocks have different masses because they have different volumes or weights.
- When measuring the mass of objects on different planets, students may believe that a kilogram on Earth is different from a kilogram on the Moon, due to the difference in gravitational pull.
- When solving problems involving conversions between units, students may confuse kilograms with other units, such as grams or liters, because they do not understand the specific definition of a kilogram as a unit of mass."
247,Found the percentage but added it to 100%,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding a percentage, but mistakenly add it to 100% instead of the original value. They might interpret the percentage as an additional amount, rather than a proportion of the original value. For example, if a shirt is on sale with a 20% discount, students might think the new price is 100% + 20% = 120% of the original price, rather than 100% - 20% = 80% of the original price.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A store has a 15% sale on all products. If a student thinks the discount adds to the original price, they might calculate the new price as 100% + 15% = 115% of the original price.
- A person's salary increases by 10%. If a student applies this misconception, they might think the new salary is 100% + 10% = 110% of the original salary, but then incorrectly add 110% to the original salary, effectively doubling the increase.
- A recipe requires a 25% increase in ingredients. If a student adds 25% to 100%, they might end up with 125% of the original ingredients, but then incorrectly add 125% to the original amount, resulting in an incorrect total."
248,Believes a pie chart makes 360% not 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the concept of degrees in a circle with percentages. They mistakenly assume that the total value of a pie chart represents 360% instead of 360 degrees. This misunderstanding likely stems from the fact that a circle is divided into 360 degrees, and students might incorrectly associate this with percentages, which are used to represent proportions of a whole as a fraction of 100. As a result, they may think that the pie chart's total value exceeds 100%, leading to confusion when interpreting the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to create a pie chart representing the favorite colors of a class and the student thinks the total percentage should add up to 360%.
- When interpreting a pie chart showing the distribution of different types of music genres and the student believes that the total value of 360 degrees means that the percentages should add up to 360%.
- When comparing the proportions of different ingredients in a recipe using a pie chart and the student mistakenly assumes that the total percentage should be 360% instead of 100%."
249,Does not understand a denominator represents equal parts,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to grasp that the denominator in a fraction represents the total number of equal parts an object or quantity is divided into. They may incorrectly assume that the denominator is simply a number that comes after the numerator, without understanding its significance in determining the size of each part. As a result, students may struggle to compare fractions, add or subtract fractions with different denominators, or convert between equivalent fractions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing fractions, students may think that a fraction with a larger denominator is larger, without considering the size of each part. For example, they might believe that 1/8 is larger than 1/4 because 8 is greater than 4.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, students may not understand the need to find a common denominator to ensure that the parts are equal in size. For instance, they might try to add 1/4 and 1/6 by simply adding the numerators and denominators, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- When converting between equivalent fractions, students may not recognize that the denominator must change in proportion to the numerator to maintain the same value. For example, they might incorrectly simplify 2/4 to 1/2 by changing only the numerator or only the denominator."
250,Believes a fraction cannot have a numerator of 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of fractions and they understand the numerator as the number of equal parts they have. They might struggle to comprehend that a fraction can have a numerator of 0, as in their understanding, having 0 parts doesn't make sense in the context of sharing or dividing a quantity. They may think that a fraction must always represent a non-zero quantity.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying fractions, e.g., 0/5, students may think it's not a valid fraction because the numerator is 0.
- When solving equations, e.g., 2x = 0, students may hesitate to express the solution as x = 0/2, thinking that a fraction cannot have a numerator of 0.
- When dealing with equivalent ratios, e.g., comparing 0/4 to 0/8, students may believe that these ratios are not equivalent because the numerators are 0.
- When graphing functions, e.g., a function with an equation y = 0/2x, students may be confused about how to represent this on a graph, as they may not consider 0 as a valid numerator for a fraction."
251,"Includes a data point with the value, when asked to find the number of data points below a value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to determine the number of data points that fall below a specific value in a dataset. Instead of counting only the data points that are strictly less than the given value, they incorrectly include the data point with the exact value in their count. This error is often due to a misunderstanding of the concept of ""below"" or ""less than"", which excludes the value itself.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

1. In a dataset of exam scores, a student is asked to find the number of students who scored below 80. If there is a student who scored exactly 80, they might incorrectly include that student in their count.
2. When analyzing the heights of a group of people, a student is asked to find the number of people who are below 160 cm tall. If there is someone who is exactly 160 cm tall, they might mistakenly include that person in their count.
3. In a survey of favorite books, a student is asked to find the number of books with fewer than 200 pages. If there is a book with exactly 200 pages, they might incorrectly include that book in their count."
252,Does not think 'other' is an acceptable category for data,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that in data collection and categorization, every piece of data must fit neatly into pre-defined categories. They might struggle with the idea that some data points can be outliers or not fit into any of the specified categories, and therefore, 'other' is not seen as a valid category for classification. They may think that 'other' is not specific enough or does not provide meaningful information, and may try to force data points into categories where they don't truly belong.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Categorizing favorite colors: A student conducting a survey on favorite colors might only provide categories for red, blue, green, and yellow, and not know how to handle a response like ""purple"" or ""turquoise"", which would require an 'other' category.
2. Classifying types of pets: In a survey about pets, a student might create categories for dogs, cats, fish, and birds, but not account for other types of pets like hamsters, reptiles, or even exotic animals, requiring an 'other' category.
3. Analyzing modes of transportation: A student collecting data on how people get to school might create categories for walking, driving, taking the bus, and biking, but not consider 'other' modes like skateboarding or taking a taxi."
253,Does not recognise that all lengths on a cube are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that a cube, by definition, has all its edges of equal length. They may mistakenly believe that only the opposite edges or the edges on the same face are equal, but not all of them. This misconception can lead to errors when calculating perimeter, surface area, or volume of a cube.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- When asked to find the perimeter of a cube with a given edge length, a student might only count the edges on one face or the edges that are easily visible.
- When comparing the lengths of different edges of a cube, a student might incorrectly identify some edges as longer or shorter than others.
- When solving a problem that involves the volume or surface area of a cube, a student might incorrectly apply formulas, assuming that not all edges are equal.
- When constructing or drawing a cube, a student might not ensure that all edges are equal, resulting in an inaccurate representation of the shape."
254,Believes all triangle numbers are odd,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are first introduced to triangle numbers, which are the sums of consecutive integers starting from 1. Some students may notice that many of the initial triangle numbers they encounter (e.g., 1, 3, 6 is not but they may think 6 is a special case, 10 is not but again special, 15, 21) are odd and assume that all triangle numbers must be odd. They may overlook or downplay the fact that there are also even triangle numbers. This misconception can stem from an overemphasis on the odd examples, a lack of exposure to a wide range of triangle numbers, or a misunderstanding of the underlying pattern that generates triangle numbers.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to generate a list of triangle numbers and they only produce odd numbers.
- When given a triangle number sequence, students may assume that the next number in the sequence must be odd.
- When solving problems involving triangle numbers, students may incorrectly conclude that a particular triangle number is odd without checking its actual value.
- When exploring the properties of triangle numbers, students may make generalizations that only apply to odd triangle numbers, ignoring the existence of even triangle numbers."
255,Does not know the meaning of the word regular ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the term ""regular"" in the context of geometry, particularly in reference to shapes. They may assume it means ""normal"" or ""usual"" rather than understanding its specific mathematical meaning. In geometry, a regular shape is one where all sides are equal in length and all angles are equal in measure. Without this understanding, students may struggle to identify and work with regular shapes, such as regular polygons, or differentiate them from irregular shapes.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When asked to identify or draw a regular polygon, such as a regular hexagon, and they draw an irregular hexagon instead.
- When trying to calculate the perimeter or area of a regular shape, but using incorrect side lengths or angle measures due to a lack of understanding of the shape's regularity.
- When comparing and contrasting regular and irregular shapes, and they fail to recognize the key characteristics that define a regular shape."
256,Does not reverse the order of operations when solving an equation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to reverse the order of operations while solving an equation. In equations, operations are often performed in a specific order (e.g., parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction). However, when solving for a variable, students need to reverse this order to isolate the variable. If they don't, they may end up performing operations in the wrong order, leading to incorrect solutions.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Solving linear equations like 2x + 5 = 11, where students might add 5 to both sides first instead of subtracting 5.
- Solving equations with multiple operations, like 3(x + 2) = 15, where students may fail to distribute the 3 before attempting to isolate x.
- Solving equations with fractions, like 1/2x + 2 = 5, where students might multiply both sides by 2 without considering the order of operations.
- Solving quadratic equations, like x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0, where students may not reverse the order of operations correctly when factoring or applying the quadratic formula.
- Solving equations with variables on both sides, like 2x + 3 = x + 5, where students might not correctly reverse the order of operations when combining like terms."
257,Uses numerator as whole part of a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the numerator of a fraction represents the whole part of a mixed number or the entire quantity, rather than the part of the whole. They may incorrectly interpret the numerator as the total number of items, rather than a portion of the total. For example, in the fraction 3/4, students may think that the 3 represents the whole and the 4 is an additional quantity, rather than understanding that the 3 represents three equal parts out of a total of four parts.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When comparing fractions: Students may think that the fraction 2/3 is larger than 1/4 because the numerator 2 is greater than 1, without considering the denominators.
- When adding or subtracting fractions: Students may incorrectly add or subtract numerators, thinking that they are combining whole quantities, rather than parts of a whole.
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions: Students may incorrectly write the mixed number 2 3/4 as 23/4, thinking that the numerator 3 represents the whole part.
- When interpreting real-world situations: Students may misinterpret a recipe that calls for 3/4 cup of flour, thinking that they need 3 whole cups rather than three-quarters of a cup."
258,"When finding a missing number in a factor tree, multiplies by the factor given rather than dividing.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with factor trees, which are diagrams used to break down a number into its prime factors. When a missing number needs to be found in the factor tree, students with this misconception will multiply the given factor with a number, instead of dividing the number by the given factor to find the missing value.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the missing number in a factor tree of 24, with 4 as a given factor. Students with this misconception may multiply 4 by a number (e.g., 6) instead of dividing 24 by 4 to find the missing value (6).
- When determining the missing number in a factor tree of 48, with 6 as a given factor. Students may multiply 6 by a number instead of dividing 48 by 6 to find the missing value (8).
- When identifying the missing number in a factor tree of 72, with 9 as a given factor. Students with this misconception may multiply 9 by a number instead of dividing 72 by 9 to find the missing value (8)."
259,"Thinks that when drawing the elevation, the bottom layer does not need to be included ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to draw the elevation or side view of a 3D object, and they mistakenly believe that the bottom layer or base does not need to be included in the drawing. They might assume that only the visible or above-ground parts of the object need to be represented in the elevation, neglecting the fact that the base or foundation is an integral part of the object's overall structure.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When drawing the elevation of a building, students might leave out the foundation or base of the building, only drawing the walls and roof.
* When creating a side view of a bridge, students might not include the piers or supports that connect the bridge to the ground.
* When drawing the elevation of a 3D shape, such as a rectangular prism, students might only draw the visible sides and omit the base or bottom layer.

This misconception can lead to incomplete or inaccurate representations of 3D objects, which can affect students' understanding of geometry and spatial reasoning."
260,Thinks cubing a number means adding 3 to that number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of cubing a number. They may think that cubing a number is a simple addition operation, where you add 3 to the original number. For example, they might believe that 2 cubed (2³) is equal to 2 + 3 = 5, rather than the correct result of 2 × 2 × 2 = 8. This misconception shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of exponentiation and the meaning of the cube operation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are first introduced to the concept of cubing numbers and mistakenly apply the addition rule.
* When students are asked to cube a small number, such as 1 or 2, and mistakenly think that adding 3 is a quick and easy way to get the answer.
* When students are faced with word problems that involve cubing numbers, such as finding the volume of a cube, and mistakenly apply the addition rule to solve the problem."
261,When multiplying just writes the numbers next to each other,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplication and instead of performing the actual operation, they simply write the numbers next to each other. For example, when multiplying 3 and 4, they might write 34 instead of performing the calculation to get the correct answer, which is 12. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition or groups of objects.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to multiply 2 and 5, and they write 25 instead of calculating the correct answer.
- A student is multiplying 4 groups of 6 objects and writes 46 instead of performing the calculation to find the total number of objects.
- A student is solving a word problem that involves multiplying 3 sets of 9 pencils and writes 39 instead of calculating the correct total number of pencils."
262,Believes the intersection in a prime factor venn diagram does not contribute to the size of the number represented by a circle ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with prime factorization in the context of Venn diagrams, particularly when dealing with overlapping sets. They might believe that the numbers in the intersection of the Venn diagram do not contribute to the overall size of the number represented by each circle. This misunderstanding can lead students to undercount or misinterpret the factors and their relationships in the diagram.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the least common multiple (LCM) or highest common factor (HCF) of two or more numbers using Venn diagrams.
- When using prime factorization to compare the size of numbers, such as determining which number is larger based on their prime factors.
- When solving problems that involve finding the product of two or more numbers using their prime factorizations, and the intersection in the Venn diagram contains common prime factors."
263,"Does not understand direction of North East, North West, South East and South West cardinal points","Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the intermediate directions between the primary cardinal points (North, South, East, and West). They may find it challenging to visualize the positions of North East, North West, South East, and South West in relation to the primary directions. This difficulty can stem from a lack of spatial awareness, inadequate practice, or insufficient exposure to maps and navigation.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the direction of a location on a map, a student may incorrectly place North East and North West or South East and South West in the opposite positions.
- In a geography lesson, a student may have trouble describing the movement of a storm or a weather pattern from the North West to the South East.
- During an outdoor activity, such as orienteering, a student may become disoriented and struggle to navigate due to their inability to understand the intermediate directions.
- When solving a problem involving the direction of shadows or sunlight, a student may incorrectly determine the direction of the sun due to their misunderstanding of the cardinal points.
- In a real-life scenario, a student may have difficulty providing directions to someone, confusing North East with North West or South East with South West."
264,Subtracted rather than divided by a scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when a quantity is scaled down or reduced by a certain factor, they need to subtract the scale factor from the original quantity instead of dividing by it. This can lead to incorrect calculations and an incomplete understanding of proportional relationships. 

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the length of a scaled-down model, a student may subtract the scale factor from the original length instead of dividing by it. For instance, if a building is 100 meters tall and a scale model is 1:10, the student might calculate the model's height as 100 - 10 = 90 meters instead of 100 ÷ 10 = 10 meters.
- When reducing the cost of an item by a certain percentage, a student might subtract the percentage from the original price instead of finding the percentage of the original price and subtracting that amount. For example, if a shirt is on sale for 20% off, the student might calculate the discounted price as $100 - 20 = $80 instead of $100 - ($100 x 0.20) = $80.
- When converting between units, a student might subtract the conversion factor instead of multiplying or dividing by it. For instance, when converting 1000 grams to kilograms, the student might calculate the weight as 1000 - 1000 (since 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams) instead of 1000 ÷ 1000 = 1 kilogram."
265,Does not realise a quadratic must be in the form ax^2+bx+c=0 to be factorised,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to quadratic equations and factorization. They may understand that factorization involves expressing a quadratic equation as a product of two binomials, but they fail to recognize the importance of the quadratic being in the standard form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0. 

As a result, when given a quadratic equation in a different form, such as x^2 + 4x = 5 or x^2 + 3x - 2 = x + 1, they may attempt to factorize it without first rearranging it into the standard form. This can lead to incorrect or incomplete factorization, and ultimately, incorrect solutions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When the quadratic equation is presented in a non-standard form, such as x^2 + 2x = 3 or x^2 - 4x - 3 = 2x + 1.
* When the quadratic equation has been manipulated or simplified, such as x^2 + 3x - 2 = x + 1, and the student fails to recognize the need to rearrange it into standard form before factorizing.
* When the student is faced with a quadratic equation that has a constant term on one side, such as x^2 + 2x = 5, and they attempt to factorize it without first moving the constant term to the other side to create a standard form quadratic equation."
266,Identifies a letter as a common factor but doesn't identify a number as a common factor,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are able to recognize letters (variables) as common factors in algebraic expressions, but fail to recognize that numbers can also be common factors. This means that they might be able to factor out a letter, such as 'x', from an expression like '2x + 3x', but struggle to factor out a number, such as '2', from an expression like '2x + 2y'. This misconception highlights a lack of understanding of the concept of common factors and how it applies to both variables and constants.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factoring expressions like '2x + 2y', where the student might not recognize '2' as a common factor.
- Simplifying expressions like '3x + 3', where the student might not factor out the common factor '3'.
- Solving equations like '2x + 4 = 2(x + 2)', where the student might not recognize the common factor '2' on the left-hand side."
267,Writes the variable before the coefficient in an algebraic term,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly write the variable (usually a letter) before the coefficient (a numerical value) in an algebraic term. For example, instead of writing 3x, they write x3. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the conventional notation used in algebra, where the coefficient is typically written before the variable.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions, such as 2 + 4x, students may write x4 + 2 instead of 4x + 2.
- When multiplying a variable by a constant, such as 5 * x, students may write x5 instead of 5x.
- When solving linear equations, such as 2x = 6, students may write x2 = 6 instead of 2x = 6."
268,Believes lines of reflection must be vertical or horizontal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that lines of reflection can only be vertical (up and down) or horizontal (left and right). They may struggle to visualize or accept that lines of reflection can also be diagonal or at any other angle. This misconception may stem from limited exposure to various types of reflections or an overemphasis on reflections across vertical and horizontal lines in earlier learning experiences.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reflecting a shape across a diagonal line, students may incorrectly assume that the reflection should be across a vertical or horizontal line instead.
- When dealing with complex shapes or real-world applications, students may struggle to identify the correct line of reflection if it is not vertical or horizontal.
- When solving problems involving symmetry, students may mistakenly conclude that a shape has no line of symmetry if it does not have a vertical or horizontal line of symmetry."
269,"When finding the distance between 2 points, believes the distance is the coordinate of the furthest point from origin","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of distance between two points in a coordinate plane. They mistakenly believe that the distance between two points is simply the coordinate value of the point that is furthest from the origin, rather than understanding that distance is a measure of how far apart two points are, regardless of their position relative to the origin.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the distance between two points that lie on the same axis (e.g., (3, 0) and (6, 0)), the student may think the distance is simply the x-coordinate of the point furthest from the origin (in this case, 6).
- When comparing the distances between two pairs of points, the student may incorrectly conclude that the pair with the point furthest from the origin has the greater distance.
- When working with points in different quadrants, the student may become confused about which point is furthest from the origin and incorrectly use that point's coordinate as the distance.
- When solving problems involving the distance formula, the student may substitute the coordinates of the point furthest from the origin into the formula, rather than using the correct coordinates of both points."
270,Thinks the term polygons only applies to shapes with more than 3 sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of the term 'polygon'. They might believe that polygons are complex shapes with multiple sides and exclude simpler shapes like triangles. This limited understanding may be due to the way they have been introduced to polygons, focusing mainly on shapes like quadrilaterals, pentagons, and hexagons, without explicitly being told that triangles are also a type of polygon.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to identify and classify different types of polygons, they might exclude triangles from their list.
- When solving problems involving perimeter and area of polygons, students might assume the shape has at least four sides.
- During drawing activities, students might avoid drawing triangles when asked to create different types of polygons.
- In word problems, students might misinterpret the term 'polygon' as referring only to shapes with more than three sides, leading to incorrect solutions."
271,Believes triangle numbers are formed differently to the correct way,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of how triangle numbers are generated and calculated. They may believe that triangle numbers are formed by adding or multiplying the row number by a certain constant, or by following a different pattern altogether, rather than understanding that each triangle number is the sum of consecutive natural numbers. For example, they may think that to get the next triangle number, you simply add a fixed number to the previous one, rather than adding the next consecutive integer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the next triangle number in a sequence (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 10, ?), they may provide an incorrect answer based on their misunderstanding of the pattern.
- When given a triangle number and asked to explain how it was formed, they may provide an incorrect explanation, such as multiplying the row number by a certain constant.
- When tasked with generating a sequence of triangle numbers, they may produce an incorrect sequence due to their misunderstanding of the underlying pattern."
272,When finding a missing side of a parallelogram given the area completes an extra step of dividing by 2,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the length of a missing side of a parallelogram given its area. The students mistakenly apply the formula for the area of a triangle (which is 1/2 * base * height) to the parallelogram, resulting in an unnecessary division by 2. 

This misconception likely stems from the fact that students are familiar with the formula for the area of a triangle and mistakenly assume it applies to all shapes, or they may not fully understand the properties of a parallelogram. As a result, when given the area of a parallelogram and asked to find a missing side, they incorrectly divide the area by the given side length and then divide the result by 2.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the length of the base of a parallelogram given its area and height.
- Finding the height of a parallelogram given its area and base length.
- Solving word problems involving real-world applications of parallelograms, such as finding the length of a side of a garden or a room given its area.
- When comparing the areas of different parallelograms and finding their respective side lengths.
- When solving problems involving composite shapes that include parallelograms."
273,Thinks 1l = 1 cubic centimetre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between units of volume, specifically litres (l) and cubic centimetres (cm³ or cc). They may incorrectly assume that 1 litre is equal to 1 cubic centimetre, failing to recognize the significant difference in their magnitudes. 

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When comparing the volumes of different containers, a student might think that a 1-litre bottle holds the same amount as a 1 cubic centimetre measuring cup.
- When solving problems involving conversions between units, a student might incorrectly convert litres to cubic centimetres, leading to incorrect answers.
- In real-life applications, such as measuring liquids for a recipe, a student with this misconception might use a cubic centimetre measuring spoon to measure out 1 litre of an ingredient, resulting in a significant error.
- In scientific experiments, students might misinterpret data or make incorrect calculations due to this misunderstanding, affecting the accuracy of their results."
274,Confuses angle of a sector with the radius,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the angle of a sector is directly related to or even equivalent to the radius of a circle. They might think that increasing the radius of a circle automatically changes the angle of a sector within that circle, or vice versa. This misunderstanding can lead to errors in calculations involving sectors, such as finding the area or perimeter of a sector, where the angle and radius are used in different ways.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a sector, students might incorrectly use the radius as a direct multiplier or divisor to adjust the angle, thinking the two are directly proportional.
- When comparing sectors of different circles, students might mistakenly assume that a sector with a larger radius automatically has a larger angle, regardless of the actual measurements.
- When solving problems involving the relationship between the angle and arc length of a sector, students may incorrectly substitute the radius for the angle or vice versa in formulas.
- When graphing sectors or working with real-world applications like pie charts, students may misinterpret or mislabel data due to a misunderstanding of how the angle and radius relate to each other."
275,"When finding a point on a line, assumes the point is always the midpoint","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that whenever they are asked to find a point on a line, the point must be the midpoint of the line. They fail to recognize that a line contains infinitely many points, and a point on a line can be anywhere along the line, not just at the midpoint.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When finding a point that divides a line segment into a particular ratio, students may assume the point is the midpoint, rather than considering the ratio.
- When solving problems involving coordinates, students may assume that a point on a line is the midpoint of the line segment connecting two given points.
- When graphing linear equations, students may mistakenly plot the midpoint of a line segment as the only point on the line, rather than recognizing that the line extends infinitely in both directions.
- When working with geometric shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, students may assume that a point on a side of the shape is the midpoint, rather than considering other possibilities."
276,Adds rather than multiplies when scaling up in direct proportion problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand the concept of direct proportion and instead of multiplying the quantities, they simply add the increase to the original amount. In direct proportion problems, when one quantity increases, the other quantity also increases at a constant rate. However, students with this misconception tend to think that the increase is an addition rather than a multiplication.

For example:

* Case 1: If 3 apples cost £6, how much would 6 apples cost? Students with this misconception might add £6 + £6 = £12, instead of multiplying the cost by 2.
* Case 2: A recipe for 4 people requires 8 eggs. If the recipe needs to be scaled up for 8 people, students might add 8 + 4 = 12 eggs, instead of multiplying the eggs by 2.
* Case 3: A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. If it travels for 6 hours, students might add 150 + 150 = 300 miles, instead of multiplying the distance by 2.

In each of these cases, the students are adding the increase instead of multiplying, which leads to incorrect answers."
277,Thinks pressure is force per unit volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the definitions of pressure and density. They may believe that pressure is calculated by dividing force by volume, rather than the correct formula of force per unit area. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly calculate pressure in various scenarios.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Calculating the pressure exerted by a liquid in a container, where students might use the volume of the liquid instead of the area of the container's base.
- Determining the pressure of a gas in a cylinder, where students might use the volume of the gas instead of the area of the piston.
- Comparing the pressure of objects with different volumes but the same force applied, where students might incorrectly conclude that the object with the larger volume has lower pressure."
278,Believes a power of 2 has no impact on its value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of exponents and their impact on the value of a number. They may believe that the power of 2 (or any other base) is simply an additional notation, but does not actually change the value of the number. For example, they may think that 2^3 is equal to 2, rather than 8. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of mathematical concepts that rely on exponents.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions with exponents, such as 2^2 or 2^4
- Calculating the area or volume of shapes that involve powers of 2 (e.g., 2^2 for the area of a square)
- Understanding binary numbers, which are based on powers of 2
- Calculating exponential growth or decay in real-world scenarios
- Solving algebraic equations involving exponents, such as 2^x = 16."
279,Mixes up square rooting and cube rooting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the operations of square rooting and cube rooting. They may incorrectly apply the rules or formulas for one operation to the other, often due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental differences between the two.

For example, students may:

* Attempt to find the square root of a number by looking for a value that, when cubed, gives the original number (e.g., thinking that √8 is 2 because 2^3 = 8).
* Use the cube root formula (e.g., ∛x = x^(1/3)) to find the square root of a number.
* Incorrectly simplify expressions involving square roots or cube roots, such as √(x^3) or ∛(x^2).

This misconception can lead to errors in various mathematical contexts, including algebra, geometry, and problem-solving.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: Simplifying expressions - A student is asked to simplify the expression √(x^3) and incorrectly applies the cube root formula to get x.
* Case 2: Solving equations - A student is given the equation √x = 4 and tries to solve it by cubing both sides, resulting in x = 64.
* Case 3: Geometric calculations - A student is asked to find the length of the side of a square with an area of 64 square units and incorrectly uses the cube root of 64 to get an answer of 4 units."
280,Describes lines when asked to describe angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to describe angles, but they focus on the physical appearance or properties of the lines that form the angle instead of the angle itself. They may describe the length, direction, or position of the lines, rather than the amount of rotation or the size of the angle. This indicates that the students are not fully understanding the concept of an angle as a measure of rotation between two lines or planes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to describe a right angle, they might say ""it's a line that goes up"" or ""it's a line that is straight"", instead of describing the 90-degree rotation.
* When comparing two angles, students might say ""this angle is longer"" instead of ""this angle is larger"" or ""this angle is greater"".
* When asked to draw a specific type of angle (e.g. acute, obtuse), students might focus on drawing the lines a certain way (e.g. making one line longer or shorter) rather than paying attention to the size of the angle itself.
* When solving problems involving angles, students might mistakenly use the lengths of the lines to calculate the angle, rather than using the angle's measure."
281,Thinks that if two lines do not intersect on a diagram then they will never intersect and are therefore parallel,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of geometry, particularly with regards to the concept of parallel lines and the representation of lines on a diagram. They may believe that if two lines do not intersect within the boundaries of a diagram, it means they will never intersect at all, and therefore, they must be parallel. This thinking is often based on a visual inspection of the diagram rather than a deeper understanding of the properties of parallel lines.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are working with diagrams that have a limited scope or scale, making it seem like the lines will never intersect, even if they would intersect at a point outside of the diagram.
- When students are dealing with lines that appear to be parallel, but the diagram does not provide enough information to confirm this, leading them to assume that non-intersecting lines on the diagram are always parallel.
- When students are faced with more complex diagrams, such as those involving multiple lines or angles, and they rely on visual inspection rather than mathematical reasoning to determine the relationship between the lines."
282,Does not understand that a point on the line of reflection will stay the same when reflected ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to grasp the concept that a point lying on the line of reflection does not change its position after reflection. They might think that every point in a shape must move to a new location when reflected, not realizing that points on the line of reflection remain stationary. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect conclusions about the image of a shape after reflection.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When reflecting a shape over a line that passes through one of its vertices, students may incorrectly move the vertex to a new location instead of keeping it in place.
2. When reflecting a line segment that intersects the line of reflection at a single point, students might think that the entire segment will move, rather than just the part that does not lie on the line of reflection.
3. When reflecting a polygon with one side lying on the line of reflection, students may incorrectly reflect that side, thinking it will move to a new location, instead of remaining in place."
283,Believes reflection in y = -x switches x and y coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a point or a shape across the line y = -x simply involves switching the x and y coordinates. They may think that if a point has coordinates (a, b), its reflection across y = -x will be (b, a). However, this is not the case, as the reflection across y = -x involves a 90-degree rotation and a change in sign, not just a simple swapping of coordinates.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When graphing functions and reflecting them across the line y = -x to find the inverse function.
* When working with geometric transformations, such as reflecting shapes across the line y = -x to create symmetrical figures.
* When solving problems involving coordinates and reflections in real-world applications, such as computer graphics or engineering.
* When using graph paper to visualize and reflect points or shapes across the line y = -x."
284,Believes the gradient of a speed-time graph is the speed,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly interpret the gradient of a speed-time graph as the speed of an object, rather than understanding that the gradient represents the rate of change of speed, which is actually the acceleration. They may confuse the concept of speed, which is the rate of change of distance, with the concept of acceleration, which is the rate of change of speed.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When analyzing a speed-time graph of an object moving at a constant acceleration, students may incorrectly state that the gradient of the graph represents the speed of the object at a given time.
* When comparing the speed-time graphs of two objects, students may mistakenly conclude that the object with the steeper gradient is moving at a greater speed, rather than realizing that it is actually accelerating more rapidly.
* When asked to calculate the acceleration of an object from a speed-time graph, students may incorrectly use the gradient of the graph as the speed, rather than recognizing it as the acceleration."
285,Lines up the digits incorrectly when doing an addition involving two numbers with a different amount of digits,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are adding two numbers with a different number of digits, but they fail to line up the digits correctly. This often happens when they are using the standard column addition method. Instead of lining up the digits according to their place value (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.), they may line up the digits from the right or left without considering the place value.

For example, when adding 45 (two digits) and 123 (three digits), a student with this misconception may line up the digits as follows:

45
123

Instead of lining up the digits according to their place value, which would be:

  45
+123

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of place value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Adding 23 (two digits) and 456 (three digits)
* Adding 9 (one digit) and 74 (two digits)
* Adding 135 (three digits) and 27 (two digits)
* Adding 6 (one digit) and 983 (three digits)"
286,"when subtracting a fraction from an integer, just adds their absolute value and places a negative sign in front","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of subtracting fractions from integers. They incorrectly assume that subtracting a fraction from an integer is equivalent to adding their absolute values and then placing a negative sign in front of the result. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of subtracting fractions and the rules governing the subtraction of fractions from integers.

For example, when given a problem such as:

Case 1: 5 - 3/4, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the answer as -(5 + 3/4) or -(5 + 0.75) = -5.75.

Case 2: 2 - 1/2, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the answer as -(2 + 1/2) or -(2 + 0.5) = -2.5.

Case 3: 10 - 2/5, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the answer as -(10 + 2/5) or -(10 + 0.4) = -10.4.

This misconception can lead to incorrect solutions and a fundamental misunderstanding of mathematical concepts."
287,Thinks y = ? is a vertical line through ?,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the equation of a line in the slope-intercept form (y = mx + c). They may think that the equation y = ? (where ? is a constant) represents a vertical line passing through the point ?. However, this is not the case. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between the variables x and y in a linear equation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When graphing the equation y = 5, students may think that it represents a vertical line passing through the point 5 on the x-axis.
* When solving a system of equations, students may incorrectly assume that the equation y = 2 represents a vertical line through the point 2.
* When analyzing the graph of a function, students may mistake a horizontal line (e.g., y = 3) for a vertical line passing through the point 3."
288,Does not break down all factors in a factor tree to primes,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to create a factor tree to find the prime factors of a number. Instead of breaking down all factors into their prime components, they may stop prematurely, leaving some factors as composite numbers rather than fully decomposing them into primes. 

For example, when finding the prime factors of 24, a student may create a factor tree that looks like this: 
24 = 4 x 6, then stop there, without breaking down the 4 and 6 further into their prime factors (2 x 2 and 2 x 3, respectively). 

Short cases where this misconception may occur: 

1. Factorizing numbers with multiple prime factors, such as 36 or 48.
2. Finding the least common multiple (LCM) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using factor trees.
3. Simplifying fractions or rational expressions by canceling common factors.
4. Solving problems involving prime factorization in algebra, such as finding the prime factorization of an algebraic expression."
289,Writes the numerator and the denominator the wrong way round in a probability,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the positions of the numerator and denominator when writing a probability in fraction form. In probability, the numerator typically represents the number of favorable outcomes, while the denominator represents the total number of possible outcomes. Students with this misconception may write the total number of outcomes as the numerator and the number of favorable outcomes as the denominator, leading to an incorrect probability.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the probability of rolling a specific number on a die, a student may write 6/1 instead of 1/6, where 6 is the total number of possible outcomes and 1 is the number of favorable outcomes.
- When determining the probability of drawing a specific card from a deck, a student may write 52/1 instead of 1/52, where 52 is the total number of cards and 1 is the number of favorable outcomes.
- When finding the probability of getting heads when flipping a coin, a student may write 2/1 instead of 1/2, where 2 is the total number of possible outcomes and 1 is the number of favorable outcomes."
290,Thinks a decreasing sequence cannot be quadratic,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of quadratic sequences and functions. They may believe that quadratic sequences can only be increasing or have a U-shape, but not decreasing. They might think that a quadratic sequence must have a positive coefficient of the squared term, resulting in an upward-opening parabola. As a result, they may struggle to recognize or create quadratic sequences that have a negative coefficient, leading to a downward-opening parabola, which can represent a decreasing sequence.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, students may incorrectly assume that the graph cannot represent a quadratic sequence because it is decreasing.
- When analyzing a sequence of numbers that is decreasing, students may rule out the possibility that it could be a quadratic sequence, even if the differences between consecutive terms are not constant.
- When solving problems that involve quadratic sequences, students may incorrectly assume that the sequence must be increasing, leading to incorrect solutions or interpretations.
- When exploring real-world applications of quadratic sequences, students may be unable to recognize or model situations where a decreasing quadratic sequence is used, such as the height of a ball thrown upwards or the amount of money in a depleting account."
291,Thinks a negative y value in a column vector means to move up rather than down,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with column vectors in mathematics, particularly in the context of movement and transformations in a coordinate plane. Students may mistakenly believe that a negative y value in a column vector indicates an upward movement, rather than the correct interpretation of a downward movement. This misconception likely stems from a lack of understanding of the coordinate plane's conventions, where negative y values represent points below the x-axis.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to describe the movement represented by a column vector with a negative y value, such as (3, -2), students may say it represents moving 3 units to the right and 2 units up.
- When working with translations in the coordinate plane, students may incorrectly move points or shapes upward when given a column vector with a negative y value.
- When solving problems involving the addition or subtraction of column vectors, students may misinterpret the direction of the resulting movement if one or more of the vectors have negative y values.
- When graphing or plotting points on a coordinate plane, students may mistakenly place points above the x-axis when given a negative y coordinate.
- When working with real-world applications of vectors, such as navigation or physics, students may misinterpret the direction of movement or forces if they have a negative y value."
292,Converts fraction to percentage by putting % sign after the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a percentage simply involves adding a percentage sign (%) after the denominator of the fraction. They may think that this action automatically converts the fraction to a percentage, without realizing that a percentage is a specific way of expressing a value as a proportion of 100.

For example, if the fraction is 3/4, students with this misconception may write it as 3/4% or 4%, which is incorrect. They may also apply this incorrect method to other fractions, such as 2/5, which they might write as 5%, or 1/2, which they might write as 2%.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to convert fractions to percentages in a math problem, and they take a shortcut by adding a percentage sign without doing the necessary calculations.
- When students are working with real-world data, such as calculating discounts or interest rates, and they need to convert fractions to percentages to make sense of the data.
- When students are comparing different proportions or ratios, and they need to express them as percentages to make a comparison, but they use this incorrect method."
293,Does not understand that similar shapes sides must all have the same scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that for two shapes to be similar, the ratio of the lengths of their corresponding sides must be the same. They may understand that similar shapes have the same shape but not the same size, but they do not grasp the concept that the scale factor must be consistent across all corresponding sides.

For example, students with this misconception may:

- Believe that two shapes are similar if some of their corresponding sides are in proportion, but not all of them.
- Think that a shape can be similar to another shape if the ratio of their corresponding sides is not the same, but close enough (e.g., 1:2 and 1:2.5).
- Fail to recognize that if the scale factor between two shapes is 2:1 for one pair of corresponding sides, it must also be 2:1 for all other pairs of corresponding sides.

This misconception can lead to errors in problem-solving, such as incorrectly identifying similar shapes or calculating incorrect scale factors. It can also hinder students' ability to apply geometric concepts to real-world problems, such as architecture, engineering, and design.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is given two rectangles, one with dimensions 4cm x 6cm and the other with dimensions 8cm x 10cm. They incorrectly conclude that the two rectangles are similar because the ratio of their corresponding sides is close to 2:1.
2. A student is asked to draw a shape similar to a given triangle with a scale factor of 3:1. However, they only apply the scale factor to two sides of the triangle, resulting in a shape that is not similar to the original.
3. A student is given a diagram of two similar triangles and is asked to find the length of a missing side. However, they use a different scale factor for different pairs of corresponding sides, resulting in an incorrect answer."
294,Thinks that only the sides need to be equal for a polygon to be regular,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that as long as all sides of a polygon are equal, it automatically qualifies as a regular polygon. They might overlook or be unaware of the additional requirement that all interior angles of the polygon must also be equal for it to be considered regular. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly identify certain polygons as regular when, in fact, they are not.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing or identifying regular polygons, students may focus solely on ensuring the sides are of equal length, without considering the angles.
- When classifying polygons, students might label an equilateral triangle with unequal angles (which is not possible in reality, but they might draw it incorrectly) or an isosceles quadrilateral as regular, based solely on the side lengths.
- When asked to create or identify examples of regular polygons in real-world contexts, such as architecture or art, students may again focus primarily on side lengths, neglecting the importance of equal angles."
295,Does not know the word and/or does not know the function of a compass,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the term ""compass"" or do not understand its purpose in geometric and measurement contexts. A compass is a crucial tool in mathematics, particularly in geometry, used for drawing circles, arcs, and measuring distances. However, some students may not have been exposed to a compass before, or they may have seen one but not fully comprehend its functions.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding and completing tasks that involve using a compass, such as drawing circles, creating geometric shapes, or measuring lengths. Students may struggle to visualize or execute mathematical concepts that rely heavily on the use of a compass.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to draw a circle with a specific radius using a compass, a student may not know how to adjust the compass to achieve the desired radius.
2. When tasked with measuring the length of a line segment using a compass, a student may not understand how to set the compass to the correct length.
3. When instructed to create a geometric shape, such as a triangle or a hexagon, using a compass and straightedge, a student may not know how to use the compass to draw the required arcs and lines.
4. When working on a construction project that requires the use of a compass to create a circular or curved shape, a student may not be able to accurately execute the design due to a lack of understanding of the compass's function."
296,Ordered fractions by comparing denominators rather than using equivalent fractions.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that the fraction with the larger denominator is the larger fraction, or vice versa. They compare the denominators of two fractions and assume that the one with the larger denominator is the larger fraction, without considering the numerators or finding equivalent fractions. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions and how they can be used to compare fractions.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- Comparing 1/4 and 1/6: Students may think 1/6 is larger because 6 is larger than 4.
- Comparing 3/8 and 2/10: Students may think 2/10 is larger because 10 is larger than 8.
- Comparing 2/3 and 3/4: Students may think 3/4 is larger because 4 is larger than 3, without considering the equivalent fractions.
- Comparing 5/12 and 3/8: Students may think 5/12 is larger because 12 is larger than 8, without finding equivalent fractions to compare."
297,Forgets you need a compass to draw arcs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to draw arcs or circles as part of geometric constructions, such as constructing angles, bisecting lines, or creating circles. They may incorrectly assume that arcs can be drawn freehand or using a ruler, forgetting that a compass is necessary to create accurate and precise arcs.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When constructing angles, such as drawing an angle bisector or creating an angle of a specific measure.
- When bisecting lines or creating perpendicular bisectors.
- When drawing circles or arcs as part of geometric shapes or patterns.
- When creating geometric constructions, such as constructing triangles or quadrilaterals with specific properties.
- When solving problems involving loci, where students need to draw arcs to represent the locus of points that satisfy certain conditions."
298,Confuses a constant with a variable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a constant, which is a value that remains unchanged, and a variable, which is a symbol that represents a value that can change. In algebra, constants are often represented by numbers, while variables are represented by letters. Students who hold this misconception may think that a letter always represents a variable, even if it is used to represent a constant value in a specific context. They may also believe that a number can be a variable, leading to confusion when solving equations or interpreting algebraic expressions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are given an equation with a letter that represents a constant value, such as ""Find the value of x in 2x + 5 = 11, where x is a fixed number.""
- When students are asked to identify the variables in an equation, and they incorrectly identify a constant as a variable.
- When students are solving a problem that involves substituting values into an equation, and they treat a constant as if it were a variable.
- When students are working with formulas, such as the formula for the area of a circle (A = πr^2), and they think that π is a variable that can be changed.
- When students are graphing a function and they think that the y-intercept is a variable that can be changed, rather than a constant that determines the position of the graph."
299,"When solving time problems, finds the difference in the hours and the difference in the minutes but then assumes the minutes will be added on to the number of hours","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating time intervals and they correctly find the difference in hours and minutes between two times, but then incorrectly assume that the minutes are always added to the hours. This results in an incorrect calculation of the total time interval.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the time interval between 9:45 AM and 3:15 PM, a student may find the difference in hours (3:00 PM - 9:00 AM = 6 hours) and the difference in minutes (15 - 45 = -30 minutes), but then assume that the 30 minutes (after converting to a positive value) should be added to the hours (6 hours + 30 minutes), instead of subtracting 30 minutes from 6 hours to get 5 hours 30 minutes.

- When finding the time interval between 8:10 AM and 2:50 PM, a student may find the difference in hours (2:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 6 hours) and the difference in minutes (50 - 10 = 40 minutes), but then assume that the 40 minutes should be added to the hours as a separate unit of time (6 hours + 40 minutes), without considering that this is indeed the correct total time interval in this specific case, but the understanding is flawed.

- When calculating the time interval between 10:55 AM and 4:35 PM, a student may find the difference in hours (4:00 PM - 10:00 AM = 6 hours) and the difference in minutes (35 - 55 = -20 minutes), but then assume that the 20 minutes (after converting to a positive value) should be added to the hours (6 hours + 20 minutes), instead of subtracting 20 minutes from 6 hours to get 5 hours 40 minutes."
300,Believes a direct proportion graph does not have to start at the origin,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to direct proportion graphs, which are represented by a straight line. They may mistakenly believe that the graph does not necessarily have to pass through the origin (0, 0), as long as it is a straight line. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the definition of direct proportion, which states that as one quantity increases, the other quantity increases at a constant rate, with the two quantities being directly related by a constant of proportionality.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing the relationship between the cost of goods and the number of items purchased, a student might draw a straight line that does not pass through the origin, even though the cost is directly proportional to the number of items.
- When analyzing the relationship between the distance traveled and time, a student may plot a straight line that does not start at the origin, despite the fact that distance is directly proportional to time at a constant speed.
- When working with conversion between units, such as converting between different currencies or units of measurement, students may not realize that the conversion graph should pass through the origin, as the conversion is a direct proportion."
301,Thinks you can multiply by a decimal to find a multiple of a number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplication and its relationship with decimals. They may believe that multiplying a number by a decimal will result in a multiple of the original number, similar to how multiplying by a whole number does. For example, they might think that 4 × 0.5 = 8, because they are expecting the result to be a multiple of 4. However, the actual result of this multiplication is 2, which is half of 4, not a multiple of it.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When converting between fractions and decimals, students might think that multiplying by the decimal equivalent of a fraction will give them a multiple of the original number.
- When solving real-world problems involving proportions or percentages, students may incorrectly multiply by a decimal to find a multiple of a quantity.
- When working with ratios and proportions, students might mistakenly multiply by a decimal to find an equivalent ratio or proportion.
- In measurement and scaling problems, students may incorrectly multiply by a decimal scale factor to find a multiple of a measurement.
- In data analysis and statistics, students might misinterpret data or graphs by thinking that multiplying by a decimal will give them a multiple of the original value."
302,Assumed each part of a fraction diagram is worth 10%,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that each part of a fraction diagram represents 10% of the whole. They may assume that because the diagram is often divided into equal parts, each part automatically represents a tenth of the total, regardless of the actual number of parts. This misconception is likely rooted in students' familiarity with percentages and the common practice of dividing objects into tenths.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to shade 1/8 of a diagram that is divided into 8 equal parts, they may incorrectly assume that each part represents 10% and calculate the shaded area as 10% instead of 12.5%.
- When a diagram is divided into 6 equal parts, and a student is asked to find the percentage represented by 2 parts, they may mistakenly assume that each part is worth 10% and calculate the total as 20% instead of 33.33%.
- When a student is asked to create a fraction diagram to represent 25%, they may incorrectly divide the diagram into 10 parts and shade 2.5 parts, instead of dividing it into 4 parts and shading 1 part."
303,"Believes that when eliminating a variable, if the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are the same, we do the operation inverse to the sign (- if positive, + if negative)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are trying to eliminate a variable in a system of linear equations by adding or subtracting the equations. They mistakenly believe that if the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are the same (both positive or both negative), they should perform the operation that is inverse to the sign. For example, if both terms are positive, they think they should subtract the equations (because subtraction is the inverse of addition), and if both terms are negative, they think they should add the equations (because addition is the inverse of subtraction).

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When adding or subtracting equations to eliminate a variable in a system of linear equations, e.g. 2x + 3y = 7 and x + 3y = 4.
- When combining like terms in algebraic expressions, e.g. 2x + 3x = ?
- When solving linear equations with multiple variables, e.g. 2x + 2y = 6 and x + 2y = 3.

For instance, a student with this misconception might attempt to eliminate the variable 'y' in the following system of equations:

2x + 3y = 7
x + 3y = 4

By subtracting the second equation from the first equation because the terms with matching coefficients (3y) have the same sign (positive). However, this operation does not actually eliminate the variable 'y' because the student has applied the incorrect operation."
304,Believes knowing the perimeter of squares does not give you enough information to find the perimeter of combines shapes using those squares,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to apply their understanding of individual shapes to more complex, combined shapes. They may believe that knowing the perimeter of individual squares does not provide sufficient information to calculate the perimeter of a new shape created by combining those squares. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the perimeter of a shape made up of multiple connected squares, and they are only given the side length of one square.
- When students are presented with a shape that consists of squares with different side lengths, and they are unsure how to use the perimeters of the individual squares to calculate the total perimeter.
- When students are given a shape with squares that share sides, and they mistakenly believe that they need more information to calculate the perimeter, rather than understanding that the shared sides should only be counted once.
- When students are faced with a shape that has squares with gaps or overlaps, and they are unsure how to account for these when calculating the perimeter."
305,Does not know the formula for area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or have not fully grasped the formula for calculating the area of a trapezium. A trapezium is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides, and its area formula is different from other shapes such as rectangles, triangles, or circles. The misconception might stem from a lack of exposure to the formula, difficulty in understanding its derivation, or simply memorization issues.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to find the area of a trapezium with given parallel sides and height.
- When comparing the areas of different trapezia and the student is unable to calculate the area correctly.
- When solving real-world problems, such as finding the area of a trapezium-shaped garden or a trapezium-shaped roof.
- When dealing with composite shapes that include trapezia and require the calculation of the total area.
- When asked to derive or explain the formula for the area of a trapezium, and the student is unable to do so."
306,Added rather than multiplied by a scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add a scale factor to a quantity instead of multiplying it, often due to a misunderstanding of proportional relationships. When scaling up or down a shape, object, or quantity, students may incorrectly add the scale factor to the original measurement, rather than multiplying it. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of proportional relationships.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Enlarging a shape: A student is asked to enlarge a rectangle by a scale factor of 3. Instead of multiplying the length and width by 3, they add 3 to each dimension.
- Scaling recipes: A recipe is being scaled up by a factor of 2. Instead of multiplying the ingredients by 2, the student adds 2 to each ingredient.
- Calculating similar triangles: When solving problems involving similar triangles, students may add the scale factor to the lengths of the sides instead of multiplying them.
- Converting between units: When converting between units, such as from millimeters to centimeters, students may add the conversion factor instead of multiplying it."
307,"When using Pythagoras to find the height of an isosceles triangle, uses the whole base instead of half","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are applying the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the two legs (sides that are equal) meet at the vertex angle, and the base is the side opposite to the vertex angle. The height of the isosceles triangle is drawn from the vertex angle to the midpoint of the base, creating two right triangles.

However, students with this misconception may incorrectly use the entire length of the base as one of the sides in the Pythagorean theorem, rather than half of the base, which is the correct length to use. This error is likely due to a misunderstanding of the properties of isosceles triangles or a failure to recognize the need to divide the base in half when applying the Pythagorean theorem.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Finding the height of an isosceles triangle given the length of the base and one of the equal sides.
- Calculating the length of the equal sides of an isosceles triangle given the height and base.
- Determining the area of an isosceles triangle, which requires the height, and mistakenly using the whole base instead of half.
- Solving problems involving right triangles formed within an isosceles triangle, where the student fails to account for the base being divided in half."
308,Believes that dividing by 100 gives 10%,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between division and percentages. They may think that dividing a number by 100 will automatically give them 10% of the original value, rather than realizing that dividing by 100 actually gives 1% of the original value. This error can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of percentages and how they relate to division.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating discounts or markups: A student might think that dividing the original price by 100 and then multiplying by 10 will give them a 10% discount, when in fact it will give them a 1% discount multiplied by 10.
- When finding a percentage of a number: A student may divide the number by 100 and then multiply by 10 to find 10%, instead of just multiplying the number by 0.1 or dividing by 10.
- When working with real-world problems: In everyday situations, students may encounter problems that involve calculating percentages, such as tips, commissions, or interest rates. If they hold this misconception, they will arrive at incorrect solutions."
309,Believes angles on a straight line add to 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between angles on a straight line. They mistakenly recall that the sum of angles on a straight line is 90 degrees, which is actually the definition of a right angle. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the properties of straight lines and angles or from a misinterpretation of the properties of right angles.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to calculate the missing angle on a straight line, students may subtract the given angle from 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving intersecting lines, students may incorrectly apply the 90-degree rule to find the sum of angles on a straight line.
- When drawing or interpreting diagrams involving angles on a straight line, students may incorrectly label or calculate the angles, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When solving problems in trigonometry or geometry that involve angles on a straight line, students may apply the incorrect 90-degree rule, leading to incorrect calculations and answers."
310,"Guesses when something is ""twice as high/much"", rather than multiplying by 2","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the result of doubling a quantity, but instead of performing the multiplication operation, they make an incorrect estimate or guess. The students may not fully understand the concept of scaling or proportionality, leading them to make inaccurate judgments about what it means for something to be ""twice as high"" or ""twice as much"".

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When asked to find the height of a tower that is twice as high as a 5-meter tower, a student might guess a height that is not exactly 10 meters (e.g., 8 meters, 12 meters, etc.).
- If a recipe calls for twice as much sugar as the original amount of 2 cups, a student may not calculate the correct amount (4 cups) and instead use an incorrect amount (e.g., 3 cups, 5 cups, etc.).
- When comparing the area of two rectangles, one of which is twice as large as the other, a student may not accurately calculate the area of the larger rectangle by multiplying the dimensions by 2.
- In a real-world scenario, if a store is having a sale where everything is twice as expensive as the original price, a student may struggle to calculate the new prices of items.
- When working with measurement units, such as converting between grams and kilograms, a student may not understand that ""twice as much"" means multiplying the quantity by 2, rather than just adding a fixed amount."
311,Believes gradient is the sum of y the coordinates divided by the sum of the x co-ordinates ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient, which is a measure of how steep a line is. They may think that to find the gradient, they need to add up all the y-coordinates and divide by the sum of all the x-coordinates. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the actual formula for calculating the gradient, which involves the change in y-coordinates and the corresponding change in x-coordinates.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the gradient of a line given two points, e.g., (2,3) and (4,6). A student with this misconception may add the y-coordinates (3 + 6) and divide by the sum of the x-coordinates (2 + 4).
- When determining the gradient of a line from a table of values, where students may sum up all the y-values and divide by the sum of all the x-values.
- When comparing the steepness of two lines, where students may incorrectly calculate the gradient of each line using the sum of y-coordinates divided by the sum of x-coordinates, leading to incorrect conclusions about which line is steeper."
312,"In ratio question where the difference between the sides is given, uses that as the total for one side instead","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a ratio problem where the difference between the two parts is provided, rather than the total of one part. For instance, if a problem states that the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:5 and there are 2 more girls than boys, some students might incorrectly assume that the ""2 more"" refers to the total number of girls or boys, rather than the difference between the two. As a result, they might use this difference as the total for one side of the ratio, leading to incorrect calculations.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A recipe requires a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour. If the recipe needs 1 more cup of flour than sugar, and the student incorrectly uses the ""1 more cup"" as the total amount of sugar or flour.
- A bookshelf has a ratio of 5:7 of fiction to non-fiction books. If there are 2 more non-fiction books than fiction books, and the student incorrectly assumes the ""2 more"" is the total number of fiction or non-fiction books.
- A farmer plants a ratio of 3:4 of wheat to corn. If the farmer plants 1 more row of corn than wheat, and the student incorrectly uses the ""1 more row"" as the total number of rows of wheat or corn."
313,Believes edges of a 3D shape do not include edges of base,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the definition and properties of 3D shapes. They may think that the edges of a 3D shape only refer to the vertical or slanted edges that connect the base to the top, excluding the edges of the base itself. This misunderstanding may stem from the way students visualize or draw 3D shapes, often focusing on the height and neglecting the base.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When counting the number of edges of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a pyramid, students might only count the edges that connect the base to the top, ignoring the edges within the base.
- When asked to draw or describe the net of a 3D shape, students may omit the edges of the base, resulting in an incomplete representation.
- When calculating the perimeter of the base of a 3D shape, students may not consider the edges of the base as part of the overall edge count.
- When comparing the properties of different 3D shapes, students may incorrectly conclude that two shapes have the same number of edges because they are only considering the vertical or slanted edges."
314,"When calculating the power of a negative number, thinks they can ignore the sign when multiplying and then put a negative sign back on at the end, regardless of the power ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of exponents and powers of negative numbers. They may initially understand that a negative sign denotes the opposite of a positive number, but when it comes to calculating powers of negative numbers, they incorrectly assume that the sign can be temporarily ignored during the calculation and then simply added back at the end. This leads them to believe that the result will always be negative, regardless of the exponent.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating (-2)^4, a student might think they can ignore the negative sign, calculate 2^4 = 16, and then put a negative sign back on to get -16, which is incorrect.
- When calculating (-3)^3, a student might again ignore the negative sign, calculate 3^3 = 27, and then put a negative sign back on to get -27, which coincidentally is correct in this case, but for the wrong reasons.
- When comparing the results of (-4)^2 and 4^2, a student with this misconception might incorrectly assume that (-4)^2 will be negative, while 4^2 is positive, not realizing that the result of both calculations should be the same."
315,Has not realised that the answer may be changed by the insertion of brackets,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with mathematical expressions, particularly those involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They may not fully understand the order of operations and how the insertion of brackets can alter the way the expression is evaluated. Students with this misconception may think that the order in which operations are performed does not matter, or that brackets are only used for grouping numbers, without realizing that brackets can actually change the result of the calculation.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When evaluating expressions like 3 + 4 × 5, students may think the answer is 35 (adding 3 and 4 first) instead of 23 (multiplying 4 and 5 first).
* When given an expression like 12 - 3 + 4, students may think the answer is 9 (performing the operations from left to right) instead of 13 (following the correct order of operations).
* When working with expressions like 2 × 3 + 4, students may think the answer is 10 (multiplying 2 and 3, then adding 4) but if the expression is written as 2 × (3 + 4), the answer would be 14.
* When simplifying expressions like 18 ÷ 3 + 2, students may think the answer is 8 (dividing 18 by 3, then adding 2) but if the expression is written as 18 ÷ (3 + 2), the answer would be 3.6."
316,Mixes up primary and secondary data types,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to distinguish between primary and secondary data types in Data and Statistics. Primary data is original, firsthand data collected directly by the researcher, such as through surveys, experiments, or observations. Secondary data, on the other hand, is pre-existing data that has been collected by someone else, often found in books, articles, or online sources.

Students with this misconception may think that data from a book or website is primary data because it's the first place they encountered it, or that data they collect themselves through a survey is secondary data because it's not 'official' or published. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect analysis and interpretation of data.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A student conducts a survey of their classmates' favorite colors and thinks that the data is secondary because it's not from a published source.
* Case 2: A student uses data from a book to analyze a historical event and thinks that it's primary data because it's the first time they've seen it.
* Case 3: A student collects data on the temperature in their town over a week and thinks that it's secondary data because it's not from a 'reliable' source like a weather website."
317,"When multiplying fractions, adds the numerators and multiplies the denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the operation of multiplying fractions. They may think that multiplying fractions involves adding the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiplying the denominators (the numbers on the bottom). This is likely due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplying fractions, which actually involves multiplying the numerators and multiplying the denominators.

For example, when multiplying 1/2 and 1/3, students with this misconception may calculate the result as (1+1)/(2*3) = 2/6, instead of the correct result of (1*1)/(2*3) = 1/6.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying simple fractions, e.g., 1/2 × 1/3
- When multiplying fractions with different denominators, e.g., 2/3 × 3/4
- When solving real-world problems involving multiplying fractions, e.g., finding the area of a rectangle with fractional dimensions."
318,"Assumes that converting a decimal percentage to a fraction, they can just convert the decimal to a fraction, instead of writing the decimal over 100.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a percentage given in decimal form to a fraction. They may incorrectly assume that they can simply convert the decimal part to a fraction, forgetting that the percentage sign implies a fraction out of 100. For example, when converting 25.5% to a fraction, students with this misconception may convert 0.5 to a fraction (1/2) and then incorrectly write 25 1/2, instead of realizing that 25.5% actually means 25.5 out of 100.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Converting 0.5% to a fraction, where students may write 1/2 instead of 1/200.
- Converting 12.5% to a fraction, where students may write 12 1/2 instead of 25/200 or 1/8.
- Converting 75.25% to a fraction, where students may write 75 1/4 instead of 75.25/100 or 301/400."
319,"When factorising, thinks the smallest coefficient will be the numerical factor, regardless of whether it divides into all terms","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorisation in algebra and they mistakenly believe that the smallest coefficient in an expression will always be the numerical factor that can be factored out, without checking if it divides into all terms of the expression. They may focus solely on finding the smallest coefficient, rather than considering whether it is a common factor that can be divided out from all terms.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Factorising the expression 3x + 12y + 9, where the student may incorrectly factor out 3 without checking if it divides into all terms, when in fact, 3 is indeed a common factor in this case.
* Factorising the expression 2x + 5y + 3, where the student may incorrectly factor out 2, simply because it is the smallest coefficient, even though it does not divide into all terms.
* Factorising the expression 4x + 6y + 8, where the student may incorrectly factor out 2 or 4 without checking if it divides into all terms, when in fact, 2 is indeed a common factor in this case."
320,"When factorising into double brackets, finds the two values which sum to give the constant rather than the coefficient of x","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are attempting to factorise quadratic expressions into double brackets, typically in the form of ax^2 + bx + c. They mistakenly focus on finding two numbers that add up to the constant term (c) instead of the coefficient of the x term (b). This error shows a misunderstanding of the factorisation process, where students are supposed to find two numbers whose product is the product of the constant term and the leading coefficient, and whose sum is the coefficient of the x term.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* Factorising the expression x^2 + 7x + 12, a student might look for two numbers that add up to 12 (the constant term) instead of 7 (the coefficient of x).
* When factorising the expression x^2 + 9x + 20, a student might try to find two numbers that sum to 20 (the constant term) rather than 9 (the coefficient of x).
* Factorising the expression x^2 + 5x + 6, a student might mistakenly seek two numbers that add up to 6 (the constant term) instead of 5 (the coefficient of x)."
321,Believes class width multiplied by frequency gives frequency density,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of frequency density in data analysis. They believe that to find the frequency density, they simply need to multiply the class width by the frequency of the data within that class. However, this calculation actually gives the total number of data points within a class, not the frequency density. Frequency density is a measure that takes into account both the frequency of data and the class width, but it requires a different calculation.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating frequency density from a histogram or a grouped data set.
- When comparing the distribution of different data sets using frequency density.
- When analyzing real-life data, such as exam scores, survey results, or scientific measurements, where frequency density is used to understand the distribution of data.
- When creating or interpreting histograms, where frequency density is used to determine the height of each bar."
322,Believes that rounding must change the number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the purpose of rounding a number is to change its value. They may think that rounding always requires altering the original number, rather than understanding that rounding is a way to simplify or approximate a number, which may or may not result in a change to the original value.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a number is already a multiple of the unit being rounded to (e.g., rounding 10 to the nearest 10), and the student feels compelled to change the number, even though it's already in the desired form.
- When rounding a number that is exactly halfway between two multiples (e.g., rounding 12.5 to the nearest whole number), and the student thinks they must always round up or down, rather than considering the option of rounding to the nearest even number.
- When a number is already in a simple or exact form, but the student believes they need to round it to a different form, even if it's not necessary (e.g., rounding 5 to the nearest whole number)."
323,"When measuring a line segment with a ruler, assumes the line starts at 0","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware that the zero point on a ruler is at the edge of the ruler, not necessarily where the line segment they are measuring starts. They tend to align the starting point of the line segment with the first marking on the ruler (e.g. the 1 cm mark), rather than ensuring that the zero point on the ruler is aligned with the starting point of the line segment. As a result, they may inaccurately read off the measurement from the ruler.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When measuring the length of a room using a ruler or tape measure, a student might place the 1 cm mark of the ruler at the starting point of the room, rather than the 0 cm mark.
- When measuring the length of a line on a piece of paper, a student might align the 1 cm mark of the ruler with the starting point of the line, resulting in an incorrect measurement.
- When using a ruler to measure the length of an object, a student might not account for the gap between the zero point on the ruler and the edge of the object, leading to an inaccurate measurement."
324,Believes the two variables have to add to the same value in inverse proportion,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of inverse proportionality. They may think that for two variables to be inversely proportional, their values must add up to the same constant value. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly assume that the relationship between the variables is based on the sum of their values rather than their product.

For example, if students are given the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task, they may think that if 2 workers can complete a task in 6 hours, then 3 workers can complete it in 5 hours, and 4 workers in 4 hours, because 2 + 6 = 8, 3 + 5 = 8, and 4 + 4 = 8. However, this is not the correct way to understand inverse proportionality.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When analyzing the relationship between the number of people sharing a fixed quantity of food and the amount of food each person gets.
- When exploring the relationship between the speed of a car and the time taken to travel a fixed distance.
- When investigating the relationship between the number of tickets sold and the price of each ticket, assuming a fixed total revenue."
325,Does not check the labelling of the axes ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with graphs, particularly in Data and Statistics, and fail to verify that the x and y axes are correctly labelled. As a result, they may misinterpret the data, confuse the variables being represented, or incorrectly analyze the relationship between the variables. This oversight can lead to incorrect conclusions, misinterpretation of data trends, and a lack of understanding of the graphical representation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When creating or interpreting a graph, a student may assume the x-axis always represents time, without checking the label, and misinterpret the data as a result.
- In a line graph, a student may not notice that the y-axis represents a different unit (e.g., kilograms instead of grams) and therefore miscalculate or misinterpret the data.
- When comparing multiple graphs, a student may not verify that the axes are labelled consistently across all graphs, leading to incorrect comparisons and conclusions.
- In a real-world application, a student may be given a graph with incorrectly labelled axes (e.g., temperature on the x-axis instead of time) and fail to recognize the mistake, leading to incorrect analysis and conclusions."
326,"When converting fractions to ratios, puts the other side of the ratio as the total of the numerator and denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a ratio involves using the denominator as one part and the sum of the numerator and denominator as the other part. They incorrectly assume that the total or the whole is always the sum of the numerator and the denominator. 

For example, if a student is given the fraction 2/5 and asked to express it as a ratio, they may write it as 2:7 (2 being the numerator and 7 being the sum of the numerator and the denominator, 2 + 5). This shows a misunderstanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting the fraction 3/4 to a ratio, the student may write 3:7 instead of the correct 3:4.
- When asked to express 2/3 as a ratio, the student may write 2:5 instead of the correct 2:3.
- Given the fraction 1/2, the student may incorrectly write the ratio as 1:3 instead of the correct 1:2."
327,Mixes up total and part in ratio,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the total number of parts in a ratio and a specific part within that ratio. They may incorrectly identify or calculate the total parts as one of the parts, or vice versa, leading to errors in their calculations and problem-solving. 

For example, in a ratio of 3:5, students may confuse the total number of parts (3+5=8) with one of the parts (3 or 5). This can lead to mistakes when working with equivalent ratios, proportions, or percentage problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying ratios: When asked to simplify a ratio like 6:8, students might confuse the total (6+8=14) with one of the parts (6 or 8) and incorrectly simplify the ratio.
2. Equivalent ratios: When given a ratio like 2:3 and asked to find an equivalent ratio with a total of 10 parts, students may mix up the total and part, leading to incorrect equivalent ratios.
3. Proportional reasoning: In problems involving proportions, such as ""If it takes 3 apples to make a pie for 5 people, how many apples are needed for 8 people?"", students may confuse the total number of people (5 or 8) with the number of apples (3), leading to incorrect calculations."
328,Performs addition ahead of multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly follow the order of operations, performing addition before multiplication. In mathematical expressions, operations have a specific order of precedence, and students may struggle to remember that multiplication should be performed before addition. As a result, they may evaluate expressions by adding numbers first and then multiplying, leading to incorrect answers.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When working with simple expressions like 2 + 3 × 4, where students may add 2 and 3 first and then multiply the result by 4.
- When dealing with word problems, like ""Tom has 5 groups of 3 pencils each, and his friend gives him 2 more pencils,"" where students may add 5 and 2 first and then multiply 5 by 3.
- When evaluating expressions with multiple operations, like 10 + 2 × 5 - 3, where students may perform the addition and subtraction before the multiplication.
- When solving real-world problems, such as calculating the cost of items, where students may add the prices of items before applying discounts or taxes, which may involve multiplication."
329,Does not understand a percentage is out of 100,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend that percentages are a way of expressing a proportion or fraction of a whole as a part of 100. They may incorrectly assume that percentages can be out of any number, rather than always being out of 100. This can lead to misunderstandings when calculating percentages, interpreting percentage changes, or comparing percentages.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to find 25% of a number, a student may think it means 25 out of 50 rather than 25 out of 100.
- When comparing discounts, a student may believe that a 20% discount on a £100 item is the same as a 20% discount on a £50 item, without realizing the actual amount of the discount is different.
- When interpreting statistical data, a student may misinterpret a percentage, such as 75%, as being out of a different total, rather than out of 100.
- When calculating percentage changes, a student may incorrectly calculate the percentage increase or decrease, as they do not understand that the percentage is always out of 100."
330,"When working with inverse and direct proportion, forgets to apply the root or index to find k, but remembers when doing the second calculation","Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the concept of inverse and direct proportion and can set up the initial equation, but fail to apply the necessary mathematical operations (such as taking the root or raising to a power) to find the constant of proportionality (k). However, when using the value of k to solve a subsequent problem, they recall to apply the correct operation. 

For instance, given that y is directly proportional to the square of x (y ∝ x^2), students might set up the equation as y = kx^2 but then incorrectly calculate k by using the equation k = y/x instead of k = y/x^2.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

1. Finding the constant of proportionality in an inverse square law, such as the relationship between gravitational force and distance.
2. Determining the constant of proportionality in a direct cubic relationship, like the volume of a cube and the length of its side.
3. Solving problems involving the relationship between the area of a circle and the radius, where the constant of proportionality involves a power of the radius.
4. Calculating the constant of proportionality in an electrical resistance problem, where resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the wire."
331,Does not understand the term factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to comprehend the concept of factors in mathematics. Factors are the numbers that divide a given number exactly without leaving a remainder. Students with this misconception may think that factors are simply the numbers that can be multiplied together to get a certain number, but they do not fully grasp the idea that these numbers must divide the original number exactly.

For instance, when asked to list the factors of 12, a student with this misconception might include numbers like 5 and 3, thinking that since 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 or 5 x 2 + 2 = 12, these numbers must be factors. However, they fail to recognize that 5 does not divide 12 exactly, and therefore, it is not a factor.

This misconception can also lead students to incorrectly identify factors in various mathematical operations, such as:

- When simplifying fractions: A student might simplify a fraction like 12/8 to 5/3, thinking that 5 is a factor of 12.
- When solving algebraic equations: A student might incorrectly factor an expression like x^2 + 5x + 6, thinking that 5 is a factor.
- When working with prime factorization: A student might incorrectly identify the prime factors of a number like 24, thinking that 5 is a prime factor because it can be added to other numbers to get 24.

In general, this misconception can hinder students' understanding of various mathematical concepts that rely heavily on factors, such as equivalent ratios, proportions, and algebraic expressions."
332,Confuses reciprocal and quadratic graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the graphs of reciprocal functions (e.g., 1/x) and quadratic functions (e.g., x^2). They may incorrectly assume that both types of functions have similar graph shapes or properties. Reciprocal functions have two separate parts (asymptotes) with the curve getting closer and closer to the x and y axes but never touching them, whereas quadratic functions are continuous parabolas that can open upwards or downwards.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a function with a variable in the denominator and asked to sketch its graph, they may incorrectly draw a parabola instead of the characteristic asymptotes of a reciprocal function.
- When solving equations involving reciprocal or quadratic functions, students may apply the wrong algebraic techniques, leading to incorrect solutions.
- In problems involving function transformations, students may mistakenly apply transformations to the wrong type of function, resulting in incorrect graphs or equations.
- When analyzing real-world data, students may incorrectly model a situation with the wrong type of function, leading to inaccurate predictions or conclusions.
- When comparing the properties of different functions, students may incorrectly attribute characteristics of one type of function to another, demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of the underlying mathematical concepts."
333,Not considered the y value when reading coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to read or identify coordinates on a graph, but they only focus on the x-value and neglect or ignore the y-value. They may provide an incomplete answer by only stating the x-coordinate, or provide an incorrect answer by not properly accounting for the y-coordinate. This misconception can lead to incorrect plotting of points, misinterpretation of data, and incorrect conclusions being drawn.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the coordinates of a point on a graph, a student might respond with only the x-value (e.g., ""The point is at 3"" instead of ""The point is at (3,4)"").
- When plotting a point on a graph, a student might only consider the x-value and draw the point at the correct x-coordinate, but not at the correct y-coordinate.
- When comparing the coordinates of two points, a student might only consider the x-values and not account for differences in the y-values.
- When reading coordinates from a table or chart, a student might only focus on the x-values and not properly account for the corresponding y-values."
334,"When solving an equation with x in the denominator, thinks the inverse operation is to make it the numerator on the other side","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving equations involving fractions. They may understand that to isolate a variable, they need to perform inverse operations to ""get rid"" of the constants or coefficients attached to the variable. However, when x is in the denominator, some students mistakenly believe that the inverse operation is simply to move x to the numerator on the other side of the equation, often ignoring the fact that this would change the value of the equation. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of inverse operations, particularly when dealing with fractions and reciprocals.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Solving the equation 1/x = 2, a student might mistakenly rewrite it as x = 1/2, without considering the correct method of solving for x.
- Case 2: When given the equation 2/x = 3, a student may incorrectly think that multiplying both sides by x will simply move the x to the numerator on the other side, resulting in 2 = 3x.
- Case 3: In the equation x/4 = 5, a student with this misconception may incorrectly rewrite it as 4 = 5x, without properly inverting the fraction."
335,Believes 30% is equivalent to 1/3,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that 30% is equal to 1/3, possibly due to the idea that 30 is close to 33.33, which is the decimal representation of 1/3 when converted to a percentage (33.33%). Students might round down 33.33% to 30% and incorrectly assume they are equivalent.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Comparing discounts: A store offers a 30% discount on a product, and the student thinks it's equivalent to a 1/3 discount.
- Calculating probabilities: A student thinks an event has a 30% chance of happening and incorrectly assumes it's the same as a 1/3 chance.
- Measuring ingredients: A recipe calls for 1/3 of a cup of sugar, and the student uses 30% of a cup instead, thinking they are the same.
- Analyzing data: A student interprets data showing 30% of people prefer a certain option and incorrectly concludes that 1/3 of the people prefer that option.
- Solving algebraic equations: An equation involves percentages, and the student incorrectly converts 30% to 1/3, leading to incorrect solutions."
336,Does not understand that having values after the decimal point makes a number larger than a number with the same units but no decimal places,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to grasp the concept of decimal places and their impact on the magnitude of a number. They may believe that the presence of decimal places somehow makes the number smaller or irrelevant, rather than understanding that it represents a more precise value.

For example, when comparing the numbers 5 and 5.3, students with this misconception may think that 5 is larger or equal to 5.3 because they don't fully comprehend the significance of the decimal point. They might overlook the fact that 5.3 represents a value greater than 5 due to the additional 0.3.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

* Comparing measurements (e.g., 10m vs. 10.5m)
* Ordering numbers in ascending or descending order (e.g., 3, 3.1, 3.2)
* Performing arithmetic operations involving decimals (e.g., 2 + 0.5)
* Interpreting data or statistics that involve decimal values (e.g., average scores or temperatures)
* Solving problems involving money or currency that require an understanding of decimal places (e.g., £5 vs. £5.50)"
337,Believes the solution of mx + c = a is x =a,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a superficial understanding of linear equations and how to solve them. They may have learned that the goal is to isolate the variable (in this case, x), but they don't fully grasp the concept of inverse operations and how to apply them correctly. They might mistakenly assume that to solve for x, they simply need to remove the constant term (c) and the coefficient of x (m), without performing the necessary inverse operations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When the value of m is close to 1 or -1, making it seem like the coefficient of x can be ignored.
- When the value of c is 0, making it seem like the equation is simply mx = a, and x = a is a plausible solution.
- When students are solving a series of simple equations where the coefficient of x is 1, and they mistakenly apply the same logic to more complex equations.
- When students are under time pressure or lack confidence in their math abilities, leading them to make hasty or uninformed decisions."
338,Believes only straight lines count as edges on 3D shapes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the definition of an edge in 3D shapes. They may believe that only straight lines can form edges, and curved lines or other shapes cannot. This can lead to difficulties in identifying and counting edges in 3D shapes that have curved or non-linear features.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When counting the edges of a cylinder, students may only count the straight lines at the top and bottom, ignoring the curved lateral edge.
- When identifying the edges of a sphere, students may not recognize any edges at all, as a sphere does not have straight lines.
- When working with more complex 3D shapes, such as a hemisphere or a cone, students may struggle to identify and count the edges due to their curved nature."
339,"When dividing, ignores any remainders","Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that remainders are irrelevant or unimportant when dividing numbers. They may think that the remainder can simply be ignored or discarded, rather than being a crucial part of the division process. As a result, they may only focus on the quotient (result of the division) and neglect to consider the remainder.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When dividing a set of objects into equal groups, students may ignore any leftovers and just report the number of full groups.
- When solving division word problems, students may disregard any remainders and only provide the quotient as the solution.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for cooking or building materials, ignoring remainders can lead to inaccurate calculations and potentially affect the final outcome.
- When dividing numbers in a mathematical problem, students may simply drop any remainders and move on to the next step, without considering the implications of the remainder on the overall solution."
340,Does not understand that when multiplying both sides of an equation by an amount every term must be multiplied by the same amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that when multiplying both sides of an equation by a certain value, every term within the equation must be multiplied by that same value to maintain the equation's balance. This misunderstanding often leads students to incorrectly apply the multiplication, resulting in an unbalanced equation.

For instance, given the equation 2x + 3 = 5, if a student wants to eliminate the coefficient of x by multiplying both sides by 1/2, they may incorrectly multiply only the 2x term, resulting in (1/2)2x + 3 = (1/2)5, instead of correctly multiplying all terms: (1/2)2x + (1/2)3 = (1/2)5.

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: When solving linear equations, students may forget to multiply the constant term, leading to incorrect solutions.
- Case 2: In algebraic manipulations, students may incorrectly simplify expressions by not applying the multiplication to all terms, resulting in incorrect expansions or factorizations.
- Case 3: When working with ratios or proportions, students may fail to multiply all parts of the ratio or proportion, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- Case 4: In problem-solving situations, such as calculating the cost of goods or the area of a room, students may not apply the multiplication correctly, resulting in incorrect answers."
341,Believes the second term in a 2 term quadratic equation is always a coefficient and the variable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to quadratic equations in the form of ax^2 + bx + c. They may assume that the second term (bx) always has a coefficient (b) multiplied by the variable (x). However, students may overlook the fact that the coefficient can be 1, and in some cases, the variable may be the only component of the second term.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying quadratic expressions, students may incorrectly assume that a coefficient is always present, leading to errors in simplification.
- When comparing or adding quadratic equations, students may misinterpret the absence of a coefficient as an error, rather than recognizing that the coefficient is 1.
- When factoring quadratic expressions, students may struggle to identify the correct factors if they are expecting a coefficient to be present in the second term.
- When solving quadratic equations, students may incorrectly apply formulas or methods due to their assumption about the second term's structure."
342,Uses the whole base rather than half the base when forming a right angled triangle from an isosceles triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with isosceles triangles and are required to find the area or height of the triangle. They incorrectly assume that when forming a right-angled triangle from the isosceles triangle, they should use the whole base of the isosceles triangle rather than half of it. This can lead to incorrect calculations and an overestimation of the area or height.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of an isosceles triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle (1/2 * base * height), and mistakenly using the full base of the isosceles triangle to form the right-angled triangle.
- When calculating the height of an isosceles triangle using the Pythagorean theorem and incorrectly using the full base as the base of the right-angled triangle.
- When splitting an isosceles triangle into two right-angled triangles and mistakenly using the full base to find the height or area of each right-angled triangle.
- When dealing with word problems that involve isosceles triangles, such as finding the area of a roof or the height of a building, and incorrectly applying the whole base rather than half the base."
343,Estimates the frequency shown on a pie chart rather than calculating,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are interpreting data presented in a pie chart. Instead of accurately calculating the frequency or proportion of a particular category, they make an estimate based on the visual representation. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions, especially if the differences between categories are subtle or if the student lacks experience in reading pie charts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is analyzing a pie chart showing the favorite colors of a class of 30 students. The chart appears to show that about a quarter of the chart is blue, so the student estimates that 8 students chose blue as their favorite color, without calculating the actual number.
2. In a survey, a pie chart displays the proportion of people who prefer different types of music. A student looks at the chart and estimates that about half of the people surveyed prefer pop music, without checking the actual percentages or frequencies.
3. A student is comparing the sales of different products using a pie chart. They estimate that Product A accounts for about a third of the sales, based on the size of the slice, without calculating the actual sales figures.
4. A student is analyzing a pie chart showing the distribution of exam scores. They estimate that about 20% of the students scored above 80%, based on the size of the corresponding slice, without checking the actual numbers."
344,Does not understand that a probability of 0 represents something that is impossible,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the concept of probability, specifically the idea that a probability of 0 signifies an impossible event. They may interpret 0 as simply ""not happening"" or ""unlikely,"" rather than understanding that it represents a situation that cannot occur under any circumstances. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly assign probabilities or misinterpret the results of probability calculations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the probability of an event that is impossible by definition, such as rolling a 7 on a standard six-sided die.
- When analyzing the probability of an event that is theoretically impossible, such as drawing a square circle.
- When considering the probability of an event that is practically impossible, such as randomly guessing a complex password on the first attempt.
- When determining the probability of an event that is defined as impossible by the problem constraints, such as a coin landing on its edge when flipped.
- When encountering a situation where the probability of an event is mathematically calculated to be 0, but the student does not fully grasp the implications of this result."
345,Has treated this like an addition problem and added the ones column.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of place value in a mathematical operation, typically subtraction or other multi-digit calculations, and instead apply the rules of addition. They may incorrectly add the numbers in the ones column, ignoring the fact that the operation requires a different calculation, such as subtracting or regrouping. This misconception reveals a lack of understanding of the relationship between place value and mathematical operations.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting multi-digit numbers, e.g., 45 - 27, where the student adds the ones column (5 + 7) instead of subtracting.
- Performing calculations with regrouping, e.g., 56 - 39, where the student adds the ones column (6 + 9) instead of regrouping the tens column.
- Solving word problems that involve multi-digit calculations, e.g., ""Tom has 56 pencils and gives 27 to his friend. How many pencils does Tom have left?"" where the student adds the numbers instead of subtracting."
346,Does not understand how to multiply algebraic terms,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to apply the rules of multiplication to algebraic expressions. They may incorrectly multiply variables and constants, or fail to recognize that multiplying variables with the same base results in adding the exponents. For instance, students may think that 'x * x' is '2x' instead of 'x^2', or '2x * 3x' is '5x' instead of '6x^2'.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying two variables with the same base (e.g., 'x * x' or 'x^2 * x^3')
- When multiplying a variable with a constant (e.g., '2x * 3')
- When multiplying two binomials (e.g., '(x + 2) * (x + 3)')
- When expanding expressions with multiple terms (e.g., '(x + 2) * (x^2 + 3x - 1)')
- When solving quadratic equations or polynomial expressions."
347,"When solving an equation with a fraction, thinks you don't need to multiply every term on both sides when multiplying by the denominator ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with equations that involve fractions. They may believe that when multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator to eliminate the fraction, they only need to multiply the term containing the fraction, rather than every term on both sides of the equation. This can lead to incorrect solutions and a lack of understanding of the fundamental principle of equivalence in algebra, where any operation applied to one side of an equation must also be applied to the other side.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving the equation 1/2x + 3 = 5, a student might multiply only 1/2x by 2, resulting in x + 3 = 10, rather than multiplying every term by 2 to get x + 6 = 10.
- In the equation 2/3x - 2 = 4, a student may multiply only 2/3x by 3, getting 2x - 2 = 12, instead of multiplying every term by 3 to get 2x - 6 = 12.
- When dealing with the equation 3/4x + 2 = 7, a student might only multiply 3/4x by 4, resulting in 3x + 2 = 28, rather than multiplying every term by 4 to get 3x + 8 = 28."
348,Writes times in the afternoon as if 10 is midday on a 24 hour clock,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are transitioning from a 12-hour clock to a 24-hour clock. They may understand that the 24-hour clock starts from 00:00 and ends at 23:59, but they incorrectly assume that the afternoon hours start counting from 10:00 instead of 12:00. As a result, they may write times in the afternoon with an incorrect hour value, thinking that 10 represents midday.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to convert 2 pm to a 24-hour clock, a student might write 10:00 instead of 14:00.
* If a student is told that a school event starts at 3 pm, they might record it as 11:00 on a 24-hour schedule instead of the correct time, 15:00.
* When solving a problem involving time calculations, a student with this misconception might calculate the time 4 hours after 12 pm as 16:00 - 4 = 10:00 (thinking that 10 represents midday) instead of the correct calculation, 12:00 + 4 hours = 16:00."
349,"When adding surds, just multiplies the numbers under the surd rather than first trying to simplifying to find like surds","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with the addition of surds, which are expressions containing square roots. They mistakenly believe that adding surds involves simply multiplying the numbers under the radical sign, rather than first trying to simplify the surds to find like terms. 

For example, when adding √12 and √27, students with this misconception may incorrectly multiply the numbers under the surd (12 and 27) and then put the result under a square root, rather than first simplifying √12 and √27 into like surds (e.g., 2√3 and 3√3). This misunderstanding demonstrates a lack of understanding of the properties of surds and the importance of simplifying expressions before attempting to add them.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Adding √8 and √18, where students may multiply 8 and 18 instead of simplifying to 2√2 and 3√2.
- Adding √50 and √72, where students may multiply 50 and 72 instead of simplifying to 5√2 and 6√2.
- Adding √24 and √48, where students may multiply 24 and 48 instead of simplifying to 2√6 and 4√6."
350,Forgets to carry the tens when doing column multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students perform column multiplication and fail to carry over the tens digit from one column to the next. In column multiplication, each column represents a place value (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.), and when multiplying numbers, it is essential to carry over any tens digits that result from multiplying numbers in one column to the next column. If students forget to do this, they will end up with an incorrect product.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Multiplying multi-digit numbers, e.g., 43 × 27
* Multiplying numbers with multiple digits in the tens or hundreds place, e.g., 147 × 35
* Performing multiplication with regrouping, e.g., 94 × 76
* Solving word problems that involve multiplication of multi-digit numbers, e.g., ""A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 43 books. How many books can the bookshelf hold in total?"""
351,Thinks a chord does not have to start and end at the circumference of the circle.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of a chord in a circle. They may think that any line segment that intersects the circle can be considered a chord, regardless of where it starts and ends. In their understanding, a chord can start inside the circle, on the circumference, or even outside the circle, as long as it intersects the circle at some point.

This misconception can lead students to identify any line segment that crosses the circle as a chord, without considering the crucial property that a chord must start and end at the circumference.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When drawing a diagram of a circle with intersecting lines, students may label any line segment that intersects the circle as a chord, without checking where it starts and ends.
- When solving problems involving circles, students may incorrectly identify a line segment as a chord, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- When asked to identify the different parts of a circle (e.g., radius, diameter, chord, tangent), students may incorrectly label a line segment that does not start and end at the circumference as a chord."
352,Believes the fx column for calculating mean is value - frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean from a frequency table. They incorrectly assume that the fx column, which represents the product of the value and its frequency, is calculated by subtracting the frequency from the value instead of multiplying them together. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and ultimately an incorrect mean value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the mean from a frequency table, a student may write 5 - 3 in the fx column instead of 5 x 3, where 5 is the value and 3 is the frequency.
- In a data set with a value of 10 and a frequency of 4, a student with this misconception may calculate the fx value as 10 - 4 = 6 instead of 10 x 4 = 40.
- When finding the mean of exam scores, a student might subtract the number of students who scored a certain mark from the mark itself, rather than multiplying the score by the number of students."
353,Does not recognise when one part of a fraction is the negative of the other,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to identify that one part of a fraction is the negative of the other, often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the numerator and denominator in fractions. This can lead to incorrect simplification, comparison, or arithmetic operations involving fractions. Students might treat the negative sign as a separate entity rather than considering it as part of the fraction.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions, students may not recognize that a negative numerator and a positive denominator (or vice versa) can be simplified to a negative fraction with a positive numerator and denominator (e.g., -3/4 is the same as 3/-4, which is the same as -3/4, but not the same as 3/4).
- When comparing fractions, students might not understand that a fraction with a negative numerator or denominator can be less than or greater than a fraction with positive numerator and denominator (e.g., comparing -1/2 and 1/2).
- When performing arithmetic operations involving fractions, students may not correctly apply the rules for operating with negative fractions (e.g., adding or subtracting fractions with negative numerators or denominators).
- When solving algebraic equations or inequalities involving fractions, students may not recognize the impact of negative signs on the solution (e.g., solving the equation -x/2 = 3)."
354,Believes class width represents frequency in a histogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the width of a class or bin in a histogram represents the frequency or number of data points within that class, rather than understanding that the height of the bar (or area of the bar) represents the frequency. 

They may think that a wider class width means more data points are included in that class, rather than recognizing that class width is a way to group data points within a certain range of values. This can lead to incorrect interpretations of the data and a lack of understanding of how histograms are used to display and analyze data distributions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When students are asked to create a histogram with non-uniform class widths, they may incorrectly assume that the wider classes have more data points.
2. When comparing two histograms with different class widths, students may mistakenly conclude that the histogram with wider classes has more data points overall.
3. When analyzing a histogram with a large range of values, students may incorrectly assume that the classes with wider widths are more important or have more significance than those with narrower widths."
355,Thinks the interior angle of a regular polygon is 10n,"Explanation: This misconception suggests that students mistakenly believe that the interior angle of a regular polygon can be calculated by simply multiplying the number of sides (n) by 10. This incorrect formula is overly simplistic and does not take into account the actual relationship between the number of sides of a polygon and the measure of its interior angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to the concept of interior angles of polygons and are trying to come up with a simple rule to remember.
- When students are given a regular polygon with a small number of sides (e.g., a triangle or a square) and they notice that the interior angle is close to 10 times the number of sides, leading them to incorrectly generalize this pattern to all polygons.
- When students are under time pressure or lack confidence in their math abilities, leading them to rely on an overly simplistic and incorrect formula rather than taking the time to learn and apply the correct one."
356,Finds the sum of the missing angles but not the angle being asked,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a specific missing angle in a shape, but instead of finding that particular angle, they find the sum of all the missing angles. This shows a lack of understanding of the question being asked and the concept of angles in shapes. Students may be able to calculate the total sum of the missing angles correctly, but they fail to identify the specific angle being asked.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. In a triangle, angles A and B are given, and the student is asked to find angle C. Instead of finding angle C, the student finds the sum of angles A and B, or finds the sum of all three angles (which is 180 degrees) and doesn't isolate angle C.

2. In a quadrilateral, three angles are given, and the student is asked to find the fourth angle. Instead of finding the fourth angle, the student finds the sum of all four angles (which is 360 degrees) and doesn't isolate the fourth angle.

3. In a problem involving intersecting lines, a student is asked to find a specific angle. Instead of finding that angle, the student finds the sum of all the angles formed by the intersecting lines."
357,Does not understand that in the ratio 1:n the total number of parts would be 1+n ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that the ratio 1:n represents a total of 1 + n parts, rather than just n parts. They may interpret the ratio as only having n parts, ignoring the initial '1' part. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations in various mathematical contexts, such as proportions, fractions, and equivalent ratios.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Sharing sweets: If a student is given a ratio of 1:3 for sharing sweets with their friends, they might think there are only 3 parts in total, rather than 4 (1 part for themselves and 3 parts for their friends).
2. Mixing paint: In a paint-mixing problem with a ratio of 1:5 (1 part blue paint to 5 parts red paint), students with this misconception may think there are only 5 parts of paint in total, instead of 6 (1 part blue + 5 parts red).
3. Scaling recipes: When scaling a recipe with a ratio of 1:2 (1 cup of flour to 2 cups of sugar), students may incorrectly assume there are only 2 cups in total, rather than 3 (1 cup flour + 2 cups sugar)."
358,Believes digits of a number are read/written from right to left,"Explanation: This misconception involves students believing that when reading or writing numbers, the digits should be considered from right to left. This misunderstanding may stem from various sources, such as prior exposure to certain languages that are read from right to left, or an incorrect initial understanding of place value. As a result, students may mistakenly reverse the order of digits in a number.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

- When writing a multi-digit number: A student may write the number 456 as 654.
- When reading a multi-digit number: A student may read the number 123 as ""321"".
- When performing arithmetic operations: A student may perform calculations with reversed numbers, such as adding 45 and 27 as 54 + 72.
- When solving word problems: A student may misinterpret the numbers in a word problem and use reversed digits, leading to incorrect solutions."
359,Confuses random and stratified sampling methods,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that random sampling and stratified sampling are the same or that they can be used interchangeably. Students may think that as long as a sample is selected randomly, it doesn't matter if the population is divided into subgroups or not. They may also believe that a stratified sample is simply a random sample with some added complexity, rather than understanding that it's a deliberate attempt to ensure that the sample represents the population's subgroups.

This misconception can lead to students incorrectly applying sampling methods, which can result in biased or unrepresentative samples. For example, they might use a random sampling method when they should use a stratified sampling method to ensure that specific subgroups are represented.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to design a sampling method to determine the average height of students in a school. They decide to randomly select 100 students, without considering the different age groups or genders, which may lead to an unrepresentative sample.
- Case 2: A student is conducting a survey to determine the most popular hobby among people in a city. They randomly select 500 people from the phone book, without considering the different ethnic or socio-economic groups in the city, which may lead to biased results.
- Case 3: A student is asked to investigate the effect of a new fertilizer on plant growth. They randomly select 20 plants from a greenhouse, without considering the different types of plants or soil conditions, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions."
360,Gives frequency when asked for relative frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the relative frequency of a data set but instead provide the frequency. Relative frequency refers to the proportion or percentage of times a particular value or category occurs in a data set, while frequency simply refers to the number of times it occurs. Students with this misconception may be able to count the number of occurrences of each value or category but fail to take the extra step of dividing by the total number of data points to find the relative frequency.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When asked to create a histogram with relative frequencies, a student might label the y-axis with frequency counts instead of proportions or percentages.
- When calculating the probability of an event, a student might provide the number of times the event occurs instead of dividing that number by the total number of trials.
- When comparing the distribution of different data sets, a student might focus on the frequency counts rather than the relative frequencies, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When interpreting the results of a survey, a student might report the number of respondents who selected a particular answer instead of the proportion of respondents who selected that answer."
361,Believes that repeated prime factors are only counted once,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of prime factorization. They may believe that when a prime factor appears multiple times in the factorization of a number, it is only counted once. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental concept of prime factorization, which requires counting the number of times each prime factor appears.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the prime factorization of a number, such as 8, where the student may write 2 instead of 2^3.
- When simplifying fractions or rational expressions, where repeated prime factors in the numerator or denominator are not fully accounted for.
- When comparing the prime factorizations of different numbers, where students may incorrectly conclude that two numbers have the same prime factorization because they have not accounted for repeated factors.
- When solving problems involving the least common multiple (LCM) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers, where repeated prime factors play a crucial role in determining the correct answer."
362,Believes f(x) - a translates the function right a units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of subtracting a constant 'a' from the function f(x). They believe that subtracting 'a' from the function shifts the graph of f(x) to the right by 'a' units. However, this is not the case. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Graphing functions: When students are asked to graph a function f(x) - a, they might incorrectly shift the original graph of f(x) to the right by 'a' units instead of shifting it down by 'a' units.
- Transformations of functions: When exploring transformations of functions, such as translations, students may mistakenly believe that f(x) - a represents a horizontal translation, rather than a vertical translation.
- Analyzing the effects of constants: In more complex functions, students may struggle to understand how the constant 'a' affects the graph, leading them to incorrectly conclude that it causes a rightward shift."
363,Only applies a division to one of multiple terms in a numerator when simplifying an algebraic fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying algebraic fractions and they incorrectly apply division to only one term in the numerator, rather than the entire numerator. They may cancel out a common factor between the numerator and the denominator, but fail to divide the remaining terms in the numerator by that same factor. This can result in an incorrect simplified fraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Simplifying the fraction (2x + 4) / 2, students may divide only the 4 by 2, resulting in (2x + 2) instead of dividing the entire numerator by 2, which would result in x + 2.

- Case 2: Simplifying the fraction (6x + 12) / 3, students may divide only the 12 by 3, resulting in (6x + 4) instead of dividing the entire numerator by 3, which would result in 2x + 4.

- Case 3: Simplifying the fraction (9x + 15) / 3, students may divide only the 15 by 3, resulting in (9x + 5) instead of dividing the entire numerator by 3, which would result in 3x + 5."
364,Thinks they just remove the decimal point when converting a decimal to a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a decimal to a percentage. They mistakenly believe that simply removing the decimal point will give them the correct percentage. For example, they might think that 0.25 becomes 25, which is correct in this case but this is not the correct method. They fail to understand the actual process of converting decimals to percentages, which involves multiplying the decimal by 100. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Converting 0.5 to a percentage, where students might simply write 5 instead of the correct 50%.
- Converting 0.07 to a percentage, where students might simply write 7 instead of the correct 7%.
- Converting 1.25 to a percentage, where students might simply write 125 instead of the correct 125%."
365,Thinks that we cannot calculate the range if values are repeated,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the range of a set of data can only be calculated if all the values are distinct. They may think that if there are repeated values, the range is undefined or cannot be determined. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the definition of range, which is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a dataset contains multiple modes, and students believe that the repeated values affect the calculation of the range.
- When students are asked to calculate the range of a dataset that includes repeated values, and they think that the repetition of values makes it impossible to determine the range.
- When comparing the ranges of two datasets, one with repeated values and one without, and students believe that the range can only be calculated for the dataset without repeated values."
366,Does not know the meaning of the identity symbol,"Explanation: The identity symbol (=) is often misunderstood by students who may think it means ""makes"" or ""leads to"" rather than ""is equal to"" or ""has the same value as"". This misconception can lead students to believe that the equation is a process of getting from one side to the other, rather than a statement of equivalence between two expressions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving simple equations, a student might think that the equation 2x = 6 means that 2x ""makes"" 6, rather than 2x is equal to 6.
- When simplifying expressions, a student might think that the expression 3x = 3 × x means that the multiplication is necessary to get the ""answer"", rather than recognizing that 3x is already equal to 3 × x.
- When solving algebraic equations, a student might perform operations to ""get rid"" of a variable, without realizing that these operations are only valid if they are applied to both sides of the equation to maintain equality."
367,Does not know that co-interior angles must be in parallel lines,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize that co-interior angles can only be formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines. They may mistakenly believe that any pair of angles on the same side of a transversal line are co-interior angles, regardless of whether the lines intersected by the transversal are parallel or not.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a diagram of two lines intersected by a transversal line and asked to identify the co-interior angles, they may incorrectly identify angles that are not formed by parallel lines.
- When students are given a problem involving the sum of co-interior angles, they may incorrectly apply the rule that co-interior angles add up to 180 degrees to non-parallel lines.
- When students are asked to solve problems involving angles in a diagram with multiple lines and transversals, they may fail to recognize which lines are parallel and which angles are truly co-interior angles."
368,Thinks a kite has one pair of parallel sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a kite, a type of quadrilateral, has one pair of parallel sides, similar to a trapezoid or a parallelogram. However, a kite actually has two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length, but not necessarily parallel. This misconception may stem from the fact that kites are often introduced alongside other quadrilaterals with parallel sides, leading students to incorrectly generalize this characteristic to kites.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the characteristics of a kite, a student might say that it has one pair of parallel sides.
- When given a diagram of a kite and asked to label its properties, a student might incorrectly label two sides as parallel.
- When solving a problem that involves determining the perimeter or area of a kite, a student might assume that the parallel sides (which don't actually exist) can be used to simplify the calculation."
369,Forgets to add starting value when calculating new coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with translations or movements of objects on a coordinate grid, particularly in the context of geometry. When an object is moved a certain number of units in the x or y direction, students may forget to add the starting value of the original coordinate to the translation value to find the new coordinate.

For example, if a point starts at (3, 4) and is translated 2 units to the right and 1 unit up, some students may incorrectly calculate the new coordinates as (2, 1) instead of adding the translation values to the starting coordinates, resulting in the correct new coordinates of (5, 5).

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Translating a point on a coordinate grid
- Moving an object a certain distance on a map or chart
- Calculating the new position of an object after a series of movements
- Determining the coordinates of a shape after a translation or reflection
- Solving problems involving movement and direction in real-world contexts, such as navigation or game development."
370,"When solving simultaneous equations, believes the terms must have the same sign in order to be eliminated.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that in order to eliminate a variable when solving simultaneous equations, the coefficients of that variable must have the same sign (both positive or both negative) in both equations. They mistakenly believe that if the signs are different (one positive and one negative), the variables cannot be eliminated.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Case 1: When solving the simultaneous equations 2x + 3y = 5 and -2x + 4y = 7, a student may believe that the x terms cannot be eliminated because they have opposite signs.
* Case 2: When solving the simultaneous equations x - 2y = 3 and 3x + 2y = 9, a student may think that the y terms cannot be eliminated because one is positive and the other is negative.
* Case 3: When solving the simultaneous equations 4x + 5y = 11 and -4x - 2y = -8, a student may mistakenly believe that the x terms must be made to have the same sign before they can be eliminated."
371,"When dividing fractions, divides by the reciprocal, instead of multiplies","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing fractions. They may mistakenly believe that to divide one fraction by another, they need to divide the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second fraction, and vice versa, effectively dividing by the reciprocal. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the division process and the properties of fractions.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When dividing two simple fractions, such as 1/2 ÷ 1/3, students may write (1 ÷ 1) / (2 ÷ 3) instead of multiplying by the reciprocal.
- When solving word problems involving division of fractions, such as ""If you have 1/2 of a pizza and you want to share it equally among 1/3 of your friends, how much pizza will each friend get?"", students may apply the incorrect division method.
- When simplifying complex fractions, such as (1/2) / (3/4), students may attempt to divide the numerators and denominators separately instead of multiplying by the reciprocal."
372,"In ratio question where the difference between the sides is given, uses that as the total","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a ratio problem where they are provided with the difference between the parts, rather than the total. Instead of using the difference as a means to set up an equation or proportion, they mistakenly assume that the difference is the total. 

For example, if a problem states that the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4, and there are 2 more girls than boys, some students may assume that the total number of students is 2 (the difference), rather than using the ratio and the difference to set up an equation to find the actual total number of students.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A recipe for making cookies calls for a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour. If 150g more flour is needed than sugar, a student may think that the total amount of ingredients needed is 150g.
- A car travels 250 miles in a ratio of 3:5 of hours driven on the highway to hours driven on city roads. If it spends 2 more hours on city roads than on the highway, a student may assume that the total hours driven is 2 hours.
- A bag contains a ratio of 4:7 of red to blue marbles. If there are 3 more blue marbles than red marbles, a student may think that the total number of marbles is 3."
373,Believes you can add or subtract from inside brackets without expanding when solving an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can directly add or subtract terms from inside brackets without properly expanding or distributing the terms. They might think that they can simply ""move"" terms in or out of the brackets, treating the brackets as a kind of ""container"" that doesn't affect the terms inside. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect simplifications and solutions when working with algebraic expressions and equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When simplifying expressions like 2(x + 3) - 5, a student might incorrectly think they can simply subtract 5 from inside the brackets, resulting in 2(x - 2).
* When solving equations like x + 2(3x - 1) = 10, a student might mistakenly add or subtract terms from inside the brackets without properly distributing the 2, leading to incorrect solutions.
* When working with more complex expressions like (x + 2)(x - 3) + 4, a student might incorrectly try to add or subtract terms from inside one or both sets of brackets without properly expanding the product."
374,Thinks a hexagon has 8 sides.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty in identifying and recalling the properties of different polygons, specifically a hexagon. They may be confusing a hexagon with an octagon, which actually has 8 sides. This misconception could be due to a lack of exposure to various geometric shapes, insufficient practice in identifying and naming polygons, or a misunderstanding of the prefix ""hexa-"" which means 6.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to draw and label a hexagon, the student draws an 8-sided shape.
- When asked to identify the number of sides of a hexagon, the student responds with 8.
- When solving a problem involving the perimeter of a hexagon, the student uses 8 sides instead of 6 to calculate the perimeter.
- When completing a geometry worksheet, the student consistently identifies hexagons as having 8 sides instead of 6."
375,Believes you can only have one mode,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a dataset can only have one mode, which is the value that appears most frequently. They may think that having multiple modes is not possible or is an error. In reality, a dataset can be bimodal, trimodal, or even multimodal, where two or more values appear with the same frequency, making them all modes.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is analyzing the scores of a class test and finds that both 75 and 80 appear 5 times, which is more than any other score. The student might incorrectly conclude that there is no mode or that only one of these scores is the mode.

- Case 2: A student is examining the number of hours spent watching TV per week and finds that both 2 hours and 4 hours appear 10 times, which is the highest frequency. The student might mistakenly choose only one of these values as the mode.

- Case 3: A student is looking at the favorite colors of students in a class and finds that both blue and green are chosen by 8 students, which is more than any other color. The student might incorrectly assume that only one of these colors is the mode."
376,Unable to equate a division and multiplication to a single division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the relationship between division and multiplication, particularly when simplifying complex fractions or equivalent ratios. They may not recognize that dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal. As a result, they fail to simplify expressions by equating a division and multiplication to a single division, which can lead to unnecessary calculations and incorrect answers.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying a complex fraction: 12 ÷ (3/4) 
   - Students may not recognize that this can be simplified to 12 × (4/3) or a single division 12 ÷ 3 × 4.

2. Equivalent ratios: 9 ÷ (3/2) 
   - Students may not understand that this can be rewritten as 9 × (2/3) or a single division 9 ÷ 3 × 2.

3. Real-world problems: If 3 groups of 4 friends want to share some candy equally, and there are 12 candies in total, how many candies will each friend get?
   - Students may not recognize that dividing the total candies (12) by the number of groups (3) and then multiplying by the number of friends in each group (4) is equivalent to a single division 12 ÷ (3/4)."
377,"When asked for the mean of a list of data, gives the mode","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the mean of a dataset but instead, they identify and provide the mode, which is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. The students may get confused between the different measures of central tendency, which include the mean, median, and mode. They may incorrectly assume that the most frequently occurring value (mode) represents the average value (mean) of the dataset. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with a dataset that has a clear mode, but the numbers are not evenly distributed, making the mean and mode significantly different.
- When working with a small dataset where the mode is easily identifiable, but the mean requires calculation.
- When analyzing categorical data where the mode is often used, but the question specifically asks for the mean, which may not be applicable.
- When solving word problems that involve finding the average of a set of numbers, but the student mistakenly identifies the mode as the answer."
378,"When finding the difference between two points on a time series graph, only uses one of the points. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the difference or change between two points on a time series graph. Instead of correctly calculating the difference by subtracting the values of the two points, students with this misconception will only consider one of the points, often the starting or ending point. They may ignore the other point entirely or fail to understand the need to compare the two values.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* A student is asked to find the difference in temperature between Monday and Friday on a graph showing the daily temperature for a week. They might only look at the temperature on Friday and report that as the answer.
* A student is asked to find the change in sales over a period of time on a graph showing monthly sales figures. They might only consider the sales figure for the first or last month and fail to calculate the difference.
* A student is asked to find the difference in the number of hours of sunshine between two consecutive days on a graph showing the daily hours of sunshine for a month. They might only look at the hours of sunshine for one of the days and not calculate the difference."
379,Finds the y intercept when asked to read the solution to a quadratic equation from a graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the solutions or roots of a quadratic equation from a graph, but instead, they identify and report the y-intercept. The y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis, which represents the value of the function when the input (x) is zero. However, the solutions or roots of a quadratic equation are the x-values where the graph intersects the x-axis, indicating the points where the function's value is zero. Students with this misconception may focus solely on the y-intercept, failing to recognize that the roots of the equation are the x-intercepts.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A student is given the graph of a quadratic equation y = x^2 - 4x - 3 and is asked to find the solutions. Instead of identifying the x-intercepts, they report the y-intercept, which is -3.
2. When asked to solve the quadratic equation x^2 + 2x - 6 = 0 using a graph, a student incorrectly identifies the y-intercept as the solution, rather than looking for the x-intercepts.
3. A student is given a graph with multiple x-intercepts and is asked to find the solutions of the corresponding quadratic equation. However, they mistakenly focus on the y-intercept, which is not relevant to solving the equation."
380,Does not understand the first significant value is the first non-zero digit number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify the first significant figure in a given number, mistakenly thinking that it can be a zero. They may believe that the first significant figure is simply the first digit, regardless of whether it's zero or not. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect rounding or truncation of numbers, affecting calculations and measurements in various areas of mathematics and science.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Rounding numbers to a specified number of significant figures, where students may incorrectly include leading zeros as significant figures.
- Identifying the number of significant figures in a measurement, where students may mistakenly count leading zeros, affecting the precision of the measurement.
- Performing calculations involving significant figures, where students may incorrectly round or truncate numbers due to their misunderstanding of the first significant figure.
- Comparing the precision of different measurements, where students may incorrectly assess the reliability of measurements based on their incorrect understanding of significant figures."
381,"When dividing a fraction by an integer, divides both the numerator and denominator by the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer and they incorrectly apply the rule for dividing fractions by fractions. They may assume that they can simply divide both the numerator and denominator by the integer, thinking it will give them the correct result. However, this approach neglects the fact that when dividing by an integer, we are essentially asking how many times the divisor fits into the dividend, and the operation should be treated as a multiplication by the reciprocal of the divisor.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- 1/2 ÷ 3, where students might incorrectly divide both the numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in 1/6 ÷ 1, which is not the correct approach.
- 3/4 ÷ 2, where students may incorrectly divide both the numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in 3/2 ÷ 1 or 3/2, which is also incorrect.
- 2/3 ÷ 4, where students might incorrectly divide both the numerator and denominator by 4, which would lead to an incorrect result."
382,Does not know how to combine different symbols in Roman numerals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand the rules governing the combination of Roman numerals, particularly the additive and subtractive principles. Roman numerals use a combination of letters to represent certain numbers, and the position of these letters can change the value of the number. Students may struggle to grasp how to combine these letters to represent larger numbers, often leading to incorrect calculations.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When trying to write numbers that are a combination of tens and ones, such as 14 (XIV) or 19 (XIX), where students might incorrectly write the numerals as XIIV or XIXX.
- When representing numbers that involve subtracting one Roman numeral from another, such as 4 (IV) or 9 (IX), where students might incorrectly write the numerals as IIII or VIIII.
- When trying to write larger numbers that involve a combination of hundreds, tens, and ones, such as 234 (CCXXXIV), where students might get the order or combination of the numerals incorrect."
383,confuses cubic and reciprocal graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the graphs of cubic functions (e.g., y = x^3) and reciprocal functions (e.g., y = 1/x). They may incorrectly identify the key features of these graphs, such as the shape, asymptotes, and intercepts. For example, students may mistakenly think that a cubic graph has a horizontal asymptote or that a reciprocal graph has an inflection point.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing functions with similar equations, such as y = x^3 and y = 1/x^3, students may confuse the shapes of the graphs.
- When identifying the key features of a graph, such as x-intercepts, y-intercepts, and asymptotes, students may incorrectly attribute these features to the wrong type of function.
- When solving problems that involve the comparison of different functions, such as finding the intersection points of a cubic and a reciprocal function, students may mistakenly apply the properties of one function to the other.
- When interpreting real-world data modeled by cubic or reciprocal functions, students may misinterpret the behavior of the data due to their misunderstanding of the underlying graph."
384,"When solving simultaneous equations graphically, they think the solutions are the x-intercepts","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations graphically. They may mistakenly believe that the solutions to the system of equations are the x-intercepts of the individual graphs, rather than the points of intersection between the two graphs. This misconception may stem from previous experiences with finding x-intercepts in linear equations, where the x-intercept represents the solution to the equation.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When given two linear equations, such as y = 2x + 1 and y = x - 2, students may think that the solutions are the x-intercepts of each line (e.g., x = -1/2 for the first equation and x = 2 for the second equation) rather than the point of intersection between the two lines.
- When dealing with quadratic equations, students may mistakenly identify the x-intercepts of the parabola as the solutions to the system, rather than looking for the intersection points between the parabola and the other equation.
- In word problems, students may misinterpret the graphical representation of the problem and think that the x-intercept represents the solution, rather than the point of intersection between the two graphs."
385,"Thinks the reciprocal of n, 1/n = 0.n","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between fractions and decimals. They may believe that taking the reciprocal of a number simply involves putting a decimal point after the number and using it as the repeating digit. For example, they might think that the reciprocal of 2 is 0.2, the reciprocal of 5 is 0.5, and so on. This misconception likely stems from an incomplete understanding of how fractions are converted to decimals, particularly when it comes to repeating decimals. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the reciprocal of whole numbers in fractions, e.g., 1/3 = 0.3
- Solving simple algebraic equations involving fractions, e.g., 2 * x = 1, where students may incorrectly assume x = 0.2
- Comparing the magnitude of fractions, e.g., comparing 1/4 and 1/5 by incorrectly converting them to 0.4 and 0.5, respectively."
386,Believes that an exterior angle can have a value of 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between interior and exterior angles of a polygon. They may mistakenly think that an exterior angle is simply an angle outside a shape, without realizing that it is formed by extending a side of the polygon and is supplementary to the corresponding interior angle. As a result, they may incorrectly conclude that an exterior angle can have a value of 360 degrees, which would actually be the sum of all the exterior angles of a polygon, not a single exterior angle.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the exterior angles of a polygon and mistakenly thinking that one exterior angle can be equal to the sum of all exterior angles (360 degrees).
- When drawing diagrams and mislabeling or incorrectly measuring exterior angles.
- When solving problems involving exterior angles and assuming that a single exterior angle can have a value greater than 180 degrees.
- When comparing interior and exterior angles and failing to recognize that they are supplementary, leading to incorrect conclusions about the possible values of exterior angles."
387,Thinks there are 100 seconds in a minute,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a lack of understanding or recall of basic time units. They may mistakenly apply the concept of 100 units from other areas of measurement, such as percentages or money (100 cents in a dollar), to time units. As a result, they incorrectly assume that there are 100 seconds in a minute instead of the actual 60 seconds.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When converting minutes to seconds in a time problem, such as ""If a song lasts 5 minutes, how many seconds does it last?""
2. When calculating elapsed time, such as ""If it takes 3 minutes to complete a task, and each minute has 100 seconds, how many seconds does it take to complete the task?""
3. When working with time-based word problems, such as ""A car travels at a speed of 50 meters per minute. If there are 100 seconds in a minute, how far does the car travel in 200 seconds?"""
388,When placing a negative number on a number line student assumes numbers with a greater absolute value are placed to the right.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of negative numbers and their placement on the number line. They may think that the larger the absolute value of a number, the further it is to the right on the number line, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. This means that they would place -5 to the right of -3, and possibly even to the right of positive numbers, because they are focusing on the magnitude of the number rather than its direction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the placement of -10 and -5 on a number line, a student with this misconception might place -10 to the right of -5.
- When asked to place -3, -5, and -1 in order on a number line, a student with this misconception might arrange them in the order -5, -3, -1, from left to right.
- When comparing the placement of -2 and 2 on a number line, a student with this misconception might place -2 to the right of 2 because they are focusing on the absolute value rather than the direction of the numbers."
389,Combines variables with constants when writing a formula from a given situation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to distinguish between variables and constants in a given situation, leading them to incorrectly combine these elements when writing a formula. A variable represents a value that can change, whereas a constant represents a fixed value. In algebra, variables are typically represented by letters (e.g., x, y, z), while constants are represented by numbers.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly combine variables and constants by adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them in a way that alters the original relationship between the variable and constant. This can result in a formula that does not accurately represent the situation.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. **Cost calculation:** Tom has a lemonade stand and charges $2 per cup, plus a fixed cost of $5 for the stand rental. If a student writes the formula for the total cost as 2x + 5x (where x is the number of cups sold), they are incorrectly combining the variable (number of cups) with the constant (fixed cost).
2. **Distance calculation:** A car travels at a constant speed of 60 km/h for x hours, and the student writes the formula for the distance traveled as 60 + x, instead of 60x.
3. **Area calculation:** A rectangle has a fixed width of 5 meters and a variable length of x meters. If a student writes the formula for the area as 5 + x, instead of 5x, they are incorrectly combining the constant (width) with the variable (length)."
390,Believes you find the mode by calculating the mean,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the mode, which is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset, can be calculated using the same method as the mean. They may think that adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total count will give them the mode. This misunderstanding may stem from a lack of clear understanding of the definitions and calculations of different statistical measures, such as mean, median, and mode.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the mode of a dataset and they automatically start adding up the numbers and dividing, without considering the frequency of each value.
- When students are given a dataset with multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal) and they try to calculate the mode using the mean formula, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- When students are asked to compare the mean and mode of a dataset and they incorrectly assume that the two values are calculated using the same method.
- When students are given a word problem that asks for the most popular item or value, and they mistakenly try to solve it by calculating the mean."
391,Mixes up the value of two terms when substituting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap or confuse the values of two terms or variables while substituting them into an equation or expression. This can lead to incorrect calculations and ultimately, wrong solutions. The confusion may arise from misreading, mislabeling, or misinterpreting the variables or terms, especially if they are similar in appearance or have similar names.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving simultaneous equations, a student may mistakenly substitute the value of one variable into the wrong equation or swap the values of the variables.
- In algebraic expressions, a student may confuse the values of two variables, such as 'x' and 'y', and substitute the wrong value into the expression.
- When working with formulas, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = length × width), a student may mistakenly swap the values of the length and width, leading to an incorrect calculation.
- In word problems, a student may misinterpret the variables or terms, leading to incorrect substitutions and solutions."
392,"Believes you divide 1 by the number of values, rather than the total, when finding the mean","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the mean, which is a fundamental idea in Data and Statistics. They incorrectly believe that to find the mean, you need to divide 1 by the number of values, rather than dividing the total sum of the values by the number of values. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of what the mean represents, which is the average value of a set of numbers.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the average score of a set of test results, a student may divide 1 by the number of students who took the test, rather than adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of students.
- When calculating the mean height of a group of people, a student may incorrectly divide 1 by the number of people, instead of adding up all the heights and dividing by the total number of people.
- When determining the average amount of money spent by a group of friends at a restaurant, a student may mistakenly divide 1 by the number of friends, rather than adding up the total amount spent and dividing by the number of friends."
393,Believes adding coordinates of endpoint and midpoint of a line will give the other endpoint,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of midpoints in coordinate geometry. They incorrectly assume that adding the coordinates of the endpoint and midpoint of a line will result in the coordinates of the other endpoint. This may be due to a lack of understanding of the midpoint formula, which states that the midpoint of a line is the average of the x-coordinates and the average of the y-coordinates of the endpoints.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the missing endpoint of a line segment given the midpoint and one endpoint, students may simply add the coordinates instead of using the midpoint formula.
- When working with shapes in coordinate geometry, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, students may incorrectly apply this misconception to find the coordinates of other vertices.
- In problem-solving, students may be given the midpoint and one endpoint of a line and asked to find the other endpoint. If they hold this misconception, they will arrive at an incorrect solution."
394,Divides instead of multiplies when multiplying by a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with multiplying a number by a decimal. Instead of understanding that multiplication by a decimal is equivalent to finding a fraction of the number, they mistakenly apply the rules of division, thinking that multiplying by a decimal is the same as dividing by its corresponding whole number. For instance, when asked to calculate 4 x 0.5, they might divide 4 by 5 instead of understanding that 0.5 is half of 1, and therefore, 4 x 0.5 is half of 4.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying a whole number by a decimal: 6 x 0.8 (students might divide 6 by 8 instead of finding 80% of 6)
- Finding the area of a shape with decimal dimensions: If the length of a rectangle is 5.5 cm and the width is 3 cm, students might divide 5.5 by 3 instead of multiplying 5.5 by 3 to find the area.
- Calculating the cost of items with decimal prices: If a toy costs $2.50 and a student wants to buy 4 of them, they might divide $2.50 by 4 instead of multiplying $2.50 by 4 to find the total cost."
395,"Thinks there are 10,000kg in a tonne","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 10,000 kilograms in a tonne. However, this error likely stems from the fact that there are 1,000 kilograms in a metric tonne, but 1 tonne is equal to 1,000 kilograms or 1 megagram. Students might be confusing the conversion between units of mass, specifically between tonnes and kilograms. They may also be confusing this with another unit of mass, or getting the conversion factor incorrect.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- When converting the weight of heavy objects from tonnes to kilograms.
- When solving problems involving the transportation of goods with weights given in tonnes.
- When comparing the weights of objects given in different units (e.g., tonnes and kilograms).
- When working with real-world applications that require conversions between units of mass, such as in construction, transportation, or trade."
396,Does not recognise the height of a trapezium as the perpendicular length between the parallel sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that the height of a trapezium is a specific length measured perpendicular to the two parallel sides, rather than any length that connects the parallel sides. They may incorrectly assume that any line segment drawn between the parallel sides can be considered as the height, regardless of whether it is perpendicular or not. This misunderstanding can lead to errors in calculating the area of a trapezium.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- When asked to find the area of a trapezium, students may draw a diagonal line between the parallel sides and use this length as the height.
- When given a trapezium with additional lines or shapes drawn inside, students may confuse these lines with the actual height.
- When dealing with trapezia that have non-standard orientations, such as rotated or tilted trapezia, students may struggle to identify the correct height.
- When working with real-world problems, such as finding the area of a roof or a building foundation that is in the shape of a trapezium, students may misapply their understanding of height.
- When calculating volumes of 3D shapes, such as trapezoidal prisms, students may carry over their misconception about the height of a trapezium."
397,When calculating the range does not reorder the data to find the largest number minus the smallest number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating the range of a set of data and they fail to reorder the numbers from smallest to largest. Instead, they might subtract the first number in the list from the last number, or they might subtract the smallest number they see from the largest number they see, without verifying that those numbers are indeed the minimum and maximum values in the dataset. This can lead to incorrect calculations of the range.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: The dataset is given in a random order, and the student assumes the first number is the smallest and the last number is the largest.
- Case 2: The dataset contains negative numbers or decimals, which can be tricky to compare, leading the student to incorrectly identify the smallest and largest numbers.
- Case 3: The dataset is very large, making it difficult for the student to manually reorder the numbers, and they might rely on an incorrect assumption about the smallest and largest numbers.
- Case 4: The dataset contains duplicate values, and the student mistakenly uses one of the duplicate values as the smallest or largest number.
- Case 5: The student is working with a dataset that has been partially sorted, but not fully sorted, leading them to incorrectly identify the smallest and largest numbers."
398,Does not know that we can use the conservation of perimeter to find missing lengths,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware that the perimeter of a shape remains constant, even if the shape is rearranged or parts of it are unknown. They may believe that the only way to find missing lengths is through direct measurement or other formulas. As a result, they may struggle to apply the concept of conservation of perimeter to solve problems where a shape's perimeter is known, but some of its side lengths are not.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* A rectangle has a perimeter of 20 cm, with a length of 6 cm and an unknown width. The student may not recognize that they can use the perimeter formula (P = 2l + 2w) to find the missing width.
* A triangle has a perimeter of 15 cm, with two known sides of 5 cm and 4 cm, and an unknown third side. The student may not understand that they can use the fact that the perimeter is conserved to find the length of the missing side.
* A shape is formed by rearranging the sides of a known shape, such as turning a rectangle into a parallelogram. The student may not realize that the perimeter remains the same, even though the shape has changed."
399,Confuses place value when rounding to estimate,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of place value in relation to rounding numbers. They may incorrectly identify the digit to be rounded or the criteria for rounding up or down. For example, when rounding a number to the nearest ten, students may focus on the ones place instead of the tens place, or vice versa. This can lead to inaccurate estimates and a lack of understanding of the impact of rounding on calculations.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 43 to the nearest ten: students may incorrectly round it to 40 instead of 40 or 50 because they focus on the ones place.
- Estimating 432 to the nearest hundred: students may incorrectly round it to 400 instead of 400 or 500 because they misidentify the hundreds place.
- Rounding 9.7 to the nearest whole number: students may incorrectly round it to 9 instead of 10 because they don't understand the criteria for rounding up or down.
- Estimating the sum of 27 and 32 by rounding to the nearest ten: students may incorrectly estimate the sum as 50 instead of 60 because they round the numbers incorrectly."
400,Thinks multiplying a variable by a number is the same as raising that variable to the power of that number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the difference between multiplication and exponentiation operations. They may think that multiplying a variable by a number, for example, 2x, is equivalent to raising that variable to the power of that number, which would be x^2. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of algebraic operations and can lead to errors in solving equations and manipulating expressions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: A student may simplify 3x as x^3 instead of understanding it as '3 times x'.
2. Solving equations: When solving equations like 2x = 8, a student with this misconception may try to find the solution by taking the square root of 8, rather than dividing both sides by 2.
3. Graphing functions: This misconception can also affect the graphing of functions, as students may incorrectly represent the function f(x) = 2x as f(x) = x^2.
4. Word problems: In word problems involving proportional relationships, students may misinterpret the problem and apply exponentiation instead of multiplication. For example, ""If Sara has 3 times as many pencils as Tom, and Tom has x pencils..."" might be incorrectly represented as x^3 instead of 3x."
401,"When given the equation of a straight line, believes the first term always gives the gradient, even when the first term is actually c","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the standard form of a linear equation, y = mx + c, where m represents the gradient (slope) and c represents the y-intercept. Students may mistakenly believe that the first term in any linear equation always represents the gradient, regardless of its actual position or representation in the equation.

For instance, if given an equation in the form y = c + mx, some students may incorrectly identify the constant term 'c' as the gradient, rather than recognizing it as the y-intercept. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of the equation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When the equation is written in the form y = c + mx, students may mistakenly identify 'c' as the gradient.
2. When the equation is rearranged to isolate x, such as x = (y - c) / m, students may incorrectly identify the term (y - c) as the gradient.
3. When dealing with equations in the form y = mx + c, but 'm' is a fraction or a decimal, and 'c' is an integer, students may mistakenly focus on the first term 'c' as the gradient due to its simpler form.
4. When working with equations that involve negative gradients, students may get confused and incorrectly identify the negative sign as part of the y-intercept rather than the gradient."
402,Does not know the definition of a cone,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or have a vague understanding of the geometric shape known as a cone. They may not recognize a cone as a three-dimensional shape with a circular base that tapers to a single point, called the apex or vertex. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in identifying and working with cones in various mathematical contexts.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify and name different shapes, students may confuse a cone with other shapes, such as a cylinder or a pyramid.
- When working with real-life objects, such as ice cream cones or party hats, students may not recognize these objects as examples of cones.
- In geometry lessons, students may struggle to calculate the volume or surface area of a cone due to their misunderstanding of its definition and properties.
- When solving problems involving three-dimensional shapes, students may incorrectly apply formulas or concepts related to other shapes, rather than using those specific to cones."
403,"When rationalising the denominator, confuses the numerator with the denominator","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are required to rationalise the denominator of a fraction containing a surd or radical in the denominator. Rationalising the denominator involves getting rid of the surd in the denominator by multiplying the numerator and denominator by an appropriate value. However, some students mistakenly apply the rationalisation process to the numerator instead of the denominator or get confused about which part of the fraction they need to rationalise. 

This may be due to a lack of understanding of the purpose of rationalising the denominator, which is to make the denominator a rational number, or it could be due to carelessness when applying the procedure. As a result, students may end up with an incorrect fraction or with the surd still present in the denominator.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Rationalising the denominator of a simple fraction, such as 1/√2, where the student may multiply the numerator by √2 instead of the denominator.
- Simplifying more complex fractions, such as (3+√5)/(2-√3), where the student may get confused about which part of the fraction to rationalise.
- Working with expressions involving multiple surds, such as (√3+√2)/(√3-√2), where the student may struggle to keep track of which surds are in the numerator and which are in the denominator."
404,Uses cos when sin is required,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the cosine function (cos) to solve problems that require the use of the sine function (sin). This often happens due to a lack of understanding of the definitions and relationships between the trigonometric functions, particularly in the context of right-angled triangles.

In trigonometry, the sine function relates the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, while the cosine function relates the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly use the cosine function when dealing with problems that involve finding the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. **Right-angled triangle problems**: When finding the length of the opposite side in a right-angled triangle, students may mistakenly use cos instead of sin.
2. **Trigonometric ratios**: When asked to find the sine of an angle in a triangle, students may incorrectly provide the cosine value instead.
3. **Word problems involving trigonometry**: In problems involving real-world applications of trigonometry, such as finding the height of a building or the distance to a ship, students may use cos when sin is required, leading to incorrect solutions.
4. **Graphical analysis**: When analyzing the graphs of sine and cosine functions, students may mistakenly identify the cosine graph as the sine graph, or vice versa.
5. **Identities and equations**: When working with trigonometric identities and equations, students may incorrectly apply the cosine function instead of the sine function, leading to errors in their solutions."
405,Believes the only way to find the interior angle of a regular polygon is to subtract the exterior angle from 180.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of interior and exterior angles of polygons, but may not fully understand the relationship between them. They might believe that the only method to find the interior angle of a regular polygon is by subtracting the exterior angle from 180 degrees. However, this misconception overlooks the fact that there are multiple methods to find the interior angle, including using the formula: Interior Angle = (n-2) * 180 / n, where n is the number of sides of the polygon.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a regular polygon with a known exterior angle and asked to find the interior angle.
- When students are provided with a regular polygon and asked to find the interior angle without being given any additional information about the exterior angle.
- When students are asked to find the interior angle of a regular polygon with a large number of sides, where the exterior angle method might become impractical.
- When students are given a problem involving multiple polygons with different numbers of sides, and they need to find the interior angles for each one."
406,Believes class width multipled by frequency gives the area of the bar in a histogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between class width, frequency, and the area of bars in a histogram. They incorrectly believe that multiplying the class width by the frequency of the data within that class will give the area of the corresponding bar in the histogram. 

This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of how histograms are constructed and the actual relationship between class width, frequency, and area. It may also be due to a lack of understanding of how to correctly calculate the area of bars in a histogram, which represents the density or frequency density of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When students are asked to calculate the area of bars in a histogram and they simply multiply the class width by the frequency without considering the correct formula.
2. When students are given a histogram with varying class widths and frequencies, and they incorrectly calculate the areas of the bars using the multiplication method.
3. When students are asked to compare the areas of different bars in a histogram and they incorrectly conclude that the bar with the highest frequency and widest class width has the largest area."
407,Does not equate y=-x with x=-y,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that the equations y = -x and x = -y represent the same relationship between the variables x and y. They might view these two equations as distinct and unrelated, rather than understanding that they are equivalent and can be transformed into each other by simply swapping the positions of x and y.

This misconception can occur due to a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalence in equations and the fact that the variables can be interchanged without changing the relationship between them.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving linear equations, students might think that the solution to y = -x is different from the solution to x = -y.
- When graphing linear equations, students may graph y = -x and x = -y as two separate and distinct lines, rather than recognizing that they represent the same line.
- When solving systems of equations, students might fail to recognize that the equations y = -x and x = -y represent the same constraint, leading to incorrect solutions."
408,"When multiplying fractions, multiplies both the numerator and denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions. They may think that multiplying fractions involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator separately, resulting in an incorrect product. For instance, when multiplying 1/2 and 3/4, students with this misconception may multiply the numerators (1 and 3) to get 3, and multiply the denominators (2 and 4) to get 8, resulting in the incorrect product 3/8.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying two fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/2 × 3/5
- When multiplying fractions with the same denominator, e.g., 1/4 × 3/4
- When multiplying mixed numbers or improper fractions, e.g., 2 1/3 × 3/4
- When solving real-world problems involving fractions, such as finding the area of a rectangle with fractional dimensions."
409,Identifies first decimal place value when asked for first significant figure,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify the first significant figure of a decimal number, but instead, they identify the first decimal place value. This is because students often get confused between the concept of significant figures and decimal place values. Significant figures refer to the number of digits in a measurement that are known to be reliable and certain, whereas decimal place values refer to the position of a digit in relation to the decimal point.

For example, in the number 0.0456, the first decimal place value is 0, but the first significant figure is 4. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly identify the first significant figure as 0, which is actually the first decimal place value.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to round a decimal number to a certain number of significant figures, but they end up rounding to the wrong place value.
- When students are working with very small or very large numbers, and they get confused between the position of the decimal point and the number of significant figures.
- When students are asked to identify the most reliable digit in a measurement, but they choose the first decimal place value instead of the first significant figure."
410,Believes the size of an angle can be given as a word rather than a number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the size of an angle can be described using descriptive words, such as 'big', 'small', 'wide', or 'narrow', rather than a specific numerical value in degrees. They may not fully understand that angles are measured in degrees and that a precise numerical value is required to accurately describe the size of an angle.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to describe the size of an angle in a geometric shape, a student might say ""the angle is big"" instead of stating the actual degree measure.
- When comparing the sizes of two angles, a student might say ""this angle is wider than that one"" without providing specific measurements.
- When solving a problem that involves calculating the size of an angle, a student might write ""the angle is very small"" instead of providing the actual numerical value.
- When drawing or constructing angles, a student might label an angle as ""large"" or ""small"" instead of using the correct degree measure."
411,"When identifying the center of rotation, chooses a point with the wrong y-value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify the center of rotation of a shape that has been rotated about a certain point. The student incorrectly selects a point with the correct x-coordinate but an incorrect y-coordinate as the center of rotation. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of rotation or a lack of attention to the vertical position of the point of rotation.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When a shape is rotated 90 degrees about a point and the student chooses a point with the same x-coordinate as the actual center of rotation but a different y-coordinate.
- When a shape is rotated 180 degrees about a point and the student selects the midpoint of the shape rather than the actual center of rotation, resulting in an incorrect y-value.
- When a shape is rotated about a point that is not the origin (0, 0), and the student has difficulty adjusting the y-coordinate accordingly.
- When the student is given the coordinates of two points, one of which is the center of rotation, and they mistakenly choose the point with the correct x-coordinate but incorrect y-coordinate as the center of rotation."
412,Assumes that an enlargement is always from the smaller object to the bigger one,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that when performing an enlargement in geometry, the transformation always starts with a smaller object and results in a larger one. Students with this misconception believe that enlargement is a one-way process where the scale factor is always greater than 1, and the resulting object is always larger than the original. They may struggle to understand that enlargement can also involve scaling down an object, where the scale factor is less than 1, and the resulting object is smaller than the original.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to enlarge a shape by a scale factor less than 1, students may think it's not possible or that it's not an enlargement.
- When given a larger object and asked to find the scale factor of enlargement to a smaller object, students may become confused and struggle to find the correct scale factor.
- When working with real-world problems, such as scaling down a model of a building or a map, students may have difficulty applying the concept of enlargement with a scale factor less than 1.
- When comparing the areas or volumes of similar figures, students may incorrectly assume that the larger figure is always the result of an enlargement with a scale factor greater than 1."
413,"Believes that n/n = n, instead of 1","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of division, especially when dividing a number by itself. They may think that the result of dividing a number by itself is the number itself, rather than understanding that any number divided by itself is equal to 1 (except for 0). This misconception can stem from a lack of understanding of the division operation as ""sharing"" or ""groups of"" and not recognizing that a number divided by itself represents a single group or whole.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying fractions, e.g., 5/5 = ?
- Solving equations, e.g., x/x = ?
- Evaluating algebraic expressions, e.g., (2x)/2x = ?
- Interpreting ratios, e.g., a recipe requires a ratio of 2/2 cups of flour to sugar.
- Reducing equivalent fractions, e.g., 6/6 = ?
- Understanding equivalent proportions, e.g., 3/3 = ?"
414,Divides by the order of the root,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when a root is taken, such as a square root or cube root, they need to divide the number by the order of the root. For example, they might think that the square root of 16 is 16 divided by 2, or the cube root of 27 is 27 divided by 3.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of the concept of roots. It may arise from a misunderstanding of the notation used for roots, or from overgeneralizing the concept of division.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* When finding the square root of a number, e.g. √16 = ?
* When finding the cube root of a number, e.g. ∛27 = ?
* When working with higher-order roots, such as fourth roots or fifth roots.
* When solving equations involving roots, such as √x = 4 or ∛x = 3."
415,Incorrectly identifies angles as vertically opposite,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify angles as vertically opposite when they are not. Vertically opposite angles are angles that are opposite each other at a vertex (corner point) formed by two intersecting lines. Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify angles that are adjacent, supplementary, or corresponding as vertically opposite.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with complex diagrams or multiple intersecting lines, students may become confused and incorrectly identify angles as vertically opposite.
- When solving problems involving angles in real-life contexts, such as architecture or design, students may misapply the concept of vertically opposite angles.
- When working with angles in 3D shapes or polyhedra, students may struggle to correctly identify vertically opposite angles due to the added complexity of the third dimension.
- When faced with angles that are close together or have similar measurements, students may mistakenly assume they are vertically opposite.
- When students are given a diagram with multiple angles labeled and are asked to identify the vertically opposite angles, they may incorrectly choose adjacent or supplementary angles instead."
416,Believes the intersection of two complements can be found using the complement of the intersection,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the properties of set operations. They believe that to find the intersection of the complements of two sets, A and B, they can simply find the complement of the intersection of A and B. In other words, they think (A' ∩ B') is equal to (A ∩ B)'. This misunderstanding leads them to incorrectly apply the complement operation and the intersection operation.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When working with Venn diagrams, students might incorrectly shade the regions representing the intersection of the complements of two sets.
- In probability problems, students may incorrectly calculate the probability of the intersection of two complementary events.
- When solving problems involving set theory in algebra, students may apply this misconception, leading to incorrect solutions."
417,"When reading values from graphs, writes down the wrong units","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to correctly identify or interpret the units of measurement on the axes of a graph, leading them to incorrectly record the units of the values they read from the graph. This could be due to a lack of attention to the axis labels, a misunderstanding of the scale used on the graph, or a failure to recognize the importance of units in the context of the data being represented.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student reads a value of 50 from a graph representing the height of objects in meters, but writes down 50 centimeters instead.
- A student records a value of 100 from a graph showing the number of items sold per day, but incorrectly labels it as 100 kilograms instead of 100 units.
- A student reads a value of 20 from a graph representing the temperature in degrees Celsius, but writes down 20 degrees Fahrenheit instead.
- A student interprets a value of 500 from a graph showing distances traveled, but incorrectly assumes it is in miles instead of kilometers."
418,"Believes that when factorising a quadratic, they can choose any two numbers that add to give the coefficient of x","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of factorising quadratic expressions, typically in the form of ax^2 + bx + c. They understand that they need to find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term 'c' and add to give the coefficient of x, which is 'b'. However, they mistakenly believe that any two numbers that add up to 'b' will work, without considering the product of those numbers. They might not fully grasp the relationship between the coefficients and the factors, leading to incorrect factorisation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising the quadratic expression x^2 + 5x + 6, a student might choose 2 and 3 because they add up to 5, without checking if their product equals 6.
- When factorising x^2 + 7x + 10, a student might select 2 and 5 since they add up to 7, without verifying if 2 * 5 equals 10.
- In the expression x^2 + 9x + 20, a student might choose 4 and 5 because their sum is 9, without checking if 4 * 5 equals 20."
419,"When converting a fraction to a decimal, divides the denominator by the numerator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of converting a fraction to a decimal. They mistakenly believe that to convert a fraction to a decimal, they need to divide the denominator (the bottom number) by the numerator (the top number). This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the relationship between fractions and decimals.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting simple fractions, such as 1/2 or 3/4, to decimals.
- When working with word problems that involve converting fractions to decimals, such as calculating the decimal equivalent of a fraction of a quantity.
- When comparing fractions and decimals, such as determining which is greater, 3/4 or 0.75.
- When performing calculations that involve converting fractions to decimals, such as adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators.
- When solving problems that involve converting mixed numbers to decimals, such as 2 3/4."
420,"When finding bearings, finds the back bearing to what the question is actually asking","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a bearing in a specific direction, but instead, they find the bearing in the opposite direction, often referred to as the ""back bearing."" This occurs because students may misunderstand the concept of bearings and the direction they need to measure. Bearings are typically measured clockwise from north, but when finding a back bearing, students are essentially finding the bearing in the opposite direction, which is 180 degrees away from the original bearing.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is asked to find the bearing of a landmark from their current location, but they find the bearing from the landmark to their location instead.
- In a navigation problem, a student is asked to find the bearing to travel from point A to point B, but they find the bearing from point B to point A.
- When working with maps, a student is asked to find the bearing of a route, but they find the bearing of the return route instead of the original route."
421,Mixes up odd and even numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to understand the basic properties of odd and even numbers. They may incorrectly identify numbers as odd or even due to a lack of understanding of the defining characteristics of each. For example, students may think that a number is odd or even based on its magnitude or the digit it ends with, without fully grasping the rule that even numbers always end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, and odd numbers always end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to identify whether a number is odd or even, they might answer incorrectly, e.g., thinking that the number 25 is even because it is a ""big"" number.
- When performing basic arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction, students may incorrectly apply the rules for odd and even numbers, e.g., thinking that the sum of two odd numbers is even, but getting it wrong in practice.
- When solving number patterns or sequences that involve identifying odd or even numbers, students with this misconception may struggle to recognize the correct pattern, leading to incorrect answers.
- When real-world applications involve counting or grouping objects by their odd or even quantities, students with this misconception may make errors, e.g., when dividing a group of 17 students into pairs, thinking that one group can have 9 students (an odd number) and the other group can have 8 students (an even number)."
422,Thinks x = y is an axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the equation x = y as a reference to the x-axis or y-axis on a coordinate plane, rather than understanding it as an equation that describes a specific relationship between the variables x and y. In reality, the equation x = y represents a line where the values of x and y are equal, but students with this misconception may think it refers to the axis itself.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When graphing the equation x = y on a coordinate plane, students may incorrectly label the x-axis or y-axis as the graph of the equation.
- When solving systems of equations, students may mistakenly substitute x = y with the x-axis or y-axis, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When analyzing functions, students may incorrectly identify the equation x = y as the axis of symmetry, rather than recognizing it as a specific type of linear relationship."
423,Does not know the meaning of equilateral,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unfamiliar with or misunderstand the term ""equilateral"" in geometry, particularly in the context of triangles. An equilateral triangle is a specific type of triangle where all three sides are of equal length. Students with this misconception may think that an equilateral triangle is simply any triangle or a triangle with two equal sides (which is actually an isosceles triangle), or they may not recognize the significance of the term equilateral in describing the properties of a shape.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Incorrectly identifying or drawing equilateral triangles, where the sides are not equal in length.
- Failing to recognize that all angles in an equilateral triangle are also equal (60 degrees each).
- Not understanding that equilateral triangles have specific properties, such as equal altitudes, medians, and angle bisectors, due to their symmetrical nature.
- Struggling with calculations or problem-solving involving equilateral triangles, as they may not apply the correct geometric properties.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:
1. When asked to draw an equilateral triangle, a student draws a triangle with sides of different lengths.
2. In a geometry problem, a student calculates the angles of an equilateral triangle as if they were not all equal.
3. When tasked with identifying the properties of an equilateral triangle, a student incorrectly states that only two sides are equal in length."
424,Adds 3 decimal places rather than moving 3 places,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with decimal numbers and are required to convert them to multiples or fractions of a unit, such as converting meters to kilometers or grams to kilograms. They may mistakenly believe that adding 3 decimal places is the correct operation instead of moving the decimal point 3 places to the left or right.

This misconception can be seen in the following cases:

- Converting units: When converting 5000 meters to kilometers, a student might add 3 decimal places (5000.000) instead of moving the decimal point 3 places to the left (5 km).
- Rounding numbers: When rounding a number to the nearest thousand, a student might add 3 decimal places (4567.000) instead of considering the place value of the digits.
- Working with scientific notation: When converting numbers from scientific notation to standard form, a student might add 3 decimal places instead of moving the decimal point according to the exponent."
425,Assumes the third column of a grouped frequency table is always cumulative frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the third column in a grouped frequency table always represents the cumulative frequency. In reality, the third column can represent different types of data, such as the frequency density or the midpoint of each group, depending on the context of the table. 

However, students with this misconception will always assume it's cumulative frequency, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the different types of data that can be represented in a grouped frequency table or a lack of attention to the column labels.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When a student is asked to construct or interpret a grouped frequency table with a third column that represents frequency density, and they incorrectly calculate or interpret it as cumulative frequency.
- When a student is given a grouped frequency table with a third column labeled as ""midpoint"" or ""class mark"", but they still assume it's cumulative frequency and perform incorrect calculations.
- When a student is working with a grouped frequency table that has multiple columns, and they fail to read the column labels carefully, assuming the third column is always cumulative frequency."
426,Believes corresponding angles sum to 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that corresponding angles, which are angles formed by two lines intersecting a transversal, add up to 90 degrees. However, they actually have the same measure, as the transversal creates pairs of congruent angles on either side of the lines. This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of angle properties, possibly due to confusion with complementary angles, which do indeed sum to 90 degrees.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When identifying angles in a diagram with parallel lines cut by a transversal, students might incorrectly calculate the measure of corresponding angles by subtracting their assumed value from 90 degrees.
- When solving problems involving the interior angles of triangles, students may incorrectly assume that corresponding angles within the triangle sum to 90 degrees, rather than understanding the actual angle relationships.
- When determining the measure of angles in a diagram with intersecting lines, students may mistakenly believe that corresponding angles are complementary, leading to incorrect calculations."
427,Answers as if there are 100 minutes in an hour when writing minutes as decimals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert minutes to decimal hours. They may incorrectly assume that there are 100 minutes in an hour, rather than 60. As a result, they may write minutes as decimals with a denominator of 100 instead of 60. For example, 45 minutes would be written as 0.45 hours instead of the correct 0.75 hours. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between minutes and hours and can lead to errors in calculations.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* Converting 30 minutes to decimal hours: A student may write 0.30 hours instead of 0.5 hours.
* Converting 15 minutes to decimal hours: A student may write 0.15 hours instead of 0.25 hours.
* Adding 45 minutes to 2 hours: A student may write 2.45 hours instead of 2.75 hours.
* Subtracting 20 minutes from 3 hours: A student may write 2.80 hours instead of 2.67 hours."
428,"When a point is on an axis, gives both coordinates as the value it's at on the axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are graphing points on the Cartesian coordinate system and they mistakenly believe that when a point lies on one of the axes, both its x and y coordinates take the value of the axis it is on. For example, if a point is on the x-axis at x = 3, students might think that both its x and y coordinates are 3.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Graphing a point on the x-axis: A student might plot the point (3, 0) as (3, 3) because they think both coordinates should be 3 since it's on the x-axis at x = 3.
- Graphing a point on the y-axis: A student might plot the point (0, 4) as (4, 4) because they think both coordinates should be 4 since it's on the y-axis at y = 4.
- Solving equations involving coordinate geometry: A student might solve an equation to find the coordinates of a point on the x-axis, and then write the y-coordinate as the same value as the x-coordinate, instead of 0.
- Identifying coordinates of points on a graph: A student might be given a graph and asked to identify the coordinates of a point on one of the axes, and they might incorrectly state both coordinates as the same value."
429,"When multiplying a surd by an integer, believes the value under the surd can be swapped with the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the properties of surds and multiplication. They may think that when multiplying a surd by an integer, the value under the radical sign (the surd) can be swapped with the integer, resulting in an incorrect simplification. For example, when multiplying √3 by 4, students with this misconception may think that it is equal to √(3*4) = √12, but then incorrectly simplify it to √(4*3) = √4 * √3 = 2√3 and then incorrectly swap the values to get √(3) * 2 = √(4*3) becoming √(3) * √4 = √(3) * 2 to √(4) * √3. However they then get confused and swap the values under the surd with the integer, so they think √3 * 4 is 3√4 instead.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions involving surds and integers, such as √3 * 4 or 2 * √5.
- When solving equations involving surds, such as √x = 2√3.
- When working with geometric problems involving surds, such as finding the perimeter of a triangle with sides involving surds.
- When applying the properties of surds, such as the distributive property, to expressions involving surds and integers."
430,"When finding bearings, finds the bearing going in the reverse direction to the one stated","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the bearing of a point from another point, but they mistakenly calculate the bearing in the opposite direction. For example, if they are asked to find the bearing of point B from point A, they might find the bearing of point A from point B instead. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the definition of a bearing, which is the measure of an angle with respect to the north, or due to a lack of understanding of how to use a compass or a map to find bearings.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the bearing of a ship from a lighthouse, a student might find the bearing of the lighthouse from the ship instead.
- When calculating the bearing of a hiker's destination from their current location, a student might find the bearing of the current location from the destination instead.
- When determining the bearing of a plane from an airport, a student might find the bearing of the airport from the plane instead."
431,Finds interior angle rather than given angle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a specific angle in a geometric shape, but instead of identifying the given angle, they calculate the interior angle of the shape. The interior angle is the angle formed by two adjacent sides of a polygon, whereas the given angle could be an exterior angle, a corresponding angle, or any other type of angle.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When finding corresponding angles in two parallel lines intersected by a transversal, students might find the interior angle of one of the lines instead of the corresponding angle.
* When solving problems involving exterior angles of a polygon, students may calculate the interior angle instead of the exterior angle.
* In trigonometry, students may be asked to find a specific angle in a triangle, but they might calculate the interior angle of the triangle instead of the given angle.
* When working with angles in 3D shapes, students might find the interior angle of one of the faces instead of the given angle."
432,Believes the equation of a straight line is y=-mx-c,"Explanation: This misconception shows that the student has an incorrect understanding of the slope-intercept form of a linear equation. They believe that a negative sign should be applied to both the slope (m) and the y-intercept (c). This indicates a misunderstanding of the relationship between the slope and the y-intercept in the equation of a straight line.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to write the equation of a line with a positive slope and a positive y-intercept.
- When graphing a line and determining its equation based on the slope and y-intercept.
- When solving problems involving linear equations, such as finding the intersection point of two lines or determining the equation of a line given two points.
- When asked to explain the meaning of the slope and y-intercept in the equation of a straight line.
- When comparing the equations of lines with different slopes and y-intercepts."
433,Believes a negative power results in a negative answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of negative exponents. They may think that a negative power automatically means the result will be a negative number, regardless of the base or the actual calculation. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions with negative exponents, such as 2^(-3) or 5^(-2).
- When solving equations involving negative exponents, like 2^(-x) = 4 or 3^(-x) = 1/9.
- When working with scientific notation and dealing with negative exponents, such as converting numbers between standard and scientific notation.
- When graphing functions with negative exponents, like y = 2^(-x) or y = x^(-2).
- When simplifying fractions with negative exponents in the numerator or denominator."
434,"Believes only angles on parallel lines can be called ""corresponding""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of the term ""corresponding angles"" and believe that it only applies to angles formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines. They may think that the concept of corresponding angles is exclusive to this specific geometric configuration and do not realize that corresponding angles can also be identified in other situations, such as when two lines intersect, or when two shapes are similar or congruent.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in identifying and working with corresponding angles in various geometric contexts. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying corresponding angles in intersecting lines, students may struggle to recognize them because they are not parallel lines.
- When working with similar or congruent shapes, students may not recognize the corresponding angles between the shapes.
- When solving problems involving angle relationships in various geometric configurations, students may only look for parallel lines to identify corresponding angles, overlooking other possibilities."
435,Finds a scale factor but forgets to multiply the original value in proportion questions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding the scale factor in proportion questions but incorrectly apply it by not multiplying the original value. They may correctly identify the ratio between two quantities, but then fail to use it to find the missing value by multiplying the original quantity. Instead, they may simply state the scale factor as the answer or add/subtract it from the original value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe for 4 people requires 250g of flour. If the recipe is to be made for 6 people, a student finds the scale factor (6/4 = 1.5) but writes 1.5 as the answer instead of multiplying 250g by 1.5 to find the required amount of flour for 6 people.
- A map has a scale of 1:1000, and a distance on the map is 5cm. A student finds the scale factor (1000) but fails to multiply the 5cm by 1000 to find the actual distance in real life.
- A student is given a proportion question where a car travels 120 miles in 2 hours. If the car travels for 5 hours at the same speed, the student finds the scale factor (5/2 = 2.5) but doesn't multiply the original distance (120 miles) by 2.5 to find the distance traveled in 5 hours."
436,Does not understand when like terms can be collected,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to identify and combine like terms in an algebraic expression. They may not fully grasp that like terms are terms that have the same variable(s) with the same exponent(s), and that only these terms can be combined by adding or subtracting their coefficients. As a result, students may attempt to combine unlike terms or fail to simplify expressions by collecting like terms.

This misconception may manifest in the following cases:

- When adding or subtracting expressions with multiple terms, students may combine terms with different variables or exponents, resulting in incorrect simplifications.
- When simplifying expressions with variables, students may not recognize that terms with the same variable but different coefficients can be combined, leading to missed opportunities for simplification.
- When solving equations, students may fail to collect like terms on one side of the equation, making it more difficult to isolate the variable and solve the equation.
- When working with polynomials, students may struggle to identify and combine like terms, leading to incorrect factorizations or expansions."
437,Does not recognise that probabilities of all possible outcomes will sum to 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that the total probability of all possible outcomes of an event must equal 1. In other words, they do not recognize that the sum of the probabilities of every possible outcome is always 1, which means that one of the outcomes must happen. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly calculate probabilities or to create probability distributions that do not add up to 1.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When calculating the probability of multiple events: A student may calculate the probability of each event separately but fail to check if the sum of these probabilities equals 1.
2. In problems involving probability distributions: Students may create a probability distribution table but not ensure that the probabilities of all outcomes sum to 1.
3. When working with experimental probabilities: Students might collect data and calculate the experimental probability of an event, but they may not verify if the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1.
4. In real-life scenarios: Students might be asked to determine the probability of certain outcomes in real-life situations, such as the probability of it raining or not raining tomorrow, but they may not recognize that the sum of these probabilities must be 1."
438,Believes cubing a number means you multiply it by 3,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of exponentiation, particularly when it comes to cubing a number. They may think that cubing a number, denoted by a small 3 (e.g., 2³), means multiplying the number by 3, rather than understanding that it represents the number being multiplied by itself three times (e.g., 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2). This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the notation and the concept of exponents, leading students to over-simplify the process of cubing a number.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When students are asked to calculate the volume of a cube, and they think that cubing the length of the side means multiplying it by 3.
* When simplifying expressions with exponents, such as 2³, and students incorrectly calculate it as 2 × 3 = 6.
* When solving equations that involve cubing numbers, and students apply the incorrect multiplication rule, leading to incorrect solutions."
439,Believes gradient = change in y multiplied by change in x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient, which is a fundamental idea in Algebra and Geometry. They mistakenly believe that the gradient of a line is calculated by multiplying the change in the y-coordinate by the change in the x-coordinate. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the formula for calculating gradient, which is often presented as a ratio of the change in y to the change in x (i.e., rise over run). Students may incorrectly assume that the multiplication operation is used instead of division.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the gradient of a line given two points, e.g., (2,3) and (4,5), students may calculate the gradient as (5-3) × (4-2) instead of (5-3) ÷ (4-2).
- When determining the gradient of a line from a graph, students may misinterpret the changes in x and y coordinates and multiply them instead of dividing.
- When solving problems involving the gradient of a line, such as finding the equation of a line or determining the steepness of a slope, students may apply the incorrect formula, leading to incorrect answers."
440,Thinks n=0 for the first term in a sequence,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with sequences and they believe that the first term is always denoted by 'n = 0'. They might think that the sequence starts counting from 0, rather than the conventional understanding that 'n' typically starts from 1. This can lead to confusion when identifying terms, calculating values, or applying sequence formulas.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying the first term of an arithmetic or geometric sequence.
- When applying formulas for sequences, such as the nth term formula, and incorrectly substituting 'n = 0' for the first term.
- When counting the position of terms in a sequence and starting from 0 instead of 1.
- When trying to find the value of the first term using the sequence formula and getting confused with the value of 'n'."
441,Does not recognise a unit of volume,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not understand that units of volume, such as millilitres (mL), litres (L), or cubic centimetres (cm³), are used to measure the amount of space occupied by a substance or object. They may not be able to identify or apply these units correctly, leading to incorrect calculations or conversions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the capacity of different containers: Students may not understand that a 500mL bottle holds half the volume of a 1L bottle.
- When measuring ingredients for a recipe: Students may confuse units of volume, such as using 250g of flour instead of 250mL of water.
- When solving problems involving conversions: Students may not know that 1L is equal to 1000mL, leading to incorrect conversions.
- When calculating volumes of 3D shapes: Students may not apply the correct unit of volume, such as using square centimetres (cm²) instead of cubic centimetres (cm³)."
442,Confuses cumulative frequency and frequency density,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between cumulative frequency and frequency density. Cumulative frequency refers to the total number of observations that are less than or equal to a specific value, often plotted on a cumulative frequency graph. Frequency density, on the other hand, is a measure of the number of observations per unit of the variable being measured, often used in histograms.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly interpret the y-axis of a cumulative frequency graph as representing frequency density, or vice versa. They might also mistakenly calculate the frequency density by simply adding up the frequencies, or calculate the cumulative frequency by multiplying the frequency density by the class width.

This misconception can lead to errors in interpreting and analyzing data, particularly when dealing with graphs and charts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When plotting and interpreting cumulative frequency graphs and histograms.
- When calculating and comparing frequencies and frequency densities.
- When analyzing and interpreting data in real-world contexts, such as population growth, exam scores, or climate data.
- When answering questions that require the use of cumulative frequency or frequency density, such as finding the median or modal class of a dataset."
443,Thinks there are 12 hours in 1 day,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students may have a limited understanding of time and how it is divided. They may be familiar with the 12-hour clock and mistakenly believe that a day only consists of 12 hours, rather than 24 hours. This misconception may stem from their daily routines and interactions with time-telling devices, such as analog clocks, which often display time in 12-hour increments.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate elapsed time or duration of events, they may assume that there are only 12 hours in a day.
- When solving problems involving time conversion, such as converting hours to minutes or days, they may use the incorrect assumption of 12 hours in a day.
- When interpreting time-related data, such as schedules or timetables, they may misunderstand the time intervals or durations due to their misconception about the number of hours in a day.
- When working with real-world applications, such as calculating time zones or travel times, their misconception may lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
444,Confuses the value outside of a Venn diagram as the total number of entries in the diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number or value written outside a Venn diagram represents the total number of elements or entries within the diagram. In reality, the number outside the Venn diagram typically represents the universal set or the total number of elements in the sample space, which may not necessarily be the same as the total number of elements within the overlapping circles of the Venn diagram.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to find the total number of elements in a survey that involves overlapping categories (e.g., people who like both football and basketball).
* When students are working with sets and subsets, and they need to identify the number of elements in the union or intersection of two or more sets.
* When students are interpreting data presented in a Venn diagram and need to calculate the total number of observations or entries in the diagram.
* When students are solving problems involving probability and need to determine the total number of outcomes or events in a sample space represented by a Venn diagram."
445,Counts squares instead of the correct scale when plotting coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly count the number of squares on a coordinate grid instead of using the correct scale to determine the coordinates of a point. This means that if the scale is 2 units per square, the student will count each square as one unit instead of two, resulting in incorrect coordinates. 

For example, if a point is 6 units away from the origin on the x-axis and the scale is 2 units per square, a student with this misconception would count 6 squares instead of 3 squares (since each square represents 2 units).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to plot coordinates on a grid with a scale other than 1 unit per square.
- When students are given a graph with a different scale on the x and y axes.
- When students are required to read coordinates from a graph and the scale is not explicitly stated.
- When students are plotting coordinates with decimal or fractional values on a grid with a non-standard scale.
- When students are working with real-world maps or blueprints that use different scales to represent distances."
446,Repeats the digits twice when squaring a number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number involves simply repeating the digits of the original number. For example, they might think that 12 squared (12²) is equal to 1212, rather than actually calculating the result of multiplying 12 by itself (12 × 12 = 144).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Squaring single-digit numbers: A student might think that 5² is 55, instead of 25.
- Squaring multi-digit numbers: A student might think that 14² is 1414, instead of 196.
- Solving algebraic equations: A student might incorrectly simplify an equation like x² = 16 to x = 1616, rather than finding the correct solutions (x = ±4).
- Calculating areas of shapes: A student might think that the area of a square with a side length of 6 is 66, instead of 36 (6²)."
447,Believes dividing by 0.1 is the same as dividing by 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of decimal division. They may think that dividing by a decimal value, such as 0.1, has the same effect as dividing by a whole number, in this case, 10. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between decimals and whole numbers, as well as the concept of place value.

For example, when dividing 10 by 0.1, students with this misconception may think the result is 1, as they would when dividing 10 by 10. This error can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of mathematical concepts.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a number by 0.1, students may move the decimal point one place to the left, as if dividing by 10.
- When solving problems involving money, such as calculating the cost of items sold in tenths of a unit (e.g., 0.1 kg), students may incorrectly divide the cost by 10 instead of 0.1.
- In science problems, such as calculating the number of units in a measurement (e.g., dividing 10 grams by 0.1 grams per unit), students may apply this misconception, leading to incorrect results.
- When converting between units, such as dividing 10 meters by 0.1 meters per second to find the time taken, students with this misconception may arrive at an incorrect answer."
448,Confuses adjacent and opposite sides,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between adjacent and opposite sides in geometric shapes, particularly in triangles and angles. They may incorrectly identify the sides that are next to each other (adjacent) as the sides that are across from each other (opposite), and vice versa. This can lead to errors in calculating trigonometric ratios, such as sine, cosine, and tangent, and in solving problems involving angles and shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When identifying the sides of a right triangle in a trigonometry problem.
* When determining the relationships between angles and sides in a geometric shape.
* When solving problems involving the Pythagorean theorem.
* When working with angles in degrees or radians.
* When graphing functions involving trigonometric ratios.
* When solving problems involving similar triangles.
* When calculating the perimeter or area of a triangle or other polygon."
449,"Does not realise we can scale the perimeter as a whole, rather than finding individual side lengths","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the perimeter of a shape that has been enlarged or scaled by a certain factor. Instead of realizing that the perimeter can be scaled as a whole, they may believe that they need to find the individual side lengths of the new shape. This can lead to unnecessary calculations and a failure to recognize the proportional relationship between the original shape and the scaled shape.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the perimeter of a scaled-up rectangle, students may try to calculate the new lengths and widths individually instead of multiplying the original perimeter by the scale factor.
- When solving problems involving the perimeter of similar shapes, students may attempt to find the side lengths of each shape separately rather than using the scale factor to find the perimeter of the larger shape.
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as finding the perimeter of a scaled-up architectural design or a magnified image, students may not recognize that the perimeter can be scaled as a whole, leading to incorrect calculations."
450,Confuses the terms faces and vertices,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the terms ""faces"" and ""vertices"" in geometry, particularly when dealing with 3D shapes. Students may mistakenly refer to the vertices (corners) of a shape as faces, or vice versa, due to a lack of understanding of the definitions and properties of these terms.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the number of faces and vertices of a cube, a student may incorrectly state that a cube has 8 faces (when it actually has 6 faces and 8 vertices).
- When drawing or describing a 3D shape, a student may confuse the vertices with the faces, resulting in an inaccurate representation of the shape.
- When solving problems involving surface area or volume of 3D shapes, a student's confusion between faces and vertices can lead to incorrect calculations.
- When classifying 3D shapes, such as identifying a shape as a polyhedron or a prism, a student's misunderstanding of faces and vertices can lead to incorrect classifications."
451,Does not recognise parallel lines angle rules applied inside a shape,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that the angle rules for parallel lines, such as corresponding angles, alternate angles, and interior angles, also apply when those parallel lines are part of a larger shape, like a triangle, quadrilateral, or polygon. Students might think that these rules only apply to isolated pairs of parallel lines, not realizing that they are still valid when the lines are embedded within a shape.

This misconception may manifest in the following cases:

- When finding missing angles in a quadrilateral or polygon with parallel sides, students may not use the properties of parallel lines to determine the measures of the angles.
- When solving problems involving shapes with parallel sides, students might not recognize the relationships between angles formed by the parallel lines, leading to incorrect calculations.
- In geometric constructions or proofs, students may not apply the angle rules for parallel lines correctly, resulting in incorrect conclusions or incomplete proofs.
- When dealing with more complex shapes, such as trapezoids or parallelograms, students might not recognize how the parallel lines angle rules can be used to find missing angles or lengths of sides."
452,"When a variable in an expression has a power, thinks the power applies to the whole expression","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that an exponent (or power) applies to the entire expression, rather than just the variable it is attached to. For example, in the expression 3x^2, students with this misconception may think that the exponent 2 applies to both the 3 and the x, rather than just the x.

This misconception can lead to incorrect simplification and manipulation of algebraic expressions. Students may incorrectly apply the exponent to all parts of the expression, resulting in incorrect solutions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Simplifying expressions: 2x^3, where students may think the exponent 3 applies to both the 2 and the x.
- Expanding expressions: (2x)^2, where students may incorrectly apply the exponent 2 to just the x, rather than the entire expression inside the parentheses.
- Solving equations: x^2 + 3 = 10, where students may think the exponent 2 applies to the constant term 3 as well.
- Differentiating expressions in calculus: 2x^3, where students may incorrectly apply the power rule of differentiation to the entire expression, rather than just the x^3 term."
453,Believes qualitative data can be continuous,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between qualitative (or categorical) data and quantitative data. They may believe that qualitative data, which typically represents non-numerical information, can be measured on a continuous scale. In reality, qualitative data is usually categorical, meaning it can only take on distinct, non-numerical values.

For instance, students may think that they can measure someone's favorite color on a continuous scale, from ""red"" to ""blue"", which doesn't make sense as colors are categorical. Similarly, they might try to plot a graph of favorite foods on a continuous axis, which is also incorrect.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student tries to create a line graph to show the most popular sports teams in the school, treating the team names as if they were numerical values.
2. A student attempts to calculate the mean of a set of categorical data, such as favorite colors or music genres.
3. A student tries to create a histogram to display the distribution of students' favorite subjects in school, treating the subjects as if they were continuous variables."
454,Thinks measures of area must end in squared,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any measurement of area must be expressed with a squared unit, regardless of the context or the specific measurement being taken. They might think that simply appending a squared unit to the end of a measurement makes it a valid area. For example, if a student measures the length of a room as 10 meters and is asked to find the area, they might respond with ""10 meters squared,"" even if they haven't actually performed the necessary calculation to determine the area.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When calculating the area of a room, a student might say the area is ""10 meters squared"" instead of understanding that the correct calculation involves multiplying the length and width.
- When comparing the areas of different shapes, a student might argue that a shape with a measurement of ""5 meters squared"" is smaller than one with ""10 meters squared,"" without considering the actual dimensions and calculations involved.
- When solving word problems involving area, a student might incorrectly assume that any measurement ending in ""squared"" is automatically an area, without checking the context or units."
455,Subtracts 1 rather than 2 from the number of sides when finding the sum of interior angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the sum of interior angles in a polygon. They understand that the formula for the sum of interior angles involves subtracting a certain number from the product of the number of sides and 180 degrees. However, they mistakenly believe that subtracting 1 from the number of sides will give them the correct formula. As a result, they use the incorrect formula (n-1) * 180 instead of the correct one.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the sum of interior angles in a hexagon (6-sided polygon), a student may write (6-1) * 180 = 5 * 180 = 900 degrees instead of the correct (6-2) * 180 = 4 * 180 = 720 degrees.
- When calculating the sum of interior angles in a triangle (3-sided polygon), a student may use the incorrect formula (3-1) * 180 = 2 * 180 = 360 degrees instead of the correct (3-2) * 180 = 1 * 180 = 180 degrees.
- When solving a problem involving the sum of interior angles in an octagon (8-sided polygon), a student may mistakenly apply the formula as (8-1) * 180 = 7 * 180 = 1260 degrees instead of the correct (8-2) * 180 = 6 * 180 = 1080 degrees."
456,Believes you can divide the change by 100 to find the percentage change ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating percentage changes, such as percentage increases or decreases, and mistakenly believe that to find the percentage change, they can simply divide the change by 100. This misunderstanding stems from the fact that percentages are often represented as a proportion out of 100, leading students to think that dividing the change by 100 will automatically give them the percentage change.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the percentage increase in the price of an item: For example, if a shirt originally costs $20 and the price increases by $8, students may think that dividing the $8 increase by 100 will give them the percentage increase.
- Calculating the percentage decrease in a quantity: If a store has 50 items and they sell 10, students may believe that dividing the 10 items by 100 will give them the percentage decrease.
- Determining the percentage change in a measurement: If a person's weight increases from 60 kg to 72 kg, students may think that dividing the 12 kg increase by 100 will give them the percentage change in weight.

In each of these cases, students will arrive at an incorrect answer, highlighting the need to address this misconception and develop a deeper understanding of percentage changes."
457,Does not know how to calculate volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand the concept of volume and how it is calculated, often confusing it with other measurements such as area or perimeter. They may struggle to identify the correct formula for calculating the volume of different shapes, such as cubes, cuboids, cylinders, or spheres. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of real-world applications where volume is an essential measurement.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the volume of a cube, but they use the formula for the area of a square instead (e.g., using length x width instead of length x width x height).
- When students are given a problem involving the volume of a cylinder, but they incorrectly use the formula for the area of a circle (e.g., using πr^2 instead of πr^2h).
- When students are asked to compare the volumes of different shapes, but they incorrectly assume that the shape with the larger surface area will always have the larger volume.
- When students are given a real-world problem, such as calculating the volume of water in a tank or the volume of a rectangular prism, but they are unable to apply the correct formula or concept to solve the problem."
458,When finding an input of a function machine thinks you apply the operations given rather than the inverse operation.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with function machines, which are often used to represent simple functions. Students may mistakenly believe that to find the input of a function machine, they need to apply the operations given in the function, rather than using the inverse operation. 

For example, if a function machine has the rule ""multiply by 3"" and the output is 12, students with this misconception may think that to find the input, they need to multiply 12 by 3 again, rather than dividing 12 by 3.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When finding the input of a simple function machine with a single operation, like ""add 2"" or ""multiply by 4"".
- When working with more complex function machines that involve multiple operations, such as ""multiply by 2, then add 3"".
- When dealing with real-world problems that involve inverse operations, like finding the original price of an item that has been discounted by a certain percentage."
459,confuses circumference and area,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr or C = πd) to calculate the area, or vice versa, using the formula for the area of a circle (A = πr^2) to calculate the circumference. They may also incorrectly apply the units, such as measuring the circumference in square units instead of linear units, or the area in linear units instead of square units.

This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the distinct concepts of circumference (the distance around a circle) and area (the amount of space inside a circle), or from a failure to recognize the different formulas and units associated with each.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is asked to find the area of a circle with a radius of 4 cm and responds with 2π(4) = 8π cm.
* A student measures the circumference of a circle to be 20π cm and then calculates the area as 20π cm^2.
* A student is given the area of a circle as 16π cm^2 and attempts to find the circumference by taking the square root of the area.
* A student is asked to solve a problem involving the perimeter (circumference) of a circle, but provides an answer in square units (e.g., cm^2) instead of linear units (e.g., cm)."
460,"Believes the graph of x squared + c has the turning point of (-c, 0)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning about quadratic functions, specifically in the form of y = x^2 + c. The students mistakenly believe that the turning point (or vertex) of the parabola is at the point (-c, 0). This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of how the constant term 'c' affects the graph of the quadratic function. The students may be incorrectly applying the concept of how 'c' affects the x-intercept to the turning point.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing a quadratic function in the form of y = x^2 + c and asked to identify the turning point.
- When solving problems that involve finding the vertex of a parabola in the form of y = x^2 + c.
- When comparing the graphs of different quadratic functions in the form of y = x^2 + c and asked to describe how the value of 'c' affects the turning point."
461,"When finding the median for an odd numbered data set, find the midpoint of two values rather than giving the middle value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unsure or misunderstand the process of finding the median in data sets with an odd number of values. They mistakenly apply the method used for even-numbered data sets, where the median is indeed found by taking the midpoint of the two middle values. As a result, they incorrectly attempt to average the two values surrounding the actual middle value in an odd-numbered data set, rather than simply selecting the middle value itself.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the median of the exam scores 55, 65, 70, 75, 80, where the student averages 70 and 75 instead of selecting 70 as the median.
- Determining the median of the set of numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, where the student calculates the midpoint of 6 and 8 instead of choosing 6 as the median.
- Calculating the median of the data set 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, where the student averages 20 and 25 instead of selecting 20 as the median."
462,Thinks that they can combine functions in a function machine before applying them to the input,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can change the order of operations or combine multiple functions in a single step, rather than applying them sequentially. In function machines, each function is applied to the input in a specific order, with the output of one function becoming the input for the next. However, students with this misconception may try to simplify the process by combining or rearranging the functions before applying them to the input.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When students are given a composite function, like f(g(x)), and try to simplify it by combining the functions f and g before applying them to the input x.
* When students are working with multiple operations, such as addition, multiplication, and division, and try to perform these operations in a different order or combine them in a single step.
* When students are using function machines to model real-world problems and try to simplify the process by combining or rearranging the functions, rather than applying them sequentially.

For example, consider a function machine that first multiplies the input by 2 and then adds 3. A student with this misconception might try to combine the functions by multiplying the input by 2 and adding 3 simultaneously, rather than applying the operations sequentially."
463,Reads the complement of what is required from a pie chart,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the information presented in a pie chart. Instead of reading the correct proportion or percentage that corresponds to a particular category, they mistakenly read the proportion or percentage that is left over or is the complement of the required information. For example, if a pie chart shows that 60% of the students like football, and the question asks what percentage of students like football, a student with this misconception may incorrectly read the pie chart and say that 40% of the students like football, which is the complement of the correct answer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When the question asks for the proportion or percentage of a particular category, and the student mistakenly reads the proportion or percentage of the remaining categories.
- When the student is asked to find the proportion or percentage of a category that is not explicitly stated in the pie chart, and they incorrectly assume that it is the complement of the given information.
- When the pie chart displays multiple categories, and the student becomes confused about which category they are supposed to read, resulting in them reading the complement of the required information.
- When the question requires the student to compare the proportions or percentages of two or more categories, and they mistakenly compare the complement of one category to the actual proportion or percentage of another category."
464,Believes that you are unable to calculate the sum of the interior angles of an irregular polygon given the number of sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the formula for calculating the sum of interior angles of a polygon only applies to regular polygons. They may think that because an irregular polygon has sides of different lengths and angles of different measures, there is no straightforward way to calculate the total sum of its interior angles. They might incorrectly assume that the formula is only applicable when the polygon is symmetrical or has equal sides, and therefore struggle to find the sum of interior angles in irregular polygons.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When given an irregular hexagon and asked to find the sum of its interior angles, a student with this misconception might say it's impossible to calculate without knowing the measures of each angle.
- When presented with an irregular triangle, a student might incorrectly believe that the sum of its interior angles cannot be found because the sides are of different lengths.
- When asked to find the sum of interior angles of an irregular octagon, a student with this misconception might try to find the measures of each individual angle rather than applying a general formula."
465,Does not know the diagonals of a square bisect at right angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand or recall the properties of a square. A square is a type of quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles. One of its key properties is that its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. However, some students might mistakenly think that the diagonals either do not bisect each other or do not intersect at right angles. This misunderstanding could stem from a lack of exposure to geometric shapes, inadequate practice, or failure to recognize the symmetrical nature of a square.

This misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When asked to draw or describe the properties of a square, students may draw the diagonals but not show them intersecting at right angles.
- When given a problem that involves finding the length of a diagonal or the angle at which the diagonals intersect, students may provide incorrect answers.
- When tasked with identifying shapes that have diagonals that bisect each other at right angles, students may not select a square as one of the correct options.
- When asked to explain why a square is a special type of rhombus or rectangle, students may not mention the property of its diagonals bisecting each other at right angles."
466,"When calculating with numbers in standard form, just applies the operation to the number and the power separately","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with numbers in standard form (also known as scientific notation) and are asked to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. They may incorrectly assume that they can simply apply the operation to the number (coefficient) and the power (exponent) separately, without considering the properties of exponents.

For example, when multiplying two numbers in standard form, students may think they can multiply the coefficients and add the exponents, but they may not consider the fact that the exponents need to be added only when the bases are the same. Similarly, when dividing numbers in standard form, students may think they can divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents without considering the properties of exponents.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Multiplying (3 x 10^2) and (2 x 10^3) and getting (6 x 10^5) instead of (6 x 10^5).
- Dividing (6 x 10^3) by (2 x 10^2) and getting (3 x 10^1) instead of (3 x 10^1).
- Adding (2 x 10^2) and (3 x 10^2) and getting (5 x 10^4) instead of (5 x 10^2).
- Subtracting (2 x 10^2) from (3 x 10^2) and getting (1 x 10^4) instead of (1 x 10^2)."
467,Treats zero as a ten when subtracting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly consider the digit 0 as a placeholder for 10 when performing subtraction operations. They may think that subtracting a number from a multiple of 10 will result in the same digits, but with a 10 in the tens place being 'replaced' by a 0. This misunderstanding is thought to be due to difficulties in understanding place value, or an over-reliance on rote learning of procedures rather than a true grasp of the underlying math concepts.

Example cases where the misconception may occur:

- 50 - 20 = ? (student answer: 40 - 10 = 30, or 50 - 20 = 40 - 10 = 30, treating the 0 in 50 as a 10)
- 100 - 30 = ? (student answer: 100 - 30 = 90 - 10 - 20 = 70, treating the 0 in 100 as a 10)
- 500 - 40 = ? (student answer: 500 - 40 = 490 - 10 = 480, treating the 0 in 500 as a 10)"
468,Believes you find the frequency for a pie chart sector by calculating its angle divided by the total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly reverse the process of finding the angle of a sector in a pie chart. They may believe that to find the frequency of a particular category, they need to divide the angle of the corresponding sector by the total frequency, instead of understanding that the angle is actually proportional to the frequency. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of how pie charts represent data and the relationship between the angle of a sector and its corresponding frequency.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to find the frequency of a particular category in a pie chart and they are given the angle of the sector.
- When students are given a pie chart with missing frequencies and are asked to calculate them using the angles of the sectors.
- When students are creating their own pie charts and need to determine the frequencies of each category based on the angles of the sectors."
469,Believes the position of a sequence cannot be an integer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of sequences, particularly those with fractional or decimal terms. They may assume that the position of a term (n) in a sequence must be a whole number, as they are used to counting discrete objects. As a result, they may struggle to understand that a sequence can have a term at a non-integer position, such as the 2.5th or 3/4th term.

This misconception can manifest in various situations, including:

* When working with sequences that involve time intervals, such as measuring the height of an object every 0.5 seconds.
* In problems involving interest rates or investment growth, where the position in the sequence may represent a fraction of a year.
* When dealing with geometric sequences that involve non-integer exponents, leading to non-integer positions in the sequence.
* In real-world applications, such as modeling population growth or chemical reactions, where the position in the sequence may not always be an integer.
* When graphing sequences on a coordinate plane, where students may struggle to understand that the x-axis can represent non-integer positions in the sequence."
470,Cannot reflect shape when line of symmetry is diagonal ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to reflect a shape across a line of symmetry that is not horizontal or vertical, but rather diagonal. They may struggle to visualize or execute the reflection, believing that reflections can only occur across lines that are parallel to the x or y axes. This misconception may stem from a lack of exposure to reflections across non-horizontal or non-vertical lines, or from a misunderstanding of the concept of line symmetry.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When asked to reflect a triangle across its diagonal line of symmetry.
* When reflecting a quadrilateral with a diagonal line of symmetry, such as a kite or a rhombus.
* When working with irregular polygons that have diagonal lines of symmetry.
* When reflecting shapes across lines that are not parallel to the edges of the paper or the coordinate axes.
* When dealing with real-world applications, such as reflecting a shape across a diagonal line in art or design."
471,Believes that the solution to ax + b = 0 is x = -a/b,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students incorrectly apply the formula for solving linear equations. They mistakenly believe that to solve the equation ax + b = 0, they need to divide both sides by b and then multiply both sides by -1, or simply rearrange the equation incorrectly. They may also mistakenly apply the formula x = -b/a, which is correct, but reverse the positions of a and b, resulting in x = -a/b. This misconception can lead to incorrect solutions and a lack of understanding of linear equations.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

* When solving linear equations with variables on one side, such as 2x + 3 = 0, the student may incorrectly write x = -2/3 instead of x = -3/2.
* When solving linear equations with variables on both sides, such as x + 2 = -3x, the student may incorrectly rearrange the equation and write x = -1/4 instead of x = -2/4 or x = -1/2 after correctly rearranging the equation.
* When solving word problems that involve linear equations, such as ""Tom has 5 more than 3 times as many books as his friend. If Tom has 20 books, how many books does his friend have?"", the student may incorrectly set up the equation and solve for the variable using the incorrect formula x = -a/b."
472,Multiplies the value as if the original recipe was for 1 person,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to scale up or down a recipe or a set of quantities to serve a different number of people. Instead of multiplying each ingredient by the scaling factor, they incorrectly assume the original recipe is for one person and multiply the ingredients by the total number of people they want to serve. This results in an incorrect calculation and often leads to an excessive amount of ingredients.

For example, if a recipe serves 4 people and requires 200g of flour, and the students want to make the recipe for 6 people, they might multiply 200g by 6 (thinking the original recipe was for 1 person) instead of multiplying it by 1.5 (the correct scaling factor). This would result in 1200g of flour, which is significantly more than needed.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe for making 8 sandwiches requires 400g of ham. If the students want to make the recipe for 12 people, they might multiply 400g by 12.
- A set of instructions for making a certain amount of paint requires 3 cups of water to make 2 liters of paint. If the students want to make 5 liters of paint, they might multiply 3 cups by 5.
- A recipe for baking a cake serves 8 people and requires 250g of sugar. If the students want to make the recipe for 10 people, they might multiply 250g by 10."
473,Underestimates the impact of the size of images in a misleading statistical diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize how the size or scale of images in a statistical diagram can be manipulated to distort the representation of data, leading to misleading conclusions. They may overlook how changes in the size of images, such as increasing the height or width of bars or using different scales for different categories, can exaggerate or downplay the differences between data points. This misconception can result in students misinterpreting the data and drawing incorrect conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is analyzing a bar chart comparing the number of books sold by two authors, where the bars are of different widths, making one author's sales appear significantly higher than the other, even if the actual difference is small.
- Case 2: A student is looking at a graph showing the growth of two companies over time, where the scale on the y-axis is not consistent, making one company's growth appear more rapid than it actually is.
- Case 3: A student is examining a pie chart displaying the market share of different companies, where the size of the pie slices is not proportional to the actual market share, leading to an incorrect understanding of the relative market share of each company."
474,Thinks 1l = 100 cubic centimetres,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that 1 liter (1l) is equivalent to 100 cubic centimeters (cm³) instead of the correct conversion, which is 1 liter equals 1000 cubic centimeters (or 1000 milliliters). This error may stem from a misunderstanding of the relationship between units of measurement, particularly when converting between liters and cubic centimeters.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to convert a volume from liters to cubic centimeters, such as calculating the volume of a container in cubic centimeters when given its volume in liters.
- During experiments or activities that involve measuring liquids, where students may misinterpret the markings on a measuring cylinder or container.
- When solving problems that require calculations involving different units of measurement, such as determining the volume of a rectangular prism in cubic centimeters when given its dimensions in centimeters and a volume in liters."
475,Believes the total of a part whole model is always 1 (or equivalent) instead of the given total,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with part-whole models, often represented as diagrams or fractions. They mistakenly assume that the total of the parts must always equal 1, or 100% of the whole, regardless of the actual total given in the problem. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly scale or proportion the parts of the whole, resulting in inaccurate calculations and conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A fraction problem states that 3/8 of a pizza has been eaten, and the remaining pizza is to be shared among friends. The student assumes the total parts must add up to 1 whole pizza, rather than using the given total (8 parts).
- A percentage problem states that a shirt is on sale for 25% off its original price of $80. The student incorrectly calculates the discount as 25% of $1 (or 1 whole), rather than 25% of the actual price, $80.
- A ratio problem states that the ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:5, and there are 24 students in total. The student mistakenly assumes the total parts must add up to 1 whole (or 8 parts), rather than using the given total (24 students, or 8 parts x 3)."
476,Thinks Angle-Angle-Angle triangles are congruent,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that two triangles are congruent if their corresponding angles are equal (Angle-Angle-Angle, or AAA). They may think that since the angles are the same, the triangles must be identical in size and shape. However, this is not the case. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two triangles with the same angle measurements, but different side lengths. For example, two triangles with angles 60-60-60 degrees, but one with side lengths 3-3-3 units and the other with side lengths 5-5-5 units.
- When solving problems involving similar triangles, where students may incorrectly assume that the triangles are congruent due to equal angles, rather than just similar.
- When working with diagrams or models, where students may not notice or consider the differences in side lengths, leading them to conclude that the triangles are congruent based solely on the angle measurements.
- When dealing with word problems that involve describing or comparing triangles, where students may incorrectly apply the AAA concept to conclude that two triangles are congruent."
477,"Believes when multiplying fractions you cross multiply top left and bottom right for numerator, and the other diagonal for denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply a procedure that resembles the method for comparing fractions or finding equivalent fractions (cross multiplying) to the operation of multiplying fractions. When multiplying fractions, students with this misconception believe that the numerator of the product is obtained by multiplying the numerator of the first fraction with the denominator of the second fraction, and the denominator of the product is obtained by multiplying the denominator of the first fraction with the numerator of the second fraction. This misconception can lead to incorrect results and a misunderstanding of the concept of multiplying fractions.

Cases where the misconception will occur:

* Multiplying two fractions with different denominators: e.g., 1/2 × 3/4
* Multiplying fractions with variables: e.g., 1/x × x/2
* Multiplying mixed numbers: e.g., 2 1/2 × 3 3/4
* Word problems involving multiplying fractions: e.g., ""A recipe calls for 1/4 cup of sugar, and you want to make 3/4 of the recipe."""
478,Does not know what a square number is,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unclear about the definition of a square number. A student with this misconception may believe that a square number is any number that can be written with a square symbol, or they may think it is a number that is somehow ""square"" in shape. They might also confuse square numbers with other mathematical concepts, such as even numbers or prime numbers. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When a student is first introduced to the concept of square numbers and struggles to grasp the idea that a square number is actually the result of multiplying an integer by itself (e.g., 4 is a square number because 2 x 2 = 4).
- When a student sees a number that is a perfect square in a mathematical problem, but does not recognize it as a square number, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- When a student is asked to identify or generate a list of square numbers and includes incorrect numbers or excludes correct ones due to their misunderstanding of the concept."
479,Thinks a divide and a negative sign next to each other makes a plus,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a division operation (denoted by a division symbol, often a forward slash or a horizontal line) followed by a negative sign can be simplified to a single addition operation. They may think that the division and negative signs somehow 'cancel out' to form a plus sign. This misunderstanding can be due to an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the order of operations and the properties of negative numbers.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* -12 ÷ -3, where the student might incorrectly simplify it as 12 + 3
* 18 ÷ -2, where the student might incorrectly simplify it as 18 + 2
* -15 ÷ -5, where the student might incorrectly simplify it as 15 + 5

This misconception can also be observed when students work with algebraic expressions, such as:

* -x ÷ -2, where the student might incorrectly simplify it as x + 2
* 3x ÷ -4, where the student might incorrectly simplify it as 3x + 4

It's essential to address this misconception to ensure students understand the correct application of mathematical operations and develop a solid foundation for more advanced math concepts."
480,Believes that angles that look like they are a right-angle are always 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students rely too heavily on visual inspection to determine the measure of an angle, particularly when it comes to right angles. They may believe that if an angle ""looks like"" a right angle (i.e., it appears to be a perfect corner), then it must be exactly 90 degrees. This misconception can be attributed to the fact that students often encounter many examples of right angles in everyday life, such as the corners of a book or a room, which can create an assumption that all angles that resemble these are also 90 degrees.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or identifying right angles in a diagram, a student may assume that an angle that looks like a right angle is 90 degrees without actually measuring it.
- When working with shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, a student may assume that an angle that appears to be a right angle is 90 degrees, even if it's not explicitly stated.
- When solving problems involving angles in real-world contexts, such as building design or construction, a student may assume that an angle that looks like a right angle is 90 degrees, which can lead to inaccurate calculations or conclusions."
481,Thinks the inverse of subtraction is multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the opposite operation of subtraction is multiplication. They may think that to ""undo"" a subtraction, they need to multiply, rather than add. This misconception can be due to a lack of understanding of the relationships between addition and subtraction, or a misunderstanding of the concept of inverse operations.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When solving equations, a student may try to isolate a variable by multiplying both sides by a value, instead of adding or subtracting.
* When working with word problems that involve taking away or finding a difference, a student may incorrectly use multiplication to solve the problem.
* When asked to find the missing number in a subtraction problem, a student may try to multiply the given numbers instead of adding them to find the solution.
* When using number lines or counting blocks to visualize subtraction, a student may mistakenly use multiplication to move in the opposite direction.
* When solving problems that involve negative numbers, a student may incorrectly use multiplication to ""cancel out"" the negative sign."
482,"When simplifying surds, does not understand that the simplified root is what is left after dividing out the largest square number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. They fail to recognize that the goal of simplifying surds is to factor out the largest perfect square from the radicand (the number inside the square root). 

Instead of identifying and dividing out the largest square number, they might leave the surd in its original form, attempt to simplify it incorrectly, or only factor out smaller perfect squares. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of surd simplification and the rules that govern it.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying √48: Students may not recognize that 48 can be broken down into 16 (a perfect square) and 3, resulting in 4√3.
- Simplifying √75: Students may not identify that 75 can be broken down into 25 (a perfect square) and 3, resulting in 5√3.
- Simplifying √180: Students may struggle to recognize that 180 can be broken down into 36 (a perfect square) and 5, resulting in 6√5."
483,"Thinks that the square root of an expression square roots each term in the expression, rather than square rooting the whole expression","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that taking the square root of an expression is a distributive operation, similar to how multiplication or addition works. They think that by square rooting an expression, each individual term within the expression is square rooted separately, rather than treating the expression as a whole. For instance, given the expression √(x^2 + 4), a student with this misconception might think that it is equal to √x^2 + √4, which would then simplify to x + 2.

This misconception can occur in various cases such as:

- Simplifying expressions like √(x^2 + y^2), where students may think it becomes √x^2 + √y^2, which is x + y.
- Evaluating expressions like √(16 + 9), where students might calculate it as √16 + √9, resulting in 4 + 3 = 7.
- Solving equations like √(x^2 + 4) = 3, where students may attempt to solve it by square rooting each term separately, leading to incorrect solutions."
484,Mistakes cube root for cubing the number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the cube root operation with the cubing operation. They mistakenly believe that finding the cube root of a number means raising that number to the power of 3, rather than finding the number that, when cubed, gives the original value. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the notation and terminology used for cube roots, or a misunderstanding of the relationship between cube roots and cubing.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions involving cube roots, students may incorrectly cube the number inside the cube root, e.g. ∛8 = 8³ = 512, instead of finding the correct cube root, which is ∛8 = 2.
- When solving equations involving cube roots, students may incorrectly cube the constant term, e.g. ∛x = 4, so x = 4³ = 64, instead of finding the correct value of x, which is x = 64.
- When working with real-world problems involving volumes of cubes, students may incorrectly cube the length of a side, e.g. if the volume of a cube is 27 cubic units, students may think the side length is 27³, instead of finding the correct side length, which is ∛27 = 3."
485,Believes 1 is not a factor of a number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of factors, often thinking that a factor must be a number that divides another number into equal groups of more than one. They may overlook the fact that 1 can divide any number without leaving a remainder, which is the defining characteristic of a factor. As a result, students may consistently exclude 1 as a factor when listing factors of a given number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When listing all the factors of a number, such as the factors of 12, students might write 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, but forget to include 1.
2. When determining the common factors of two numbers, like 8 and 12, students may identify 2 and 4 as common factors but neglect to include 1.
3. In word problems, such as sharing a set of objects into equal groups, students might not consider 1 as a possible group size, even though it satisfies the condition of equal grouping."
486,Does not square the conversion factor when converting squared units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are required to convert between different units of area or volume, but they fail to recognize that the conversion factor must be squared (or cubed for volume) when dealing with squared (or cubed) units. For example, if 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, students might incorrectly convert 1 square meter to square centimeters by simply multiplying 1 by 100, instead of squaring the conversion factor (100^2).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 1 square meter to square centimeters
- Changing 1 square kilometer to square meters
- Converting the area of a room from square feet to square yards
- Changing the area of a rectangle from square inches to square feet
- Converting 1 square mile to square kilometers"
487,Believes a composite function multiplies the functions together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of composite functions in algebra. They mistakenly believe that when two functions are composed, it means that the functions are multiplied together. This can be due to the fact that the notation for composite functions, f(g(x)), is often confused with the notation for multiplication. As a result, students may think that the composite function f(g(x)) is equal to f(x) multiplied by g(x).

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to composite functions and are not fully clear on the concept.
- When working with simple functions, such as f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 3x, where the result of f(g(x)) = 6x might lead students to believe that the functions are being multiplied.
- When solving problems that involve composite functions with numerical coefficients, such as f(x) = 2x and g(x) = 4x, where students might mistakenly multiply the coefficients together.
- When dealing with more complex functions, such as trigonometric functions or polynomial functions, where the composition of functions can be more difficult to understand."
488,Does not correctly apply the distributive property of multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to properly distribute a single term across the terms inside the parentheses, or when they incorrectly apply the distributive property in various mathematical contexts. The distributive property states that for any numbers a, b, and c, a(b + c) = ab + ac. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly apply this rule or not apply it at all.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions like 2(x + 3), where students might write 2x + 3 instead of 2x + 6.
- Expanding equations like 3(x - 2), where students may write 3x - 2 instead of 3x - 6.
- Solving problems like 4(2x + 1), where students might write 8x + 1 instead of 8x + 4.
- Evaluating expressions like (x + 2)(3 + 4), where students may not distribute correctly, leading to incorrect results.
- Solving algebraic equations like 2(x + 1) = 6, where students with this misconception may struggle to isolate the variable x due to incorrect application of the distributive property."
489,Believes speed = time/distance,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly reverse the formula for speed. They may think that speed is equal to time divided by distance, rather than the correct formula: speed = distance/time. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of the concept of speed.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the speed of an object and the student is given the time taken and distance traveled, they may write the formula as speed = time/distance.
- When comparing the speeds of two objects, the student may incorrectly conclude that the object with the longer time has the greater speed if the distance is the same.
- When solving problems involving speed, distance, and time, the student may consistently get the wrong answer due to using the incorrect formula.
- When asked to graph the relationship between speed, distance, and time, the student's graph may reflect the incorrect formula, leading to a misinterpretation of the data."
490,"Believes that when constructing triangles, all sides should be measured from the same point","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of constructing triangles using a ruler and protractor or compass. They believe that to construct a triangle, all sides must be measured from the same fixed point, often the starting vertex of the triangle. This misconception may stem from an overemphasis on measuring lengths from a fixed point in other areas of geometry or a lack of understanding of how triangles can be constructed using different methods.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When constructing an isosceles triangle, students may attempt to measure both equal sides from the same vertex, rather than understanding that the equal sides can be measured from different vertices.
- When constructing a triangle using the SSS (side-side-side) criterion, students may try to measure all three sides from the same point, rather than understanding that each side can be measured between different pairs of vertices.
- When constructing right-angled triangles, students may attempt to measure the hypotenuse and the other two sides from the same point, rather than understanding that the hypotenuse is measured between the two vertices that form the right angle."
491,Does not know how to calculate the mean,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unsure of how to find the mean of a set of numbers, often due to a lack of understanding of the concept or a failure to apply the correct formula. The mean, also known as the average, is a measure of central tendency that represents the sum of all values divided by the number of values. 

Students with this misconception may struggle with the steps involved in calculating the mean, such as adding up the numbers, counting the total number of values, or dividing the sum by the count. They may also get confused with other measures of central tendency, like the median or mode.

This misconception can occur in various situations, including:

- Case 1: When given a simple set of numbers, such as the scores of a test (e.g., 5, 7, 3, 9), and asked to find the mean score.
- Case 2: When dealing with real-life data, such as the average height of students in a class, and needing to calculate the mean height from a list of individual heights.
- Case 3: When working with more complex data sets, like a list of exam scores with varying weights or multiple sets of numbers to be averaged together."
492,"Believes the graph of x squared + c has the turning point of (c, 0)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the value of 'c' in the equation x^2 + c directly affects the x-coordinate of the turning point, also known as the vertex, of the parabola. They incorrectly assume that the x-coordinate of the turning point is equal to 'c', and the y-coordinate is always 0.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are graphing quadratic functions of the form x^2 + c and mistakenly plot the turning point at (c, 0) instead of finding the actual vertex.
- When solving problems that involve finding the vertex of a parabola, students may incorrectly substitute 'c' as the x-coordinate of the vertex.
- When comparing the graphs of different quadratic functions, such as x^2 + 2 and x^2 + 4, students may incorrectly assume that the turning points are at (2, 0) and (4, 0) respectively.
- When applying quadratic functions to real-world problems, such as projectile motion or optimization problems, students may misinterpret the results due to their misconception about the turning point."
493,Thinks you add the number of wholes to the numerator when converting a mixed number to an improper fraction.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting a mixed number (a combination of a whole number and a fraction) to an improper fraction (a fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator). The misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to convert a mixed number, they should simply add the whole number part to the numerator, without considering the actual relationship between the whole and the fraction.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting 2 3/4 to an improper fraction, a student may incorrectly think that the improper fraction is 5/4 (adding 2 to 3, instead of multiplying the whole number by the denominator and then adding the numerator).
- When converting 3 2/5 to an improper fraction, a student may incorrectly think that the improper fraction is 5/5 (adding 3 to 2, instead of multiplying the whole number by the denominator and then adding the numerator).
- When converting 1 1/2 to an improper fraction, a student may incorrectly think that the improper fraction is 2/2 (adding 1 to 1, instead of multiplying the whole number by the denominator and then adding the numerator)."
494,"When comparing data, only compares one category of data rather than comparing the totals","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students focus on a single category or aspect of the data, rather than considering the overall totals or broader trends. They might compare the values within a specific category, but fail to account for the cumulative effect or the bigger picture. This narrow focus can lead to inaccurate conclusions or incomplete understanding of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a survey about favorite fruits, students compare the number of people who like apples to those who like bananas, but fail to consider the total number of people surveyed.
- Case 2: When analyzing the scores of different teams in a sports league, students compare the number of wins for one team to the number of wins for another team, without considering the total number of games played.
- Case 3: In a bar graph showing the number of books read by different classes, students compare the number of books read by one class to another, but don't account for the total number of students in each class.
- Case 4: When looking at a pie chart of a budget, students compare the amount spent on one category (e.g., entertainment) to another category (e.g., food), without considering the overall budget total."
495,Thinks converting an integer to a fraction means both the numerator and denominator are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting an integer into a fraction involves making both the numerator and the denominator equal to the integer. For instance, they might think that converting the integer 5 into a fraction would result in 5/5, which is indeed correct but not for the reason they think. They might apply this logic to other situations where it doesn't hold, thinking that this is the rule for converting integers to fractions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting integers to fractions, such as thinking that 3 as a fraction is only 3/3, not realizing 3 can also be 6/2, 9/3, etc.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with integers, such as 3 + 1/4, where students might incorrectly convert 3 into 3/3 and struggle with finding a common denominator.
- When comparing fractions, such as comparing 3 to 2/3, where students might incorrectly convert 3 to 3/3 and make incorrect conclusions about the relative sizes of the fractions."
496,"When subtracting decimals with a different number of decimals, subtracts one digit from more than one column","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are subtracting decimals with a different number of decimal places. They may incorrectly align the numbers and perform the subtraction as if they were whole numbers, not taking into account the place value of each digit. As a result, they may subtract one digit from more than one column, leading to an incorrect answer.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- 4.5 - 2.07: A student may incorrectly subtract 7 from 5 and then borrow from the 4, rather than correctly aligning the numbers and subtracting 0.07 from 4.50.
- 10.2 - 4.095: A student may incorrectly subtract 5 from 2 and then borrow from the 10, rather than correctly aligning the numbers and subtracting 0.095 from 10.200.
- 7.85 - 3.2: A student may incorrectly subtract 2 from 5 and then borrow from the 7, rather than correctly aligning the numbers and subtracting 3.20 from 7.85."
497,Used the digits of the decimal as the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use the digits of a decimal as the denominator of a fraction, rather than understanding the place value of the decimal. For example, if the decimal is 0.4, the student may incorrectly assume that the denominator is 4, rather than recognizing that 0.4 is equivalent to 4/10.

This misconception can lead to incorrect conversions between decimals and fractions, and can also cause confusion when performing arithmetic operations with decimals.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting decimals to fractions (e.g., 0.5 is incorrectly written as 5/5 rather than 5/10 or 1/2).
- When adding or subtracting decimals (e.g., 0.3 + 0.4 is incorrectly calculated as 3/3 + 4/4 rather than 3/10 + 4/10).
- When multiplying or dividing decimals (e.g., 0.2 × 0.5 is incorrectly calculated as 2/2 × 5/5 rather than 2/10 × 5/10).
- When comparing or ordering decimals (e.g., 0.3 is incorrectly considered greater than 0.4 because 3 is greater than 4)."
498,Does not understand that in a ratio 1:n that one part of the ratio would be n times bigger than the one part,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret a ratio as simply a comparison between two quantities without fully understanding the relationship between the parts. In the case of a ratio 1:n, they may not recognize that the second part is actually n times larger than the first part. Instead, they might view the ratio as just a simple pairing of numbers, without considering the proportional relationship between them.

For example, in the following cases, this misconception may occur:

- When comparing the ratio of ingredients in a recipe, a student might think that if a recipe calls for a ratio of 1 part sugar to 3 parts flour, the amount of flour is just ""more"" than the sugar, without realizing that it is actually three times the amount of sugar.
- When scaling up or down a model or a drawing, a student might not understand that if the ratio of the original to the scaled version is 1:4, the scaled version is actually four times larger than the original.
- When working with equivalent ratios, a student might not recognize that a ratio of 1:5 is equivalent to 2:10 or 3:15, and that the second part is always five times larger than the first part, regardless of the specific numbers used.
- When solving problems involving proportions, a student might set up an incorrect proportion, such as 1/2 = 2/3, without realizing that the second part of the ratio is not just ""more"" than the first part, but actually a specific multiple of it."
499,Does not realise ratio in worded problem can be simplified,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with word problems involving ratios and they fail to recognize that the ratio can be simplified, making the problem easier to solve. Students might think that the ratio given in the problem is absolute and cannot be altered, or they might not understand that simplifying the ratio does not change its value. As a result, they might struggle with calculations, leading to incorrect answers or unnecessary complications.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When sharing a certain quantity in a given ratio, students might insist on using the original ratio numbers, even if they have common factors that can be cancelled out.
* In scaling recipes up or down, students might not realize that the ratio of ingredients can be simplified, making it easier to adjust the quantities.
* When comparing proportions, students might not simplify the ratios, making it harder to identify equivalent proportions.
* In map scales or model representations, students might not recognize that the ratio of the scale can be simplified, leading to difficulties in calculating actual distances or sizes."
500,Finds the shaded section rather than the specified section,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a specific section or area in a geometric shape, but instead, they focus on the shaded section, even if it's not the section being asked about. This can happen when students are not carefully reading or understanding the question, or when they are relying too heavily on visual cues rather than the actual problem statement.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* In a question asking for the area of a specific part of a circle, students might find the area of the shaded sector instead of the specified sector.
* When finding the perimeter of a shape with a shaded section, students might include the shaded section in their calculation, even if it's not part of the shape's perimeter.
* In a problem involving finding the volume of a 3D shape with a shaded section, students might focus on finding the volume of the shaded section instead of the entire shape.
* When asked to find the length of a specific segment in a geometric figure, students might find the length of a shaded segment instead, even if it's not the segment being asked about."
501,Uses tan when cos is required,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with trigonometric ratios in right-angled triangles, particularly when trying to find the length of a side adjacent to a given angle. They mistakenly use the tangent (tan) ratio, which is opposite side divided by adjacent side, instead of the cosine (cos) ratio, which is adjacent side divided by hypotenuse. This may happen because students often struggle to recall the definitions of the different trigonometric ratios or fail to identify the correct sides of the triangle in relation to the given angle.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Finding the length of a shadow of an object given the height of the object and the angle of elevation of the sun.
- Calculating the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle in a construction problem.
- Solving a problem involving a right triangle in a physics or engineering context, such as resolving forces or finding distances.
- Determining the length of a side in a triangle when given two angles and a side.
- Finding the distance between two points on a coordinate plane using trigonometry."
502,Believes multiplying a number by its square root gives the square root,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between multiplication, square roots, and squares. They may incorrectly assume that multiplying a number by its square root 'cancels out' the square, leaving only the square root. For example, they might think that 4 * √4 = √4, rather than recognizing that 4 * √4 is actually equal to 4 * 2, which equals 8.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, like √x * x.
- When solving geometric problems involving area and perimeter of squares, circles, or other shapes.
- When working with data and statistics, such as calculating standard deviations or variances.
- When dealing with real-world applications, like calculating distances, velocities, or forces in physics.
- In word problems, such as ""If a square garden has an area of 16 square meters, and the length of one side is multiplied by its square root, what is the new length of the side?"""
503,Ignores partial symbols on pictograms,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students interpret pictograms but fail to account for partial symbols that represent a fraction of a whole. Pictograms are often used in data representation to make information more visual and accessible. However, when a pictogram includes a partial symbol (e.g., a half or a quarter of a symbol) to indicate a fraction of the quantity it represents, some students might overlook or misunderstand the partial symbol. They may only count whole symbols, leading to inaccurate interpretations of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A pictogram shows 3.5 symbols to represent the number of books read by a class, with each symbol representing 5 books. A student ignoring the half symbol might conclude that the class read 15 books instead of the correct 17.5 books.

2. A weather chart uses pictograms to show the amount of rainfall, with each symbol representing 2 mm of rain. If a day has 2.25 symbols, a student who ignores the quarter symbol might think it rained 4 mm instead of the correct 4.5 mm.

3. A survey result is represented by pictograms, where each symbol represents 10 people. If a partial symbol (e.g., 0.75) is used to indicate a fraction of the group, a student who overlooks this might misinterpret the total number of people in the group."
504,"Given the mean and the amount of numbers, adds to find the total","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the mean. They may believe that to find the total sum of a set of numbers, they can simply add the mean to itself as many times as there are numbers in the set, rather than multiplying the mean by the number of items. This error shows a lack of understanding of how the mean is calculated (sum of all values divided by the number of values) and how it relates to the total sum.

Examples of when this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A student is given that the mean of 5 numbers is 8 and is asked to find the total sum of the 5 numbers. They may incorrectly add 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 instead of multiplying 8 by 5.

- Case 2: In a data set with 10 numbers and a mean of 12, a student might attempt to find the total by repeatedly adding 12, rather than recognizing the need to multiply 12 by 10.

- Case 3: Given a mean of 6 for a set of 8 numbers, a student may incorrectly find the total by adding 6 eight times, instead of simply multiplying 6 by 8."
505,Believes finding the product of two numbers gives their lowest common multiple,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the lowest common multiple (LCM) and confuse it with the product of two numbers. They may think that multiplying two numbers together will automatically give them the LCM, without realizing that the LCM is actually the smallest multiple that both numbers share. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate the LCM, especially when dealing with numbers that have common factors.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the LCM of 4 and 6, students may multiply 4 and 6 to get 24, which is actually the product, but also coincidentally the LCM in this case, reinforcing their misconception.
- When finding the LCM of 10 and 20, students may multiply 10 and 20 to get 200, which is not the LCM (the actual LCM is 20).
- When solving problems that involve finding the LCM of two numbers to determine a common interval or frequency, such as finding the LCM of 15 and 20 to determine when two events will coincide."
506,Believes that multiplying variables is the same as adding them together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental difference between addition and multiplication operations, particularly when dealing with variables. They may incorrectly assume that when variables are multiplied, their values are simply added together. This misunderstanding is often rooted in the students' lack of comprehension of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition, and their inability to generalize this concept to variable expressions.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When simplifying algebraic expressions, e.g., 2x * 3x, students may think the result is 5x instead of 6x^2.
* When solving equations, e.g., x * 2 = 6, students may believe x is equal to 4 (2 + 2) instead of 3.
* When working with formulas, e.g., the area of a rectangle (A = length * width), students may think that multiplying the length and width is the same as adding them together.
* When expanding expressions, e.g., (x + 2) * (x + 3), students may incorrectly simplify the result by adding the terms instead of multiplying them."
507,Believes the total frequency is the overall total in a grouped table,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the total frequency in a grouped table represents the overall total of the individual data values, rather than the total number of data values within each group. They may incorrectly assume that the total frequency is the sum of all the data values, rather than the sum of the number of times each group of data values occurs.

For example, consider a grouped table showing the number of students who scored certain ranges of marks in a test:

| Marks | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| 0-20 | 5 |
| 21-40 | 8 |
| 41-60 | 12 |
| 61-80 | 10 |
| 81-100 | 6 |
| Total | 41 |

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to find the total score of all the students and incorrectly adds the frequencies (5 + 8 + 12 + 10 + 6) to get the total score.
- A student is given a grouped table showing the number of hours spent watching TV per day and incorrectly assumes that the total frequency represents the total number of hours spent watching TV.
- A student is asked to calculate the mean of a dataset from a grouped table and incorrectly uses the total frequency as the sum of the data values."
508,Thinks there are 1000 seconds in an hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that there are 1000 seconds in an hour, likely due to a misunderstanding of the metric system or the conversion between units of time. They may be incorrectly applying the idea of 1000 units from the metric system (e.g., 1000 grams in a kilogram, 1000 meters in a kilometer) to the measurement of time. As a result, they may think that 1 hour (60 minutes) is equivalent to 1000 seconds, rather than the correct 3600 seconds.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting between units of time, such as from hours to seconds.
- When solving problems involving time calculations, such as finding the total time it takes to complete a task or the time elapsed between events.
- When interpreting time-related data, such as understanding the duration of an event or the frequency of occurrences within a given time frame.
- When comparing time intervals, such as determining which event is longer or shorter in duration."
509,Believes speed is distance multiplied by time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between speed, distance, and time. They incorrectly assume that speed is the product of distance and time, rather than understanding that speed is actually the rate of change of distance with respect to time, or distance divided by time. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the units and dimensions involved in the calculation of speed, or a failure to grasp the concept of rate and ratio.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When asked to calculate the speed of an object that travels a certain distance in a given time, a student with this misconception may multiply the distance by the time, resulting in an incorrect answer with the wrong units (e.g., meters squared per second instead of meters per second).
- When comparing the speeds of two objects, a student with this misconception may conclude that the object that travels the greatest distance in the longest time has the highest speed, rather than recognizing that speed is a rate that depends on the ratio of distance to time.
- When solving problems involving constant acceleration or deceleration, a student with this misconception may struggle to correctly calculate the speed of an object at different points in time, leading to incorrect conclusions about the object's motion."
510,Believes that a positive x squared coefficient in a quadratic equation results in an n shaped graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly associate the sign of the x squared coefficient with the shape of the parabola, but incorrectly identify it as an 'n' shape. They may understand that the coefficient of x squared determines the direction the parabola opens, but mistakenly think it results in an 'n' shape, which is actually not the case. They might not fully grasp the concept that a positive x squared coefficient results in a parabola that opens upwards, resembling a 'u' shape, while a negative x squared coefficient results in a parabola that opens downwards, resembling an inverted 'u' shape.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:
1. Graphing a quadratic equation, such as y = x^2 + 2x + 1, where the student expects an 'n' shaped graph.
2. Solving quadratic equations, such as x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0, where the student incorrectly visualizes the graph as an 'n' shape.
3. Analyzing real-world problems modeled by quadratic equations, such as projectile motion, where the student misinterprets the shape of the trajectory as an 'n' shape due to a positive x squared coefficient."
511,Ignores the negative sign when thinking about the value of a term,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard the negative sign in front of a number or variable, treating it as if it were positive. They may focus solely on the magnitude of the value, ignoring the direction or sign indicated by the negative sign. This can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations in various mathematical contexts.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: When simplifying expressions like -3x or -2y, students may ignore the negative sign and treat the term as positive, resulting in incorrect simplified forms.
2. Solving equations: In equations like -x = 5, students may disregard the negative sign and solve for x as if the equation were x = 5, leading to an incorrect solution.
3. Graphing: When graphing functions with negative coefficients, students may ignore the negative sign and graph the function as if it were positive, resulting in an incorrect graph.
4. Inequalities: In inequalities like -x > 3, students may overlook the negative sign and solve the inequality as if it were x > 3, leading to an incorrect solution.
5. Word problems: In word problems involving negative numbers, such as temperatures or financial transactions, students may ignore the negative sign and treat the value as positive, resulting in incorrect answers."
512,"When asked to solve simultaneous equations, believes they can just find values that work in one equation","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that the solution to a system of simultaneous equations requires finding values that satisfy both equations simultaneously. They might find a value that works for one equation, but neglect to check if it also works for the other equation. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of simultaneity, where students think that finding a solution to one equation is enough, without realizing that the solution must also be valid for the other equation.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When dealing with simple linear equations, such as 2x + 3y = 5 and x + 2y = 3, students might find a value of x that works for the first equation, but not check if it also works for the second equation.
* When solving systems of equations with the same variable, such as x + y = 4 and 2x + 2y = 8, students might assume that because the first equation has a solution, it will automatically work for the second equation.
* When working with word problems that involve simultaneous equations, such as ""Tom has 15 pencils and 20 pens, and he wants to put them into boxes that hold 3 pencils and 4 pens each. How many boxes can he fill?"", students might focus on solving one equation, such as the number of pencils, without considering the other equation, the number of pens."
513,Believes they need to multiply the numbers together in a worded HCF question ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with a worded question involving the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers. They may mistakenly believe that the operation required to find the answer is multiplication, rather than finding the common factor. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of HCF or a lack of experience in solving worded problems.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: ""Tom has 18 pencils and 24 pens to pack into boxes. What is the largest number of items that Tom can put in each box so that there are no items left over?"" A student with this misconception might multiply 18 and 24 to get 432, thinking that this is the answer.
- Case 2: ""A bookshelf has 12 books on each shelf, and there are 18 shelves in total. If the books need to be packed into boxes, with the same number of books in each box, what is the largest number of books that can be packed in each box?"" The student might multiply 12 and 18 to get 216, which is incorrect.
- Case 3: ""A bakery has 24 cupcakes and 36 muffins to package for a party. What is the largest number of baked goods that can be put in each package so that there are no items left over?"" The student might multiply 24 and 36 to get 864, which is not the correct answer."
514,Believes 0.5absin(c) requires only three sides (potentially confused with cosine rule),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the formula 0.5absin(c) (which is actually the formula for the area of a triangle using two sides and the included angle) requires only three sides, similar to the cosine rule. The cosine rule is used to find the length of a side in a triangle when all three sides and one angle, or two sides and two angles are known, using the formula c² = a² + b² - 2abcos(C). Students may confuse the two formulas, thinking that 0.5absin(c) is another version of the cosine rule, and thus, incorrectly assume that it can be applied with only three sides. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:
- When students are asked to find the area of a triangle and they are given three sides, but no information about the included angle.
- When students are given a problem involving a right-angled triangle and they incorrectly apply 0.5absin(c) using the lengths of the sides, instead of recognizing that it requires two sides and the included angle.
- When students are given a problem involving the cosine rule and they incorrectly substitute 0.5absin(c) into the solution, thinking it is equivalent."
515,Does not know a rectangle is a type of parallelogram ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of the definition of a parallelogram. They may think that a parallelogram is only a quadrilateral with opposite sides that are parallel and not equal in length, and with angles that are not right angles. They may not realize that a rectangle, which has opposite sides of equal length and right angles, also meets the criteria of a parallelogram.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying and classifying different types of quadrilaterals, students may not include rectangles in the category of parallelograms.
- When asked to provide examples of parallelograms, students may only provide examples of non-rectangular parallelograms, such as a rhomboid or a trapezoid with a pair of parallel sides.
- When solving problems that involve properties of parallelograms, such as finding the area or perimeter, students may not apply these properties to rectangles, thinking that they are a separate category of shapes.
- When given a diagram of a rectangle and asked to identify the type of quadrilateral it is, students may not recognize it as a type of parallelogram."
516,Thinks the inverse of multiplication is addition,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the opposite operation of multiplication is addition, rather than division. In other words, they may think that to ""undo"" multiplication, they need to add a number, rather than divide by that number. For example, if they have a problem like 5 × 3, they might think that to get back to the original value, they need to add 3, rather than divide by 3.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When solving equations: A student might write 5 × 3 + 3 to ""get rid of"" the multiplication, rather than 5 × 3 ÷ 3.
- When working with fractions: A student might think that to simplify a fraction like 6/3, they need to add 3 to the numerator, rather than dividing the numerator by 3.
- When solving word problems: A student might read a problem like ""Tom has 5 groups of 3 pencils each. How many groups does he have if he wants to put the pencils into groups of 1?"" and think that they need to add 3 to the total number of pencils to solve it.
- When simplifying expressions: A student might simplify an expression like 2 × 3 + 4 by adding 3 to the result of the multiplication, rather than following the order of operations.
- When working with real-world applications: A student might be given a problem like ""A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 boxes. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many boxes can be placed on it in total?"" and think that they need to add 3 to the total number of boxes to find the answer."
517,Assumes triangles are isosceles if they look like they are isosceles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students rely too heavily on visual inspection to determine the properties of a triangle. They may believe that if a triangle appears to be symmetrical or has two sides that look roughly equal in length, then it must be an isosceles triangle. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify triangles as isosceles without actually measuring or verifying the lengths of the sides.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or sketching triangles freehand, students may inadvertently create triangles that appear to be isosceles but actually are not.
- When working with diagrams or pictures of triangles that are not drawn to scale, students may misjudge the lengths of the sides based on appearance.
- When solving problems that involve identifying types of triangles, students may quickly glance at a triangle and assume it is isosceles without taking the time to verify the side lengths.
- When real-world objects or structures resemble isosceles triangles but actually have slightly different side lengths, students may incorrectly assume they are isosceles based on appearance alone."
518,Thinks that to decrease by a percentage you multiply by 1+ the decimal equivalent to that percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with the concept of increasing a quantity by a certain percentage, where they multiply the original value by 1 plus the decimal equivalent of the percentage (e.g., increasing by 20% by multiplying by 1.2). However, when it comes to decreasing a quantity by a percentage, they incorrectly apply the same logic, thinking that multiplying by 1 plus the decimal equivalent will give the correct result. In reality, this would actually increase the quantity, not decrease it.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A shirt is on sale for 20% off its original price of $50. A student may think that to find the sale price, they need to multiply $50 by 1.2 (1 + 0.2), resulting in an incorrect sale price of $60.
- A store is offering a 10% discount on all electronics. A student may calculate the discount price of a $100 laptop by multiplying $100 by 1.1 (1 + 0.1), getting an incorrect discount price of $110.
- A bakery is having a 15% off sale on all cakes. A student may think that to find the sale price of a cake originally priced at $80, they need to multiply $80 by 1.15 (1 + 0.15), resulting in an incorrect sale price of $92."
519,"When asked for factors of an algebraic expression, thinks a term will be a factor","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the factors of an algebraic expression, but they mistakenly identify individual terms as factors. They may believe that each term in the expression can be a factor on its own, rather than considering the entire expression and finding the common factors that divide the expression evenly. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of understanding of what constitutes a factor in algebra, where factors are the expressions that can be multiplied together to produce the original expression.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When factoring quadratic expressions, a student might think that the terms 'x' and '3' are factors of the expression 'x^2 + 3x', rather than looking for two binomial factors that multiply to the original expression.
- When asked to factor the expression 'x^2 + 4x + 4', a student might incorrectly identify the terms 'x^2', '4x', and '4' as factors, rather than recognizing that the expression can be factored as '(x+2)(x+2)'.
- When working with expressions containing multiple variables, a student might mistakenly identify individual terms as factors, such as thinking that 'x' and 'y' are factors of the expression 'x^2y + 3xy', rather than finding the common factors that divide the entire expression."
520,Thinks the inverse of addition is multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the opposite operation of addition is multiplication, rather than subtraction. In other words, they think that to ""undo"" an addition operation, they need to multiply by a certain number, rather than subtracting the same number. This misconception can lead to errors in calculations and problem-solving, particularly in algebraic expressions and equations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving simple equations, such as 2x + 3 = 5, where the student may try to multiply both sides by a certain number to isolate the variable, rather than subtracting 3 from both sides.
- When working with number sequences, where the student may try to multiply the previous term by a certain number to find the next term, rather than adding or subtracting a fixed constant.
- When solving word problems that involve inverse operations, such as ""Tom has 5 more pencils than Sarah. If Sarah has 3 pencils, how many pencils does Tom have?"" where the student may try to multiply the number of pencils Sarah has by a certain number to find the number of pencils Tom has, rather than adding 5 to the number of pencils Sarah has."
521,"When asked to triple, writes the digit out three times","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of tripling or multiplying a number by three. They incorrectly interpret ""triple"" as writing the digit out three times, rather than understanding it as a multiplication operation that requires adding the number to itself three times or using the multiplication fact. For example, when asked to triple the number 4, students with this misconception might write 444 instead of performing the calculation 4 x 3 = 12.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When a student is asked to triple a single-digit number, such as ""triple 5"" and they write 555 instead of calculating 5 x 3 = 15.
* When a student is given a word problem that involves tripling a quantity, such as ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils. How many pencils does Tom have?"" and they write 444 instead of calculating 4 x 3 = 12.
* When a student is asked to triple a multi-digit number, such as ""triple 14"" and they write 141414 instead of calculating 14 x 3 = 42."
522,Does not count from the centre of enlargement to find the image,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with enlargement transformations in geometry. They may incorrectly assume that the distance from the centre of enlargement to the image is not important or can be measured from a different point. This can lead to incorrect calculations and constructions of enlarged shapes. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the image of a point under an enlargement with a scale factor.
- When constructing an enlarged shape using a centre of enlargement and scale factor.
- When solving problems involving enlargements and calculating distances or lengths of enlarged shapes.
- When describing the effect of an enlargement on the position and size of a shape.
- When finding the scale factor of an enlargement given the object and image."
523,Believes you cannot have a negative gradient when plotting a linear sequence,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to linear sequences and the concept of gradients. They might assume that a gradient, which represents the rate of change, must always be positive, as they may have only been exposed to examples where the sequence increases as the input value increases. They might struggle to understand that a negative gradient represents a downward trend, where the sequence decreases as the input value increases.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When plotting a linear sequence that represents a real-life scenario where a quantity decreases over time, such as the amount of money in a bank account with regular withdrawals.
- When graphing a linear equation with a negative coefficient of x, such as y = -2x + 3.
- When analyzing data that shows a downward trend, such as the relationship between the temperature and altitude.
- When working with word problems that involve a decrease in a quantity, such as a car traveling downhill or a company's profits decreasing over time."
524,Does not understand square root,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the square root of a number is simply the opposite of squaring a number, but they don't fully comprehend the actual operation. They may think that taking the square root of a number means dividing the number by 2 or finding half of it. This lack of understanding can lead to incorrect calculations and a failure to recognize the relationship between squares and square roots.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. When simplifying expressions involving square roots, students may incorrectly simplify √16 as 8 (i.e., 16 ÷ 2) instead of 4.
2. When solving equations involving square roots, students may incorrectly solve √x = 9 as x = 18 (i.e., 9 × 2) instead of x = 81.
3. When comparing the values of square roots, students may incorrectly assume that √25 is greater than √36 because 25 is greater than half of 36.
4. When working with decimal numbers, students may incorrectly calculate the square root of a decimal, such as √0.4, as 0.2 (i.e., 0.4 ÷ 2) instead of approximately 0.632.
5. When applying square roots to real-world problems, students may incorrectly calculate distances, areas, or volumes, leading to incorrect solutions."
525,Does not understand that a surd is a rational number if the number under the root is a square number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that a surd, which is a number expressed as the square root of another number, can be a rational number if the radicand (the number under the root) is a perfect square. Students may incorrectly believe that all surds are irrational numbers, without considering the nature of the radicand.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions with square roots, such as √16 or √25, students may not realize that these surds can be simplified to rational numbers (4 and 5, respectively).
- When solving equations involving square roots, students may assume that the presence of a square root automatically means the solution will be an irrational number.
- When working with geometric problems, such as finding the length of a side of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, students may incorrectly assume that the result will always be an irrational number, even if the radicand is a perfect square.
- When comparing and ordering numbers, students may mistakenly place surds with perfect square radicands in the wrong position on the number line, thinking they are irrational numbers."
526,Thinks there are 10000mm in a km,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to convert between different units of measurement, particularly between millimeters (mm) and kilometers (km). They may be aware that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters, but incorrectly assume that there are 10,000 millimeters in a kilometer instead of correctly converting from meters to millimeters (1 meter = 1000 millimeters). As a result, they may incorrectly calculate the number of millimeters in a kilometer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving problems involving the conversion of distances between kilometers and millimeters, such as calculating the length of a road in millimeters.
- When working with scales or diagrams that involve measurements in both kilometers and millimeters.
- When comparing the lengths of different objects, one measured in kilometers and the other in millimeters.
- When solving real-world problems that require converting between units, such as calculating the distance traveled by a vehicle in millimeters."
527,Does know know equilateral means the same as regular ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the terms ""equilateral"" and ""regular"" can be used interchangeably to describe any polygon. They may think that as long as a shape has equal sides, it is both equilateral and regular. However, the key point they miss is that while all equilateral shapes do have equal sides, not all shapes with equal sides are regular. 

For an equilateral shape, it is indeed a requirement that all sides are equal in length. On the other hand, for a shape to be considered regular, it must not only have equal sides, but also equal angles. This nuance is often overlooked by students who have this misconception.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When describing a rectangle with equal side lengths: A student might call it a regular rectangle, simply because it has equal sides, without realizing that a rectangle by definition has unequal angles (90 degrees and 90 degrees, but not all equal angles) and therefore cannot be regular.

2. When working with isosceles or equilateral triangles: Students may use the terms equilateral and regular triangle interchangeably without understanding the specific properties of each type of triangle.

3. When classifying different polygons: Students may incorrectly label polygons as regular simply because they have equal side lengths, without checking if the angles are also equal."
528,Does not think that a variable with no coefficient has a coefficient of 1.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that a variable with no visible coefficient in an algebraic expression or equation actually has an implied coefficient of 1. This can lead to errors when simplifying expressions, solving equations, or interpreting formulas. Students may think that only variables with a number explicitly written in front of them have coefficients, and variables standing alone do not.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: The student may struggle to simplify expressions like '2x + x' because they do not recognize that 'x' has a coefficient of 1, making it difficult to combine like terms.

2. Solving equations: When solving equations like 'x + 3 = 5', the student may not understand that 'x' has a coefficient of 1, which can affect how they isolate the variable.

3. Interpreting formulas: In formulas like 'A = bh' for the area of a triangle, the student might not recognize that 'b' and 'h' both have implied coefficients of 1, leading to misunderstandings about how to apply the formula.

4. Multiplying or dividing expressions: When multiplying or dividing expressions involving variables with no visible coefficients, the student may not take into account the implied coefficient of 1, leading to incorrect results.

5. Factoring expressions: The student may encounter difficulties factoring expressions like 'x^2 + 3x' because they do not recognize that 'x^2' and 'x' both have coefficients, albeit one is implied as 1."
529,Believes cumulative frequency is the product rather than sum of frequencies,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of cumulative frequency, which is the running total of frequencies in a dataset. They incorrectly believe that to find the cumulative frequency, they need to multiply the frequencies of each class or group, rather than adding them up. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a distorted understanding of the data distribution.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When constructing a cumulative frequency table from a frequency table, a student may multiply the frequencies instead of adding them, resulting in an incorrect cumulative frequency column.
- When interpreting a histogram or cumulative frequency graph, a student may misread the scale, thinking that the cumulative frequency is the product of the frequencies rather than the sum.
- When solving problems involving cumulative frequency, such as finding the median or quartiles, a student may incorrectly apply the multiplication concept, leading to incorrect answers."
530,Confuses the formulas for the circumference of a full circle and the perimeter of a sector,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to differentiate between the formulas for the circumference of a full circle and the perimeter of a sector. The circumference of a full circle is given by 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle. On the other hand, the perimeter of a sector is given by the sum of the length of the arc and twice the radius, which is (θ/360) × 2πr + 2r, where θ is the angle subtended by the sector at the center of the circle.

This misconception often leads students to incorrectly apply the formula for the circumference of a full circle to find the perimeter of a sector, or vice versa. For instance, they might use the formula 2πr to find the perimeter of a sector, neglecting the fact that the sector has an additional two radii that contribute to its perimeter.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Finding the perimeter of a sector with a given angle and radius.
2. Calculating the length of a fence needed to enclose a circular garden with a sector-shaped entrance.
3. Determining the total distance around a circular path with a sector-shaped detour.
4. Solving problems involving the perimeter of a sector in real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering.
5. Comparing the perimeters of different sectors with varying angles and radii."
531,Thinks when finding a percentage you multiply by the percentage being asked,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a percentage of a given quantity. They mistakenly believe that to find the percentage, they simply multiply the quantity by the percentage being asked, without converting the percentage to a decimal or fraction first. For example, if asked to find 25% of 200, they might multiply 200 by 25, resulting in an incorrect answer of 5000.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Finding a percentage increase or decrease in a quantity, e.g., ""A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of $80. How much will you pay for the shirt?""
- Calculating the percentage of a total, e.g., ""A student scored 72 out of 100 on a test. What percentage did they score?""
- Determining the percentage of a population, e.g., ""A survey found that 35% of the students in a school like pizza. If there are 500 students, how many like pizza?""
- Finding a percentage of a measurement, e.g., ""A recipe requires a 20% increase in water. If the original amount of water is 250ml, how much water is needed now?"""
532,Confuses alternate and opposite angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between alternate and opposite angles, often leading to incorrect identifications and calculations. Alternate angles are those that are on opposite sides of the transversal line and inside the two lines, but not adjacent to each other. On the other hand, opposite angles, also known as vertical angles, are those that are directly opposite each other at the point of intersection. Students may mistakenly assume that these two types of angles are the same or confuse their properties.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When identifying angles in a diagram, students might incorrectly label alternate angles as opposite angles or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving angle calculations, students may apply the wrong properties, such as assuming that alternate angles are always equal, when in fact, it's the opposite angles that are equal.
- In geometric proofs, students may mistakenly use alternate angles instead of opposite angles to establish congruence or similarity between triangles.
- In real-world applications, such as designing buildings or bridges, misunderstanding the difference between alternate and opposite angles can lead to critical errors in structural calculations and stability assessments."
533,Does not consider the variable when evaluating an expression that requires substitution.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to substitute values into an algebraic expression, but they fail to account for the variable in the expression. Instead, they might simply plug in the given value without considering the operation that the variable is involved in. This can lead to incorrect simplification or evaluation of the expression. 

For example, cases where this misconception may occur include:

- When substituting a negative value for a variable and failing to distribute it correctly, e.g., 2x when x = -3.
- When there are multiple instances of the variable in the expression, e.g., 2x + 3x when x = 4.
- When the variable is involved in a mathematical operation, such as squaring or cubing, e.g., 2x^2 when x = 5.
- When the variable is in the denominator of a fraction, e.g., 1/x when x = 2."
534,Does not understand what an interior angle is,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of an interior angle in geometry. An interior angle is the angle formed by two sides of a shape that meet at a vertex and lie within the shape. Students with this misconception may have difficulty identifying and measuring interior angles in various geometric shapes, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons.

They may mistakenly consider exterior angles, which are angles formed by one side of the shape and an extension of an adjacent side, as interior angles. This misconception can lead to errors in calculating the sum of interior angles in different shapes and solving problems involving interior angles.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Identifying and measuring interior angles in a triangle, such as calculating the sum of interior angles (180 degrees) or determining if a triangle is acute, right, or obtuse.
- Finding the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral (360 degrees) or other polygons.
- Solving problems involving interior angles in real-life applications, such as designing buildings or bridges.
- Determining the number of sides in a polygon given the sum of its interior angles.
- Comparing interior angles in different shapes, such as equilateral triangles or regular polygons."
535,Believes a missing length on a cuboid can be found by doing volume divided by a different length,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of volume and how it relates to the dimensions of a 3D shape, such as a cuboid. They incorrectly assume that to find a missing length, they can simply divide the volume by one of the other lengths, without considering the actual formula for volume of a cuboid (length x width x height). This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between the dimensions of a 3D shape and its volume, or from over-simplifying the formula for volume.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the length of a bookshelf when the volume and two other dimensions are given.
- Calculating the height of a rectangular prism when the volume and the length and width are provided.
- Determining the width of a storage box when the volume and the length and height are known."
536,Ignores coefficients when forming an expression from a question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard the coefficients (numerical values) associated with variables when creating an algebraic expression from a given problem. Coefficients provide crucial information about the relationship between the variables and constants in an equation, and ignoring them can lead to inaccurate representations of the problem.

For example, this misconception may manifest in the following cases:

- A question states that ""Tom has 3 times as many pencils as his brother, and his brother has x pencils."" A student with this misconception might write the expression as ""Tom has x pencils"" instead of ""Tom has 3x pencils.""
- A problem asks to represent the cost of buying 5 boxes of pens, with each box costing $x. A student with this misconception might write the expression as ""5 + x"" instead of ""5x.""
- A scenario describes a bookshelf with 2 rows of books, and each row has x books. A student with this misconception might write the expression as ""x books"" instead of ""2x books."""
537,Believes you do not need to give the direction when describing a rotation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that simply stating the angle and center of rotation is enough to define a rotation in geometry. They may assume that the direction of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise) is either implied or irrelevant, which is not the case. This misconception can lead to confusion when working with rotations, especially when dealing with multiple rotations or more complex geometric transformations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When describing a rotation in a coordinate plane, a student might say ""rotate 90 degrees around the origin"" without specifying whether it's clockwise or counterclockwise.
- When solving a problem involving rotations, a student might assume that the direction of rotation is always counterclockwise, even if it's not explicitly stated.
- When visualizing a rotation in 3D space, a student might neglect to consider the direction of rotation, leading to incorrect conclusions about the resulting image.
- When working with rotational symmetries, a student might overlook the importance of direction, resulting in incomplete or incorrect identification of symmetries."
538,Does not perform calculations in the numerator of a fraction before division by the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that operations within the numerator of a fraction should be performed before dividing by the denominator. Students with this misconception may treat the numerator as a single entity to be divided by the denominator, rather than simplifying the numerator first. 

For example, when evaluating the expression 6 + 4 / 2, students may divide 4 by 2 and then add 6, but when faced with the expression (6 + 4) / 2, they may simply divide 6 and then add 4, and then divide the result by 2, or divide 6 by 2 and then add 4, rather than adding 6 and 4 first, and then dividing the sum by 2.

This misconception can also occur when the numerator contains multiplication, subtraction, or other operations that need to be performed before dividing by the denominator. It shows a lack of understanding of the order of operations and how it applies to fractions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:
- (5 * 3) / 2 
- (12 - 3) / 4 
- (8 + 2) / 5 
- (9 * 2) / 3"
539,Does not understand the value of zeros as placeholders,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize the importance of zeros as placeholders in numbers, particularly in multi-digit numbers. They may not understand that zeros are used to indicate the absence of a digit in a particular place value, which can lead to incorrect reading, writing, or calculation of numbers.

For example, students with this misconception may:

- Read the number 1005 as ""one hundred five"" instead of ""one thousand and five"".
- Write the number 205 as ""25"" instead of ""205"" because they don't see the importance of the zero in the tens place.
- Compare numbers incorrectly, thinking that 100 is less than 10 because they don't recognize the zero as a placeholder in the tens place.
- Make calculation errors, such as adding or subtracting numbers with zeros as placeholders, because they don't understand the value of the zeros.
- Have difficulty understanding the concept of place value and how it relates to the position of digits in a number.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in various math concepts, such as place value, number operations, and problem-solving, and can affect students' overall understanding of numbers and math concepts."
540,Believes the discriminant must be a perfect square for an equation to have real solutions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the role of the discriminant (b² - 4ac) in determining the nature of the solutions of a quadratic equation (ax² + bx + c = 0). They may think that for the equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be a perfect square, which is not entirely accurate.

This misconception may stem from the fact that when the discriminant is a perfect square, the solutions are rational numbers (can be expressed as a finite decimal or a fraction). However, students may overlook the fact that the discriminant can be any non-negative real number (not necessarily a perfect square) for the equation to have real solutions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When solving quadratic equations using the quadratic formula, students may assume that if the discriminant is not a perfect square, the equation has no real solutions.
* When graphing quadratic functions, students may think that if the discriminant is not a perfect square, the graph will not intersect the x-axis, indicating no real solutions.
* When given quadratic equations with irrational or decimal coefficients, students may believe that the equation has no real solutions because the discriminant is not a perfect square."
541,"When asked to find a missing number in a factor tree, finds any factor of the given number rather than the pair of the factor already given.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to complete a factor tree and they focus solely on finding any factor of the given number, rather than identifying the specific pair that complements the factor already provided. They may list out all the possible factors of the number, but fail to recognize that the correct answer is the one that, when multiplied by the given factor, results in the original number.

For example, if a student is given a factor tree with 24 as the starting number and 4 as the given factor, they might list out all the factors of 24 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24) and choose any one of them, such as 6, without realizing that the correct answer is 6, because 4 x 6 = 24.

Short cases when this misconception will occur:

* Completing a factor tree with a missing factor, e.g. 36 = 6 x ___
* Identifying the missing factor in a multiplication equation, e.g. 5 x ___ = 30, given that 5 is already a factor
* Solving a problem that requires finding the pair of a given factor, e.g. ""If 9 is a factor of 36, what is the other factor?"""
542,Believes constructing a perpendicular gives an angle of 60 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that constructing a perpendicular line creates a 60-degree angle, rather than the correct 90-degree angle. A perpendicular line is a line that intersects another line at a right angle, which is 90 degrees. However, students with this misconception may think that the angle created by drawing a perpendicular line is 60 degrees, possibly due to confusion with equilateral triangles, which have angles of 60 degrees.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are constructing shapes, such as squares or rectangles, and incorrectly label the angles created by perpendicular lines as 60 degrees.
- When students are solving geometry problems that involve finding the angles of a shape, and they mistakenly assume that a perpendicular line creates a 60-degree angle.
- When students are working with triangles, particularly equilateral triangles, and they incorrectly apply the properties of these triangles to other shapes, leading them to believe that perpendicular lines create 60-degree angles."
543,"Thinks that when drawing a plan view, you only include the top layer of the shape","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to create a 2D representation (plan view) of a 3D object. They mistakenly believe that only the topmost layer or surface of the object should be included in the plan view, ignoring any layers or features that may be below or inside. This can result in an incomplete or inaccurate representation of the object.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing a plan view of a multi-story building, students might only include the features of the top floor, neglecting the lower floors.
- When creating a plan view of a 3D shape with internal features, such as a hollow cube, students may only draw the outer surface, omitting the internal cavity.
- When representing a 3D object with multiple overlapping components, students might only include the topmost component in the plan view, disregarding the hidden or underlying parts."
544,When dividing a decimal by a power of 10 adds zeroes to start of the number ignoring the placement of the initial decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of dividing decimals by powers of 10. They incorrectly assume that simply adding zeros to the start of the number will give the correct result, without considering the placement of the initial decimal point. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the decimal point and place value when dividing by powers of 10.

Examples of when this misconception may occur:

- When dividing 4.5 by 10, students may incorrectly think the result is 045 instead of 0.45.
- When dividing 12.3 by 100, students may incorrectly think the result is 0012.3 instead of 0.123.
- When dividing 0.75 by 1000, students may incorrectly think the result is 0000.75 instead of 0.00075."
545,"When given the perimeter of a regular polygon, multiplies instead of divides to find each side length","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the length of each side of a regular polygon, given its perimeter. They incorrectly assume that to find the length of one side, they need to multiply the perimeter by the number of sides, rather than dividing it. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between the perimeter and the number of sides, or a lack of understanding of the concept of division as sharing or grouping.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* A student is given a regular hexagon with a perimeter of 36 cm and asked to find the length of each side. They may incorrectly multiply 36 by 6, getting 216 cm, instead of dividing 36 by 6 to get 6 cm.
* A student is given a regular octagon with a perimeter of 64 cm and asked to find the length of each side. They may incorrectly multiply 64 by 8, getting 512 cm, instead of dividing 64 by 8 to get 8 cm.
* A student is given a regular triangle with a perimeter of 21 cm and asked to find the length of each side. They may incorrectly multiply 21 by 3, getting 63 cm, instead of dividing 21 by 3 to get 7 cm."
546,"After multiplying to get a common denominator, simplifies back to the original fractions","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. They correctly multiply the fractions to obtain a common denominator but then mistakenly simplify the resulting fractions back to their original forms, effectively canceling out the process of finding a common denominator. This indicates a misunderstanding of the purpose of finding a common denominator, which is to facilitate the addition or subtraction of fractions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When adding fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6.
- When subtracting fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 - 1/6.
- When comparing fractions with different denominators, e.g., comparing the size of 1/4 and 1/6.
- When ordering fractions with different denominators from smallest to largest or vice versa.
- When solving mixed-number addition or subtraction problems involving fractions with different denominators."
547,Factorises difference of two squares with the same sign in both brackets,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to factorise an expression that is a difference of two squares, such as x^2 - y^2 or a^2 - b^2. Instead of correctly factorising it as (x + y)(x - y) or (a + b)(a - b), they incorrectly write it as (x + y)(x + y) or (a + b)(a + b). This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the formula for the difference of two squares, which is (x + y)(x - y), not (x + y)(x + y).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
1. Factorising x^2 - 4 as (x + 2)(x + 2) instead of (x + 2)(x - 2).
2. Factorising 9 - y^2 as (3 + y)(3 + y) instead of (3 + y)(3 - y).
3. Factorising a^2 - 16 as (a + 4)(a + 4) instead of (a + 4)(a - 4)."
548,Believes that a fractional index means you need to find the reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to fractional indices, which can be a complex concept for some to grasp. They may mistakenly believe that when they see a fractional index, such as x^(1/2) or x^(3/4), they need to find the reciprocal of the number, rather than understanding that the fractional index represents a root or a power that is a fraction. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the relationship between indices and fractions, or a lack of clear understanding of the concept of fractional indices.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions with fractional indices, such as x^(1/2) or (2x)^(3/4).
- When solving equations involving fractional indices, such as x^(1/2) = 4 or (x^2)^(3/4) = 8.
- When working with problems that involve multiple operations with fractional indices, such as (x^(1/2))^3 or (x^(3/4))^2.
- When applying rules of indices, such as the product rule or quotient rule, to expressions with fractional indices."
549,Incorrectly converted cm to m,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly convert units of measurement from centimeters (cm) to meters (m). The mistake often arises from a lack of understanding of the conversion factor, where 1 meter equals 100 centimeters. As a result, students may either divide or multiply the given measurement in centimeters by an incorrect factor, leading to an inaccurate conversion to meters.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to convert the length of a pencil from 15 cm to meters and incorrectly answers 15 m or 0.015 m instead of 0.15 m.
- Case 2: A student is given the height of a bookshelf as 250 cm and incorrectly converts it to 2.5 m, 25 m, or 0.025 m instead of 2.5 m (which is correct in this case, but the student may have arrived at the correct answer using incorrect reasoning).
- Case 3: A student is asked to convert their height from 120 cm to meters and incorrectly answers 1.2 m, 12 m, or 0.012 m, instead of 1.2 m (which is correct in this case, but the student may have arrived at the correct answer using incorrect reasoning)."
550,"When representing an inequality on a numberline, assumes the filled and unfilled circles have the opposite meaning.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a filled circle on a number line represents an exclusion of the endpoint, while an unfilled or open circle represents the inclusion of the endpoint. In other words, they think that a filled circle means the point is not part of the solution set, and an open circle means it is part of the solution set.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing an inequality such as x ≥ 2, the student might draw an open circle at 2, thinking it means 2 is included, and shade to the right.
- When graphing an inequality such as x > 3, the student might draw a filled circle at 3, thinking it means 3 is excluded, but then mistakenly include the point in the solution set.
- When solving a problem that involves identifying the intervals on a number line that satisfy a given inequality, the student may misinterpret the meaning of the circles and provide an incorrect solution set.
- When comparing the graphs of different inequalities, the student may become confused about the meaning of the filled and unfilled circles, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between the inequalities."
551,Believes a rectangle has four equal sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly attribute the characteristic of a square to a rectangle. They may think that since a square is a type of rectangle, all rectangles must have the same properties as a square, specifically four equal sides. However, this is not the case, as a rectangle is defined as a quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides of equal length, but not necessarily all four sides equal.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or identifying shapes, students may incorrectly label a rectangle as having four equal sides.
- When calculating the perimeter of a rectangle, students may use the same length for all sides, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When comparing the properties of different shapes, students may incorrectly state that a rectangle has the same properties as a square, including four equal sides.
- When solving problems involving the dimensions of a rectangle, such as finding the area or perimeter, students may assume that all sides are equal, leading to incorrect solutions."
552,Thinks the units for speed should not contain a measure of time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental concept of speed as a measure of how fast an object moves, which inherently involves a relationship between distance and time. They may believe that speed is solely a measure of distance, neglecting the critical role of time in defining the rate at which that distance is covered. As a result, they may incorrectly assume that units of speed, such as meters per second (m/s) or kilometers per hour (km/h), should only consist of a distance component, disregarding the time component.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, including:

- Confusing speed with distance, leading to incorrect units or calculations.
- Failing to recognize the importance of time in determining speed, such as assuming that two objects traveling the same distance have the same speed, regardless of the time taken.
- Struggling to convert between different units of speed, such as from meters per second to kilometers per hour, due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between distance and time.

Short cases when this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to calculate the speed of an object that travels 100 meters in 10 seconds. They respond with an answer of ""100 meters"" as the speed, omitting the time component.
- Case 2: A student is given the speed of a car as 60 kilometers per hour and is asked to convert it to meters per second. They incorrectly convert only the distance component, neglecting to adjust the time component.
- Case 3: A student is asked to compare the speeds of two athletes who run the same distance, but one completes it in half the time of the other. The student incorrectly concludes that both athletes have the same speed since they covered the same distance."
553,Confuses an equation with an identity,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between an equation, which is a statement that expresses the equality of two mathematical expressions and is only true for certain values of the variable(s), and an identity, which is a statement that is true for all values of the variable(s). Students may treat all statements with an equals sign as being the same, not realizing that some are only true under specific conditions, while others are universally true.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, students may assume that the equation 2x + 5 = 11 is the same as the identity 2x + 5 = 2x + 5, not recognizing that the first equation is only true for a specific value of x, while the second identity is true for all values of x.
- When solving equations, students may mistakenly add or subtract the same value to both sides of an identity, thinking that it will lead to a new equation, rather than recognizing that the identity remains true regardless of such operations.
- When working with trigonometric expressions, students may confuse the equation sin(x) = 1 with the identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, not understanding that the first equation is only true for specific values of x, while the second identity is true for all values of x."
554,Finds area of one face when asked for volume,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the volume of a three-dimensional object but instead, they calculate the area of one of its faces. This is likely due to the students' lack of understanding of the difference between area (a two-dimensional concept) and volume (a three-dimensional concept). They may be familiar with the formula for finding the area of a rectangle (length x width) and mistakenly apply it to a 3D object, thinking that finding the area of one face is equivalent to finding the volume.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When asked to find the volume of a rectangular prism, a student may multiply the length and width of one face, ignoring the height.
- When asked to find the volume of a cube, a student may find the area of one face (e.g., 4 x 4 = 16) and present that as the volume.
- When solving real-world problems, such as finding the volume of a container or a box, students may focus on the area of one side rather than considering the entire three-dimensional space."
555,Only counts visible edges,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count the number of edges of a three-dimensional shape, but they only count the edges that are visible to them, rather than considering all the edges of the shape, including the hidden ones. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the shape's structure and its unseen features.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When counting the number of edges of a cube, a student may only count the 12 edges that are visible, forgetting about the other edges that are hidden from view.
- When asked to find the total number of edges of a rectangular prism, a student may only count the edges on the front, top, and sides, neglecting the edges on the back and bottom.
- When working with complex shapes, such as polyhedra, students may struggle to visualize and count all the edges, leading them to only count the visible ones."
556,"When describing a translation, counts the corners of squares (including the starting one) rather than the number of jumps between squares.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to describe a translation in terms of the number of units moved. Instead of counting the actual number of units (or jumps) between the starting and ending points, they count the corners of the squares, including the starting square. This results in an incorrect description of the translation, as the student is essentially counting an extra unit.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a student is asked to describe the translation of a shape from one square to another on a grid, and they count the starting square as one unit, resulting in an incorrect description of the translation.
- When a student is given a diagram with a series of connected squares and is asked to describe the translation from one end to the other, but counts each square (including the starting one) rather than the number of jumps between them.
- When a student is working on a problem that involves moving an object a certain number of units on a grid, but counts the starting square as part of the movement, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the total distance moved."
557,Assumes a fact without considering enough examples,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students make a general statement or assumption about a mathematical concept without considering a sufficient number of examples or cases. They may observe a pattern or rule in a few instances and conclude that it applies universally, without thoroughly testing or verifying it. This can lead to incorrect assumptions and a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical principles.

In Number:
- Assuming that all numbers can be divided evenly, based on a few examples of even numbers being divided by 2.
- Believing that all prime numbers are odd, after seeing a few examples of odd prime numbers.

In Algebra:
- Assuming that all equations of the form ax + b = 0 have one solution, based on a few examples with simple coefficients.
- Believing that all quadratic equations have two distinct real solutions, after solving a few examples with simple quadratic equations.

In Data and Statistics:
- Assuming that all data sets follow a specific pattern or distribution, based on a limited sample size.
- Believing that the mean, median, and mode are always equal, after calculating these measures for a few small data sets.

In Geometry:
- Assuming that all shapes with four sides are rectangles, based on a few examples of rectangles.
- Believing that all angles in a triangle are acute, after drawing a few examples of triangles with acute angles.

In Measure:
- Assuming that all containers with the same volume have the same shape, based on a few examples of containers with simple shapes.
- Believing that all objects with the same weight have the same density, after measuring the weight of a few objects with different densities."
558,"When given a term to term sequence with multiple steps, applies one step per term","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a sequence that requires multiple operations to be applied to each term to generate the next term. However, instead of applying all the operations to each term, they incorrectly apply one operation per term, resulting in an incorrect sequence.

For example, consider a sequence where each term is obtained by adding 2 and then multiplying by 3. A student with this misconception may add 2 to the first term to get the second term, and then multiply the second term by 3 to get the third term, rather than adding 2 and then multiplying by 3 for each term.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A sequence is defined as ""add 4, then multiply by 2"" and the student adds 4 to the first term, but only multiplies the second term by 2.
- A sequence starts with 2 and each term is obtained by subtracting 1 and then dividing by 2, but the student subtracts 1 from the first term and only divides the second term by 2.
- A sequence is generated by adding 3, then squaring the result, but the student adds 3 to the first term and only squares the second term."
559,Thinks depth is marked on the cross section of a prism,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with 3D shapes, specifically prisms, and are asked to identify or label the dimensions on a cross-sectional diagram. They mistakenly believe that the depth of the prism is a dimension that should be indicated on the 2D cross-sectional representation. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that students are used to seeing 3D objects in real life and have difficulty visualizing how these objects are represented in 2D diagrams.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to label the dimensions of a rectangular prism on a diagram showing only its cross-section.
- When students are tasked with calculating the volume of a prism and incorrectly attempt to include the depth in their calculations based on the cross-sectional diagram.
- When comparing the dimensions of different prisms and mistakenly include the depth of the prism in their comparisons, based on the cross-sectional representations."
560,Confuses class width and upper bound of the class,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of class width and upper bound in data grouping, particularly in histograms and frequency tables. Class width refers to the range of values within a class or group, whereas the upper bound is the highest value that is included in the class. 

Students with this misconception may think that the class width and upper bound are interchangeable terms or that they represent the same value. They may also believe that the upper bound is the same as the class width, or vice versa.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When reading histograms: A student might think that a class labeled ""10-20"" has an upper bound of 20, when in fact, it might be 19.99 (depending on the type of data), and the class width is 10 (20-10).

2. When constructing frequency tables: A student may group data into classes of ""1-5"", ""6-10"", etc., and incorrectly state that the upper bound of the first class is 5, when it could be 5.99 or just below 6, and the class width is 4 (5-1).

3. When calculating the midpoint of a class: A student might use the upper bound instead of the midpoint formula (midpoint = lower bound + (class width / 2)), leading to incorrect calculations."
561,Misinterprets the order of division in worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the order in which division operations should be performed in worded problems, often due to the way the problem is phrased or the order of the numbers presented. Students may incorrectly assume that the order of division is based on the order of the numbers given in the problem, rather than following the mathematical structure of the problem.

For example, in the following cases:

- Case 1: ""Tom has 18 cookies to share among 3 of his friends. If he gives them 2 cookies each, how many groups of 2 cookies can he make?"" Students may divide 18 by 2 first, then divide the result by 3, instead of dividing 18 by 3 to find out how many cookies each friend gets, and then dividing that result by 2.

- Case 2: ""A bookshelf has 24 books to be packed into boxes that hold 4 books each. If the books are to be distributed equally among 6 classrooms, how many boxes will each classroom get?"" Students may divide 24 by 6 first, then divide the result by 4, instead of dividing 24 by 4 to find out how many boxes are needed, and then dividing that result by 6.

- Case 3: ""A pizza has 16 slices to be shared among 4 people. If each person gets an equal number of slices and they want to put them in bags of 2 slices each, how many bags can each person make?"" Students may divide 16 by 2 first, then divide the result by 4, instead of dividing 16 by 4 to find out how many slices each person gets, and then dividing that result by 2."
562,"When drawing a histogram, believes you plot cumulative frequency on the vertical axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a histogram, which is a graphical representation of a distribution of data. They incorrectly believe that the vertical axis of a histogram represents the cumulative frequency, which is the total of a frequency and all frequencies so far in a data set. This misunderstanding may lead students to incorrectly plot the cumulative frequencies on the vertical axis instead of the actual frequencies.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to create a histogram from a frequency table and mistakenly use the cumulative frequencies from the table for the vertical axis.
- When comparing the shapes of two or more histograms, students incorrectly interpret the cumulative frequencies on the vertical axis as actual frequencies, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When analyzing a histogram to determine the mode or median of a data set, students mistakenly use the cumulative frequencies on the vertical axis, resulting in incorrect calculations.
- When students are given a set of data and are asked to create both a frequency table and a histogram, but incorrectly transfer the cumulative frequencies from the table to the histogram."
563,Counts the squares rather than the diagonals when reflecting in y=x or y=-x ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to reflect a shape or a point across the lines y=x or y=-x. Instead of correctly reflecting the points by swapping the x and y coordinates (for y=x) or swapping the x and y coordinates and changing the sign of one of them (for y=-x), students mistakenly count the number of squares the point is away from the line and try to replicate this distance on the other side. This results in an incorrect reflection, as the student is essentially counting the squares rather than considering the diagonal path the point would take when reflected across the line.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reflecting a point (3,4) across the line y=x, a student may incorrectly count 3 squares to the left and 4 squares up, instead of swapping the x and y coordinates to get (4,3).
- When reflecting a shape across the line y=-x, a student may try to replicate the shape's distance from the line by counting squares, rather than swapping the x and y coordinates and changing the sign of one of them.
- When reflecting a point across the line y=x and then reflecting the resulting point across the line y=-x, a student may become confused and start counting squares instead of applying the correct reflection rules."
564,Does not understand set notation for complement (eg. A'),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to grasp the concept of set notation for the complement of a set. In set theory, the complement of a set A, denoted as A', is the set of all elements that are not in A. However, students may find it difficult to understand that the complement of a set includes all elements in the universal set that are not in the original set. They may mistakenly think that the complement is simply the empty set or a subset of the original set.

This misconception can lead to errors when working with set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference. Students may incorrectly apply the notation, leading to incorrect results.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When finding the complement of a set within a universal set, students may forget to include all elements that are not in the original set.
Example: If set A = {1, 2, 3} within the universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, students may incorrectly think that A' = {}, rather than A' = {4, 5}.
2. When working with set operations, such as union and intersection, students may misapply the complement notation.
Example: If set A = {1, 2} and set B = {2, 3}, students may incorrectly think that (A ∪ B)' = A' ∪ B', rather than (A ∪ B)' = (A' ∩ B').
3. When solving problems involving set theory in real-world contexts, students may misunderstand the meaning of the complement notation.
Example: If a survey asks students about their favorite sports, and set A represents the students who like football, students may incorrectly think that A' represents the students who do not like any sports, rather than the students who do not like football."
565,Divides rather than multiplies ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they need to divide instead of multiply in certain mathematical operations. For example, when scaling up or down quantities, students might divide the quantities instead of multiplying them by the scale factor, leading to incorrect results.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Scaling recipes: When doubling or tripling a recipe, students might divide the ingredients instead of multiplying them, resulting in incorrect quantities.
2. Enlarging or reducing shapes: When enlarging or reducing shapes, students might divide the dimensions instead of multiplying them by the scale factor, leading to incorrect sizes.
3. Converting between units: When converting between units, such as from millimeters to centimeters, students might divide instead of multiplying by the conversion factor, resulting in incorrect measurements.
4. Solving proportion problems: When solving proportion problems, students might divide instead of multiplying the quantities, leading to incorrect solutions.
5. Calculating area or volume of scaled shapes: When calculating the area or volume of shapes that have been scaled up or down, students might divide instead of multiplying the dimensions, resulting in incorrect calculations."
566,Thinks the inverse of subtraction is division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the opposite operation of subtraction is division, rather than addition. In other words, they think that to ""undo"" subtraction, they need to divide, rather than add. This misconception can lead to errors in a variety of mathematical contexts, particularly when solving equations or inverse operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving simple equations, such as 5 - x = 3, a student with this misconception may try to solve for x by dividing, rather than adding.
- When working with word problems that involve ""taking away"" or ""finding the difference"", students may mistakenly use division to find the answer.
- When using inverse operations to solve problems, such as finding the missing number in a subtraction equation, students may incorrectly use division instead of addition.
- When solving multi-step problems that involve both addition and subtraction, students with this misconception may incorrectly use division to ""undo"" subtraction, leading to incorrect answers."
567,"When doing operations with decimals, ignores significant zeros after the decimal point","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the importance of significant zeros after the decimal point in decimal numbers. They may believe that these zeros can be omitted without changing the value of the number, which can lead to incorrect results when performing arithmetic operations with decimals.

For example, students may think that 2.0, 2.00, and 2 are all equal and can be used interchangeably, without realizing that the zeros after the decimal point provide crucial information about the precision of the measurement or calculation.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When adding or subtracting decimals, students may ignore the zeros after the decimal point, leading to incorrect alignment of the numbers and incorrect results.
- When multiplying or dividing decimals, students may omit the zeros after the decimal point, resulting in incorrect placement of the decimal point in the product or quotient.
- When comparing decimal numbers, students may overlook the zeros after the decimal point, leading to incorrect conclusions about which number is greater or smaller.
- When rounding decimal numbers, students may disregard the zeros after the decimal point, leading to incorrect rounding and loss of precision.
- When solving problems involving measurement or scientific notation, students may neglect the significant zeros after the decimal point, resulting in incorrect calculations and conclusions."
568,"When solving a problem that requires an inverse operation (e.g. missing number problems), does subtraction when division is required","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with a problem that involves finding a missing number, often in the context of inverse operations. In such cases, students tend to default to subtraction when the problem actually requires division. This may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between operations, specifically the inverse relationship between multiplication and division. As a result, students may incorrectly apply subtraction, which can lead to an incorrect solution.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A problem states that ""Tom has 18 pencils to put into bags of 3. How many bags can he make?"" and the student responds with 18 - 3 = 15, instead of 18 ÷ 3 = 6.
- A question asks ""A bookshelf has 24 books to be packed into boxes of 4 books each. How many boxes are needed?"" and the student answers with 24 - 4 = 20, instead of 24 ÷ 4 = 6.
- A scenario presents ""A bakery has 48 cupcakes to be packed into boxes of 6 cupcakes each. How many boxes are needed?"" and the student responds with 48 - 6 = 42, instead of 48 ÷ 6 = 8."
569,Believes the solutions to an equation have opposite signs from its x intercepts,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the signs of the solutions to an equation are opposite to the signs of its x-intercepts on the graph. They may think that if an x-intercept is positive, the corresponding solution must be negative, and vice versa. This misunderstanding can be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the x-intercepts and the solutions of an equation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing a quadratic equation and finding its x-intercepts, a student may incorrectly assume that the signs of the solutions are opposite to the signs of the x-intercepts.
- When solving a linear equation and graphing it on a coordinate plane, a student may mistakenly believe that the x-intercept's sign determines the sign of the solution.
- When working with polynomial equations with multiple x-intercepts, a student may incorrectly apply the misconception to each x-intercept, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When using technology, such as graphing calculators, to find x-intercepts and solutions, a student may misinterpret the output and apply the misconception."
570,Does not understand that all angles and sides must be equal for regular shapes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a shape is regular as long as it has some equal sides or angles, but not necessarily all of them. They may think that if a shape has two or three equal sides, it is enough to classify it as a regular shape. Similarly, they may assume that if a shape has two or three equal angles, it is a regular shape. This misunderstanding shows that students have not fully grasped the definition of regular shapes, which requires all sides and angles to be equal.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying regular polygons, such as equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons, students may incorrectly classify shapes with only some equal sides or angles as regular.
- When comparing and contrasting different shapes, students may not recognize the importance of all sides and angles being equal in order to classify a shape as regular.
- When creating or drawing shapes, students may produce shapes that they believe are regular but actually have unequal sides or angles.
- When solving problems involving symmetry or tessellations, students may not understand why certain shapes cannot be used to create symmetrical patterns or tessellations due to their unequal sides or angles."
571,Believes a smaller number of shaded parts represents a smaller fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to compare fractions represented visually, often with shaded parts of a shape. They mistakenly believe that the fraction with the smaller number of shaded parts is the smaller fraction, without considering the total number of parts or the size of the parts. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the importance of considering both the numerator and the denominator when comparing fractions.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Comparing 1/4 and 2/8, where students might think 1/4 is smaller because it has fewer shaded parts, even though they represent the same value.
- Comparing 2/6 and 3/9, where students might think 2/6 is smaller because it has fewer shaded parts, without realizing that both fractions represent the same proportion.
- Comparing fractions with different denominators, such as 1/2 and 2/4, where students might think 1/2 is smaller because it has fewer shaded parts, without recognizing that they are equivalent fractions."
572,Writes repeated letters instead of using index form of a variable,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are introduced to algebra and are required to represent repeated variables. Instead of using the index form (e.g., x^2, y^3), they write the variable repeatedly (e.g., xx, yyy). This indicates a lack of understanding of the concept of indices and how they are used to simplify expressions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When expanding or simplifying algebraic expressions, such as writing xx instead of x^2 in the expression 2xx + 3.
- When solving equations with repeated variables, such as writing yyyy instead of y^4 in the equation 4yyyy = 256.
- When representing geometric shapes algebraically, such as writing xxx instead of x^3 to represent the volume of a cube."
573,Thinks numbers are divisible by all multiples of their factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of factors and divisibility. They may believe that if a number has a certain factor, it must also be divisible by all multiples of that factor. For instance, if 12 is divisible by 3, they may think it is also divisible by 6, 9, 12, etc., just because these numbers are multiples of 3. They fail to recognize that a number is only divisible by its actual factors, not by all multiples of those factors.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A student is given the number 24 and is asked to list all numbers it is divisible by. They may incorrectly include 18 (which is a multiple of 3 and 6, both factors of 24, but not a factor itself).
- When asked to simplify a fraction, a student may reduce it incorrectly by canceling out a number that is a multiple of a common factor but not an actual common factor.
- In solving problems involving least common multiples (LCM), students may incorrectly assume that the LCM of two numbers must include all multiples of their factors."
574,Thinks there are 100mm in a km,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty converting between different units of measurement, particularly between millimeters (mm) and kilometers (km). They may mistakenly believe that there are 100 millimeters in a kilometer due to a lack of understanding of the correct conversion factors between units. This error can stem from a misunderstanding of the metric system, where students might confuse the number of units in a conversion or overlook the actual conversion rates (1 km = 1,000,000 mm or 1,000 m). As a result, they may arrive at incorrect calculations or estimates when dealing with measurement problems involving different units.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When calculating the distance between two cities, a student might convert kilometers to millimeters and think that 1 km is equal to 100 mm.
- When solving a problem that requires converting measurements from one unit to another, a student might mistakenly write that 1 km = 100 mm, leading to incorrect results.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring the length of a road or the height of a building, a student with this misconception may provide incorrect measurements or estimates due to their misunderstanding of unit conversions."
575,Thinks that when you put an input into a function machine you apply the inverse operation rather than the operation given.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of function machines or input-output relationships in algebra. They mistakenly believe that when a value is input into a function machine, the inverse operation of the given function is applied to the input, rather than the actual operation.

For example, if a function machine has the rule ""add 3"" and the input is 5, a student with this misconception might think the output is 2 (i.e., 5 - 3), instead of the correct output, which is 8 (i.e., 5 + 3).

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A function machine with the rule ""multiply by 2"" and an input of 4: a student with this misconception might think the output is 2 (i.e., 4 ÷ 2), instead of 8 (i.e., 4 × 2).
2. A function machine with the rule ""subtract 2"" and an input of 7: a student with this misconception might think the output is 9 (i.e., 7 + 2), instead of 5 (i.e., 7 - 2).
3. A function machine with the rule ""divide by 4"" and an input of 12: a student with this misconception might think the output is 48 (i.e., 12 × 4), instead of 3 (i.e., 12 ÷ 4)."
576,Cannot identify a line of symmetry in a simple shape,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to recognize a line that divides a shape into two identical parts, often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of symmetry or an inability to visualize the shape being divided. Students may mistakenly identify a line of symmetry that doesn't actually divide the shape into two identical parts, or they may not be able to identify any line of symmetry at all.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is given a shape with multiple lines of symmetry and they identify only one or none at all. For example, a square has multiple lines of symmetry, but a student may only identify the line that divides it horizontally.
- When a student is given a shape that is not symmetrical, but they try to force a line of symmetry onto it. For example, a scalene triangle does not have a line of symmetry, but a student may incorrectly identify a line that they think divides the shape into two identical parts.
- When a student is given a shape with a curved line of symmetry, such as a circle or a semicircle. In this case, a student may struggle to identify the line of symmetry because it is not a straight line.
- When a student is given a 3D shape and asked to identify its lines of symmetry. This can be more challenging than identifying lines of symmetry in 2D shapes, as students need to consider the shape from multiple angles."
577,Does not realise multiplying a variable by itself results in a power of that variable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that when a variable is multiplied by itself, the result is a power of that variable, denoted by an exponent. For instance, the expression ""x * x"" is equivalent to ""x^2"". This misconception can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of exponents or a failure to connect the idea of repeated multiplication with the notation of powers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When expanding algebraic expressions, such as (x + 2)(x + 3), where students may write x * x as 'xx' instead of x^2.
- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as x * x * x, where students may not recognize that this can be written as x^3.
- When solving equations with powers, such as x^2 = 4, where students may not realize that x * x = 4 is equivalent to x^2 = 4.
- When working with formulas, such as the area of a circle (A = πr^2), where students may not understand that r * r is equivalent to r^2."
578,Does not recognise when a surd can be simplified,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to identify that a surd can be simplified further by finding a perfect square factor. Students may believe that a surd is already in its simplest form when it is not, or they may not recognize that certain surds can be expressed as a product of a perfect square and another surd, which would allow for simplification.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with surds in the form of √(ab), where a is a perfect square and b is not, students may not recognize that the surd can be simplified as √a * √b.
- When simplifying surds with large numbers, students may overlook the fact that a perfect square factor can be extracted, leading to a simpler form of the surd.
- When working with more complex expressions involving surds, such as fractions or equations, students may not realize that simplifying the surd is a necessary step to solve the problem.
- When comparing the magnitude of different surds, students may not recognize that simplifying the surds is necessary to make a valid comparison.
- When dealing with trigonometric expressions involving surds, students may not recognize that simplifying the surd can lead to a more manageable expression."
579,Thinks you cannot multiply by a decimal to get equivalent fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that equivalent fractions can only be obtained by multiplying the numerator and denominator by whole numbers, and not by decimals. They may think that multiplying by a decimal would change the value of the fraction, rather than just its form. For example, when trying to find an equivalent fraction for 1/2, they may believe that multiplying both the numerator and denominator by 0.5 is not a valid operation.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying fractions with decimal equivalents, e.g., 3/6 = 0.5, and trying to multiply the fraction by 0.5 to get an equivalent fraction.
- When comparing fractions and trying to find a common denominator that is a decimal.
- When converting between fractions and decimals, and incorrectly assuming that multiplying by a decimal changes the value of the original fraction.
- When solving proportion problems involving fractions and decimals, and not recognizing that multiplying by a decimal can be a valid way to find an equivalent fraction."
580,Does not understand use of the counters to represent algebra,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to visualize and apply the concept of counters or blocks to represent unknown values or variables in algebra. They may have difficulty understanding that counters can be used to symbolize the unknown quantity in an equation, making it challenging for them to set up and solve simple equations.

For instance, when using counters to represent the equation 2x + 3 = 7, students with this misconception may not comprehend that the counters are not just physical objects but also represent the variable 'x'. They may fail to grasp that the number of counters can change depending on the value of 'x'.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When introducing the concept of simple equations, such as x + 2 = 5, and using counters to represent the variable 'x'.
- When using counters to demonstrate the concept of balancing equations, such as 2x = 6, and students struggle to visualize the relationship between the counters and the variable.
- When solving word problems, such as ""Tom has 5 more pencils than Sarah, and together they have 11 pencils. How many pencils does Sarah have?"" and students are asked to represent the problem using counters and algebraic equations."
581,Writes times in the afternoon as if they are morning on a 24 hour clock,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully familiar with the 24-hour clock system. In a 24-hour clock, the day starts at 00:00 (midnight) and ends at 23:59. However, some students may incorrectly assume that times in the afternoon (after 12:00 PM) are written in the same way as morning times, without accounting for the 12-hour shift. 

For example, they may write 2:00 PM as 02:00 instead of the correct 14:00, or 3:45 PM as 03:45 instead of 15:45. This misconception can lead to confusion when dealing with time-related problems, especially when calculating time intervals or schedules.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Writing 1:00 PM as 01:00 instead of 13:00
- Writing 5:30 PM as 05:30 instead of 17:30
- Writing 12:00 PM (noon) as 12:00 instead of 12:00 (although this is technically correct, it may indicate a lack of understanding of the 24-hour clock system)"
582,Confuses the dependent and independent variables on the axes of a line graph,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly identify or plot the dependent variable (the variable being measured or observed) and the independent variable (the variable being manipulated or changed) on the x and y axes of a line graph. Typically, the independent variable should be plotted on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis. However, students with this misconception may swap these or choose the wrong axis for each variable, leading to incorrect interpretation of the graph.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When analyzing the relationship between the amount of water added to a plant and its growth, a student might plot the growth (dependent variable) on the x-axis and the amount of water (independent variable) on the y-axis.
- Case 2: In an experiment measuring the effect of temperature on the melting rate of ice, a student may incorrectly plot the melting rate (dependent variable) on the x-axis and the temperature (independent variable) on the y-axis.
- Case 3: When graphing the relationship between study time and test scores, a student might mistakenly put study time (independent variable) on the y-axis and test scores (dependent variable) on the x-axis."
583,Ignores negative sign when expanding bracket,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard the negative sign in front of a bracket when expanding it. They may incorrectly apply the distributive property, forgetting to multiply each term inside the bracket by the negative sign outside. As a result, they may obtain an incorrect expanded expression with incorrect signs for some or all of the terms.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Expanding a single bracket: For example, expanding -(2x + 3) where students might write 2x + 3 instead of -2x - 3.
- Expanding the difference of two brackets: For example, expanding (x + 2) - (x - 3) where students might incorrectly combine like terms due to ignoring the negative sign.
- Expanding a bracket with multiple terms: For example, expanding -(x^2 + 2x - 1) where students might write x^2 + 2x - 1 instead of -x^2 - 2x + 1."
584,Underestimates the area of shapes when counting squares when some squares are neither wholes nor halves,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a shape by counting squares, but some parts of the shape do not fit perfectly into whole or half squares. Students with this misconception tend to ignore or underestimate the areas of these partial squares, leading to an inaccurate calculation of the total area. They might only count whole and half squares, neglecting the additional area contributed by the fractional parts of squares.

This misconception can arise in various situations, such as:

- When dealing with complex shapes that have many irregularities, making it difficult for students to accurately estimate the area.
- When working with shapes that have curved or diagonal edges, resulting in partial squares that are not easily quantifiable.
- When the grid used to measure the area is too coarse, leading to a larger proportion of partial squares that are difficult to estimate.
- When students are not familiar with estimating or calculating the areas of fractional parts of squares, leading them to ignore these areas altogether.
- When students are working with real-world applications, such as measuring the area of a room or a piece of land, where the shapes involved may not fit perfectly into a grid."
585,Believes lines can be parallel by having the same y intercept OR gradient,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the conditions for two lines to be parallel. They believe that lines can be parallel if they either have the same y-intercept or the same gradient. However, this is not the case, as having the same y-intercept only means that the lines intersect at the same point on the y-axis, and it does not necessarily mean they are parallel.

On the other hand, having the same gradient is a necessary condition for lines to be parallel, but students with this misconception also incorrectly assume that having the same y-intercept is a sufficient condition for lines to be parallel. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the gradient and the y-intercept of a line.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When graphing two lines with the same y-intercept but different gradients, students may incorrectly label them as parallel.
- When solving a problem that requires finding the equation of a line parallel to a given line, students may focus on matching the y-intercept rather than the gradient.
- When asked to determine if two lines are parallel based on their equations, students may check if the y-intercepts are the same, rather than comparing the gradients."
586,Mixes up square numbers and prime numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the definitions and properties of square numbers and prime numbers. Square numbers are the numbers obtained by squaring integers (e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16), while prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7). Students may mistakenly identify square numbers as prime numbers or vice versa, due to a lack of understanding of the distinct characteristics of each type of number.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Identifying the square number 9 as a prime number because it is not divisible by 2, 3, 4, or 5, except for the fact that 9 is divisible by 3.
- Thinking that the prime number 7 is a square number because it is a ""special"" number.
- Listing the number 1 as a prime number, as it can be divided by 1, and 1 is also a square number.
- Confusing the square number 4 with a prime number, since 4 has only 3 factors (1, 2, and 4), and this may seem like a small enough number of factors for 4 to be prime.
- Incorrectly assuming that the square of a prime number is also prime. For example, 3 is a prime number, but 3^2 = 9 is not prime.
- Making incorrect assumptions about the distribution of prime numbers among the square numbers, such as assuming that every other square number is prime."
587,"Thinks that when adding decimals with a different number of decimal places, you should line up the digits to the right ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding decimals with a different number of decimal places. They mistakenly believe that they should line up the digits to the right, rather than aligning the decimal points. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the place value of the digits in the decimals.

For example, when adding 3.5 and 2.25, a student with this misconception may line up the digits to the right like this:

3.5
2.25
------
 Resulting in an incorrect calculation.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Adding 2.1 and 1.25
- Adding 5.3 and 2.725
- Adding 1.9 and 3.075

In each of these cases, the student may incorrectly line up the digits to the right, rather than aligning the decimal points, leading to incorrect results."
588,Thinks 10l = 1 cubic metre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that 10 liters is equivalent to 1 cubic meter, likely due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between units of volume. A cubic meter is a unit of volume in the metric system, and it is equal to 1,000 liters. However, students may mistakenly think that 10 liters, which is a common volume for everyday objects like water bottles, is the same as 1 cubic meter. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conversions when working with different units of volume.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to convert 10 liters of water to cubic meters, a student may answer 1 cubic meter.
- When comparing the volume of a container that holds 10 liters to a container that holds 1 cubic meter, a student may think they are the same size.
- When solving a problem that requires converting a volume from liters to cubic meters, a student may divide or multiply by the wrong conversion factor, resulting in an incorrect answer."
589,Believes extreme values can affect the median,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that extreme values, also known as outliers, can significantly affect the median of a dataset. They may think that because extreme values can greatly affect the mean, the same must be true for the median. However, this is not the case. Students with this misconception may struggle to understand the resistance of the median to outliers and how it is calculated based on the middle values of a dataset.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is analyzing a dataset of exam scores and notices an unusually high or low score. They might think that this outlier will greatly affect the median score.
- Case 2: When working with a dataset of city temperatures, a student comes across an abnormally hot or cold day and assumes that this extreme value will significantly impact the median temperature.
- Case 3: In a set of athlete performance times, a student sees a record-breaking time that is much faster than the rest and mistakenly believes it will greatly affect the median time."
590,Has used slant height and base to find area of a triangle rather than perpendicular height and base,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly use the slant height of a triangle instead of the perpendicular height to calculate its area. The slant height is the distance from the vertex of a triangle to the opposite side, measured along a line that is not necessarily perpendicular to the base. On the other hand, the perpendicular height, also known as the altitude, is the distance from the vertex of a triangle to the opposite side, measured along a line that is perpendicular to the base.

Students may use the slant height because it is often more easily visible or measurable in diagrams or real-life situations, whereas the perpendicular height might require more effort to determine. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations of the area of a triangle, as the formula for the area of a triangle (Area = 0.5 * base * height) specifically requires the use of the perpendicular height.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the area of a triangle in a trapezoid or other complex shapes where the slant height is more apparent.
- Calculating the area of a right-angled triangle where the slant height is equal to the hypotenuse, and students mistakenly use this length instead of the actual height.
- Determining the area of a triangle in real-world applications, such as calculating the area of a roof or a slope, where the slant height is more easily measurable."
591,Does not believe the length of a diagonal line can be worked out based on horizontal and vertical measurements,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the relationship between the horizontal and vertical measurements of a shape and the length of its diagonal. They may believe that the diagonal is an unrelated length that cannot be determined using the given measurements. This may be due to a lack of understanding of geometric concepts such as Pythagoras' theorem, which provides a mathematical relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When students are asked to find the length of the diagonal of a rectangle given its length and width.
* When students are tasked with calculating the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the lengths of the other two sides.
* When students are required to apply geometric concepts to real-world problems, such as determining the distance between two points on a map or the length of a shadow.
* When students are introduced to more complex geometric shapes, such as quadrilaterals or polygons, and need to find the length of diagonals or other line segments.
* When students are solving problems involving the construction of shapes, such as building design or engineering, and need to calculate the length of diagonals or other structural elements."
592,Thinks a fractional scale factor changes direction as well as size,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a fractional scale factor not only changes the size of a shape but also flips or changes its direction. They might think that scaling a shape by a fraction (e.g., 1/2) will not only reduce its size but also reflect or rotate it. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect transformations and a lack of understanding of the true effect of scale factors on shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to scale a shape by a fractional factor, they might draw the shape on the opposite side of the center of enlargement, thinking that the fraction changes the direction.
- When solving problems involving similar figures, students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that a fractional scale factor changes the orientation of the figures, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.
- In real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, students may misinterpret the effect of a fractional scale factor on a design, resulting in incorrect models or blueprints.
- When working with geometric transformations, students may confuse the effect of a fractional scale factor with that of a reflection or rotation, leading to incorrect compositions of transformations."
593,Thinks multiplying by a variable is the same as raising to the power of that variable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplication and exponentiation in algebra. They incorrectly assume that multiplying a number or expression by a variable (e.g., 2x) is equivalent to raising that number or expression to the power of the variable (e.g., 2^x). This misconception can lead to incorrect simplification and manipulation of algebraic expressions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When simplifying expressions like 2x, students may think it is equal to 2^x.
* When solving equations like 3x = 12, students may attempt to solve it as 3^x = 12.
* When working with algebraic expressions like x(2x), students may incorrectly simplify it as x^(2x) instead of 2x^2.
* When dealing with functions like f(x) = 2x, students may mistakenly interpret it as f(x) = 2^x.
* When differentiating between exponential and linear growth, students may incorrectly apply the concept of multiplication instead of exponentiation."
594,Believes y=-f(x) is a reflection in the y-axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the negative sign in front of the function, y = -f(x), indicates a reflection across the y-axis. However, the negative sign actually signifies a reflection across the x-axis. This error is often due to a lack of understanding of the effect of the negative sign on the function's graph. Students may think that since a negative sign is involved, the reflection must be across the y-axis, rather than realizing that it flips the graph upside down.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Graphing simple functions: When asked to graph y = -x^2, a student with this misconception may draw the graph reflected across the y-axis, rather than the x-axis.
2. Transforming functions: If given the function y = sin(x) and asked to graph y = -sin(x), the student may incorrectly reflect the original graph across the y-axis.
3. Analyzing function properties: When determining the properties of the function y = -2x, a student with this misconception may conclude that the graph is a reflection of y = 2x across the y-axis, rather than the x-axis."
595,Believes the adjacent side is where the opposite side is in a right angled triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle. In a right-angled triangle, the adjacent side is the side next to the given angle, not including the hypotenuse. However, students with this misconception believe the adjacent side is the side opposite to the given angle. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions in trigonometric problems, particularly when using trigonometric ratios such as sine, cosine, and tangent.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When finding the cosine of an angle in a right triangle, a student may use the length of the opposite side instead of the adjacent side.
2. When identifying the adjacent side in a diagram, a student may point to the side opposite the given angle instead of the side next to it.
3. When solving a problem involving the tangent of an angle, a student may incorrectly use the length of the opposite side as the adjacent side, leading to an incorrect answer.
4. In a word problem involving right triangles, such as calculating the height of a building, a student may misidentify the adjacent side, leading to an incorrect calculation."
596,Chosen the longest value rather than the greatest,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are comparing numbers, particularly decimals or fractions, and mistakenly believe that the number with the most digits or the longest value is the greatest, rather than comparing the actual values. This shows a lack of understanding of place value and the concept of magnitude.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing decimals: Students may think that 0.123 is greater than 0.12 because 0.123 has more digits, rather than understanding that the extra digit in the hundredths place makes it a smaller value.
- Comparing fractions: Students may think that 1/8 is greater than 1/4 because the denominator 8 is greater than the denominator 4, rather than understanding that the fraction with the smaller denominator is actually greater.
- Comparing mixed numbers: Students may think that 2 1/8 is greater than 2 1/4 because the fraction 1/8 has more digits than 1/4, rather than understanding that the fraction with the smaller denominator is actually greater."
597,Thinks that to decrease by a percentage you just multiply by the decimal equivalent to that percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with finding a percentage of a number by multiplying it by the decimal equivalent, but they incorrectly apply this concept when decreasing a number by a certain percentage. They mistakenly believe that to decrease a number by, say, 20%, they simply multiply it by 0.20. This misunderstanding stems from a lack of understanding of the concept of percentage decrease, which involves subtracting the percentage of the original value from the original value itself.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of $80. A student might think they can find the sale price by multiplying $80 by 0.15.
- A store has a 25% discount on all electronics. A student might calculate the discount price of a $100 TV by multiplying $100 by 0.25.
- A bakery has a 10% discount on all cakes. A student might think they can find the discounted price of a $50 cake by multiplying $50 by 0.10."
598,"When subtracting a surd from an integer, just divides the integer by the number under the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with subtraction operations involving surds (also known as radicals) and integers. They may think that subtracting a surd from an integer is equivalent to dividing the integer by the number under the surd. For example, when given the expression 5 - √3, students with this misconception might simplify it as 5 ÷ 3, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1.67.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* Case 1: 8 - √2, where students may calculate it as 8 ÷ 2, resulting in an incorrect answer of 4.
* Case 2: 12 - √4, where students may calculate it as 12 ÷ 4, resulting in an incorrect answer of 3.
* Case 3: 9 - √5, where students may calculate it as 9 ÷ 5, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1.8.

This misconception highlights the need for students to understand the properties and rules of surds and to develop a solid foundation in mathematical operations involving these concepts."
599,Does not understand that an obtuse angle is between 90 and 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the definition of an obtuse angle. They may believe that an obtuse angle is any angle greater than 90 degrees, including those greater than 180 degrees, or they may think that an obtuse angle is any ""big"" angle without a clear understanding of its range. As a result, students with this misconception may struggle to identify or classify angles as obtuse, and may also have difficulty understanding properties and relationships between angles.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify whether a 200-degree angle is obtuse, the student may say ""yes"" because they believe an obtuse angle is any angle greater than 90 degrees.
- When asked to draw an obtuse angle, the student may draw a 250-degree angle, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the 90-180 degree range.
- When given a problem that involves determining the type of angle (acute, right, obtuse, straight) in a geometric shape, the student may incorrectly classify a 220-degree angle as obtuse.
- When asked to explain the difference between an obtuse and a straight angle, the student may provide a vague or inaccurate response, revealing their misunderstanding of the obtuse angle's definition."
600,Thinks a horizontal line on a distance time graph means a distance of 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly interpret a horizontal line on a distance-time graph as indicating a distance of 0, rather than understanding that it represents a constant distance over time, where the object is not moving (i.e., at rest) or moving at the same position. They fail to recognize that the horizontal line signifies that the distance remains the same, not that it is zero.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When analyzing a distance-time graph of an object at rest, where the student thinks the horizontal line means the object has traveled 0 distance.
- When comparing distance-time graphs of different objects, where the student incorrectly concludes that an object with a horizontal line has not moved at all.
- When interpreting real-world scenarios, such as a person waiting at a bus stop (where their distance from the starting point remains constant), and the student mistakenly thinks the person has not traveled any distance.
- When solving problems involving distance-time graphs, where the student incorrectly calculates the total distance traveled by an object with a horizontal line on its graph."
601,Believes a less steep gradient corresponds to a faster speed,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the steepness of a line graph, particularly in the context of distance-time or speed-time graphs. They mistakenly believe that a less steep gradient indicates a faster speed, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between the variables being represented.

In the case of a distance-time graph, students with this misconception may think that a line with a shallower slope represents an object moving at a greater speed. However, the steepness of the line actually represents the rate of change of distance with respect to time, where a steeper slope indicates a faster speed.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* Case 1: Interpreting the speed of an object on a distance-time graph. A student might look at two lines on the graph, one steeper than the other, and incorrectly conclude that the line with the shallower slope represents the faster-moving object.
* Case 2: Analyzing the motion of two objects on a speed-time graph. A student with this misconception might mistakenly believe that the object with the less steep gradient is accelerating more quickly than the object with the steeper gradient.
* Case 3: Comparing the speeds of different athletes or vehicles on a graph. A student might incorrectly assume that the athlete or vehicle represented by the line with the shallower slope is moving at a faster pace."
602,"Thinks multiplying two or more negative numbers together always gives a positive answer, regardless of how many negative numbers there are in the sum","Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rule that multiplying two negative numbers gives a positive result. They may have learned that, for example, (-2) × (-3) = 6, and incorrectly assume that this rule applies to any multiplication involving multiple negative numbers. They might think that as long as there are at least two negative numbers being multiplied, the result will always be positive.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* Multiplying three negative numbers together: A student might think that (-2) × (-3) × (-4) equals a positive number, simply because there are multiple negative numbers involved.
* Multiplying four or more negative numbers together: Similarly, a student might assume that (-2) × (-3) × (-4) × (-5) is positive, without considering the actual rules of multiplying negative numbers.
* Simplifying expressions involving multiple negative numbers: When faced with an expression like (-2) × (-3) × (-4) × 5, a student with this misconception might incorrectly assume that the result is positive, without properly evaluating the expression.
* Solving problems involving negative numbers in real-world contexts: In problems involving temperatures, finances, or other real-world applications, students with this misconception might make errors when calculating the product of multiple negative numbers, leading to incorrect conclusions."
603,Believes you can make assumptions about size of pie chart sectors without enough information,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can accurately determine or compare the size of sectors in a pie chart without having sufficient information about the data being represented. They may think that by simply looking at the pie chart, they can make assumptions about the proportions or percentages of the different sectors, even if the actual data values are not provided or are incomplete.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing two pie charts with similar-looking sectors, students may assume the sectors represent the same proportion or percentage without checking the actual data.
- When a pie chart has unlabeled or missing sectors, students may make assumptions about the size of the unknown sectors based on the appearance of the chart.
- When a pie chart has a misleading or unclear scale, students may misinterpret the size of the sectors and make incorrect assumptions about the data.
- When students are given a partial pie chart and are asked to complete it or make predictions about the missing sectors, they may rely on visual assumptions rather than mathematical calculations."
604,Gives probability as an integer instead of a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring, and it is usually expressed as a fraction between 0 and 1. They tend to provide the number of favorable outcomes or the number of total outcomes as an integer, rather than dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes to obtain a fraction. This misconception shows a lack of comprehension of the fundamental concept of probability as a ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the probability of getting a certain number on a die roll, they may simply answer ""1"" if there is one favorable outcome, instead of 1/6.
- When students are asked to find the probability of drawing a specific card from a deck, they may answer ""4"" if there are four favorable outcomes (e.g., four aces), instead of 4/52.
- When students are asked to find the probability of an event in a real-life scenario, such as the probability of it raining on a given day, they may answer ""50"" if they think it is a 50-50 chance, instead of 1/2."
605,Believes the sin graph relates to the tan function,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly associate the sine (sin) graph with the tangent (tan) function, possibly due to the fact that both functions are used in trigonometry and are related to the unit circle. They may think that the shapes of the graphs are similar or that the equations for sin and tan are equivalent, leading to incorrect assumptions about their relationships.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When graphing trigonometric functions, a student may incorrectly label the sin graph as the tan graph, or vice versa.
2. When solving problems involving right triangles, a student may mistakenly substitute the sin function for the tan function, leading to incorrect calculations.
3. When analyzing periodic phenomena, such as sound waves or light waves, a student may incorrectly assume that the sin graph represents the tan function, leading to misunderstandings about the wave's behavior.
4. When working with trigonometric identities, a student may incorrectly simplify expressions involving sin and tan, due to their misconceived relationship.
5. When solving problems involving circular motion, a student may mistakenly apply the sin function to a situation that actually requires the tan function, leading to incorrect results."
606,Does not understand how to simplify fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to grasp the concept of simplifying fractions to their lowest terms. They may believe that simplifying a fraction involves changing its value or that it is not necessary to simplify fractions. This can lead to difficulties in comparing, adding, and subtracting fractions. Students may also incorrectly simplify fractions, such as dividing or multiplying the numerator and denominator by different numbers, resulting in an incorrect simplified fraction.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to simplify the fraction 6/8, a student may incorrectly simplify it to 2/4 or 3/4, instead of 3/4.
- When comparing the fractions 1/2 and 2/4, a student may not recognize that they are equal and can be simplified to 1/2.
- When adding the fractions 1/4 and 1/4, a student may not simplify the answer to 1/2, instead leaving it as 2/4.
- When asked to simplify the fraction 9/12, a student may not recognize that both numbers can be divided by 3, resulting in the simplified fraction 3/4."
607,Thinks the area of a sector is theta/360 x r x pi (forgetting the radius is squared),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students recall the formula for the area of a sector but incorrectly simplify it, forgetting that the radius term should be squared. The students understand that the area of a sector is proportional to the angle and the area of the whole circle but incorrectly apply the formula. They mistakenly multiply the angle fraction (theta/360) by the radius (r) and pi, rather than multiplying it by the area of the circle (pi * r^2).

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the area of a sector given the radius and angle, and they plug the values into the incorrect formula.
- When comparing the areas of sectors with different radii, students might incorrectly assume that the relationship between the areas is linear, rather than quadratic.
- When solving problems that involve finding the angle of a sector given its area and radius, students with this misconception will arrive at incorrect solutions."
608,Believes an upward line has a negative gradient,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient in a line graph. They may think that an upward line, which indicates an increase in the y-value as the x-value increases, has a negative gradient. However, this is not the case. The students might be confusing the direction of the line with the sign of the gradient, or they might have a misunderstanding of the relationship between the x and y axes. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When analyzing a line graph in Data and Statistics, where students might interpret an upward trend as having a negative gradient.
- When working with linear equations in Algebra, where students may incorrectly assign a negative coefficient to the x-term, thinking that an upward line has a negative gradient.
- When solving problems involving the slope of a line in Geometry and Measure, where students may mistakenly calculate the gradient as negative for an upward line."
609,"when dividing a fraction by an integer, multiplies the numerator by the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer. They mistakenly believe that to divide a fraction by an integer, they need to multiply the numerator of the fraction by that integer, while leaving the denominator unchanged. For example, if the problem is 1/2 ÷ 3, students with this misconception would multiply the numerator (1) by 3, resulting in 3/2. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Dividing a fraction by a whole number in a word problem, e.g., ""Tom has 1/4 of a pizza, and he wants to share it equally among 2 friends.""
- Simplifying a division problem involving fractions in algebra, e.g., (2/3) ÷ 4.
- Solving a problem involving ratios and proportions, e.g., scaling down a recipe that involves fractional ingredients by a certain factor."
610,Does not recognise how to write a list of prime factors from a factor tree,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to accurately extract the prime factors from a factor tree, which is a diagrammatic representation of the factors of a number. Students may struggle to identify the prime numbers within the factor tree, or they may incorrectly include composite numbers or duplicate factors in their list of prime factors.

For example, when given the number 24 and its factor tree:

24 → 4 x 6
4 → 2 x 2
6 → 2 x 3

Students with this misconception may:

* List the factors as 4, 6, 2, and 3, without recognizing that 4 and 6 are not prime numbers.
* Write the list of prime factors as 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, without combining the repeated prime factors (e.g., 2^3).
* Include unnecessary or incorrect information, such as listing 1 as a prime factor or including composite numbers like 4 or 6 in the list of prime factors.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When finding the prime factorization of a number to simplify fractions or algebraic expressions.
* When solving problems involving the least common multiple (LCM) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers.
* When working with exponents and powers of prime numbers in algebraic expressions."
611,"When two digits sum to 10 or more during addition of decimals, does not carry across decimal point to preceding digit.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding decimals and the sum of two digits in the same place value position is 10 or more. Students with this misconception believe that the ""carry"" only applies to whole number addition and not to decimal addition. They may incorrectly assume that the digits after the decimal point are separate entities and do not affect the preceding digits.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding 4.5 and 6.7, students may write 10.2 as 10.12, failing to carry the 1 to the preceding digit.
- When adding 3.9 and 4.8, students may write 7.17 as 8.7, failing to carry the 1 to the preceding digit.
- When adding 2.5 and 9.8, students may write 11.3 as 12.3, failing to carry the 1 to the preceding digit.

In each of these cases, students are not recognizing the need to carry the extra digit across the decimal point to the preceding digit."
612,"Believes that when a shape is enlarged, the area rather than the scale factor is squared","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between scale factor and area when a shape is enlarged. They may believe that if a shape is enlarged by a scale factor of 'n', the area of the enlarged shape is 'n' squared times the area of the original shape, but incorrectly think that the scale factor itself is squared, rather than the area being affected by the square of the scale factor.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is given a square with side length 5cm and is asked to find the area of a similar square enlarged by a scale factor of 3. They may think that the scale factor is squared (i.e., 3^2 = 9) and apply this to the side length, rather than correctly squaring the scale factor's effect on the area.
2. When solving a problem involving the area of similar rectangles, a student might multiply the scale factor by itself and then multiply the original area by this squared value, but incorrectly state that the scale factor itself is squared.
3. In a real-world scenario, a student might be asked to calculate the area of a photograph enlarged by a certain scale factor. They may apply the misconception and square the scale factor, leading to an incorrect calculation of the enlarged area."
613,Thinks 0.3 = 1/3,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the decimal representation of a fraction is the same as its simplified fractional form. In this case, they assume that 0.3 is equivalent to 1/3 because they may have seen instances where a fraction with a denominator of 10 (e.g., 3/10) can be represented as a decimal by simply writing the numerator as the decimal (e.g., 0.3). However, they fail to understand that the actual decimal representation of 1/3 is a recurring decimal, which is 0.333... .

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When converting fractions to decimals, students might write 1/3 as 0.3 instead of 0.333...
* When comparing fractions and decimals, students might incorrectly compare 0.3 and 1/3, assuming they are equal.
* When performing calculations involving fractions and decimals, students might substitute 0.3 for 1/3, leading to incorrect results.
* When solving problems involving equivalent ratios or proportions, students might use 0.3 instead of 1/3, which can affect the accuracy of their answers."
614,"When solving simultaneous equations, thinks you only transform the term that is being eliminated, rather than the whole equation.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the method of elimination for solving simultaneous equations. They understand that the goal is to eliminate one variable by making the coefficients of that variable the same in both equations, but they mistakenly believe that only the term containing the variable to be eliminated needs to be transformed. They fail to recognize that any operation applied to one side of an equation must also be applied to the other side to maintain equality.

For example, consider the simultaneous equations:

2x + 3y = 7
x + 2y = 4

When trying to eliminate 'x', a student with this misconception might multiply the 'x' term in the second equation by 2, but not the rest of the equation, resulting in:

2x + 3y = 7
2x + 2y = 8 (instead of the correct 2x + 4y = 8)

Similarly, this misconception may also occur when trying to eliminate 'y'. For instance, if the equations are:

x + 2y = 5
3x + y = 6

A student might multiply the 'y' term in the first equation by 3, but not the 'x' term, resulting in:

x + 6y = 15 (instead of the correct 3x + 6y = 15)
3x + y = 6"
615,Adds rather than subtracts when using Pythagoras to find a shorter side,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of one of the shorter sides (legs) of a right-angled triangle, given the length of the hypotenuse and the other leg. Instead of subtracting the square of the known leg from the square of the hypotenuse, they incorrectly add the squares, or in some cases, subtract the square of the hypotenuse from the square of the known leg.

This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the Pythagorean theorem formula (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where a and b are the lengths of the legs and c is the length of the hypotenuse. Students may mistakenly apply the formula as a^2 = c^2 + b^2 or a^2 = b^2 + c^2 when trying to find one of the legs.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is given a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 units and one leg of 6 units. They need to find the length of the other leg. Instead of using the correct formula, they calculate 10^2 + 6^2.
- Case 2: In a problem where the hypotenuse is 15 units and one leg is 9 units, a student tries to find the length of the other leg by calculating 9^2 + 15^2.
- Case 3: Given a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 20 units and one leg of 12 units, a student incorrectly calculates the length of the other leg as 20^2 + 12^2."
616,Does not understand that 2n represents an even number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that the algebraic expression ""2n"" represents a pattern where every value will be an even number, due to the multiplication by 2. They may not connect the algebraic representation with the properties of even numbers. 

This misconception can manifest in various situations, such as:

- When asked to generate a sequence of numbers represented by 2n and they include odd numbers in the sequence.
- When solving equations or inequalities involving 2n and they do not take into account the even nature of the values.
- When making general statements about the properties of 2n, such as not recognizing that 2n will always be divisible by 2.
- When analyzing number patterns or sequences and they fail to recognize that 2n represents a sequence of even numbers.
- When solving problems that involve identifying even or odd numbers and they do not recognize 2n as a representation of even numbers."
617,Does not apply the inverse function to every term in an expression,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that certain operations or functions, such as addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, squaring/square root, etc., have inverse operations that must be applied to every term within an expression in order to undo or reverse the original operation. Instead, they may only apply the inverse function to one part of the expression or not apply it at all.

For example, when solving equations, this misconception can lead to errors such as:

- Case 1: Not distributing a negative sign to all terms inside the parentheses, e.g., -(2x + 3) = -2x + 3.
- Case 2: Not dividing every term by the same number when solving an equation, e.g., 2x + 4 = 6, where a student might only divide 2x by 2 but not 4.
- Case 3: Not applying the square root to both terms when solving an equation, e.g., (x + 1)^2 = 9, where a student might take the square root of only one side of the equation.
- Case 4: Not subtracting a constant from both sides of an equation, e.g., 2x + 5 = 11, where a student might subtract 5 from only one side."
618,Does not recall rectangle side length property,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to remember that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length. This fundamental property of rectangles is crucial for various geometric calculations, such as finding the perimeter or area of a rectangle.

This misconception may manifest in various ways, including:

- Incorrectly calculating the perimeter of a rectangle by adding the lengths of all four sides without recognizing that opposite sides have the same length.
- Failing to recognize that if one pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral have the same length, it does not necessarily mean the shape is a rectangle, as the other pair of sides must also be equal.
- Struggling to identify or create rectangles with specific dimensions, as they do not recall that opposite sides must be equal.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

- Case 1: A student is asked to find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 6 cm and a width of 4 cm. They incorrectly add 6 + 4 + 5 + 3, failing to recognize that the opposite sides have the same length.
- Case 2: A student is given a set of quadrilaterals and asked to identify which ones are rectangles. They incorrectly identify a quadrilateral with only one pair of equal opposite sides as a rectangle.
- Case 3: A student is tasked with drawing a rectangle with a length of 8 cm and a width of 5 cm. They draw a quadrilateral with the correct length, but the opposite sides have different lengths."
619,Divided by 10 rather than 100,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are required to convert a percentage to a decimal or divide an amount by a percentage. They may incorrectly divide by 10 instead of 100. This is often due to a misunderstanding of the place value system, specifically the relationship between percentages, decimals, and fractions. Students may struggle to recognize that the word ""percent"" means ""out of 100"" and therefore requires division by 100.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When converting a percentage to a decimal, e.g., 25% incorrectly becomes 2.5 instead of 0.25.
- When calculating a percentage of a quantity, e.g., 25% of 200 incorrectly becomes 20 instead of 50.
- When finding the original amount before a percentage increase or decrease, e.g., an item is on sale for 25% off its original price of $200, and students incorrectly calculate the original price by dividing $150 (the sale price) by 10 instead of 100.
- When calculating interest rates or investment returns, e.g., a 5% annual interest rate is applied to a principal amount, and students incorrectly divide the principal by 10 instead of 100 to find the interest earned."
620,Gives the vertex instead of the 3-letter angle notation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify or name a specific angle in a diagram, but instead of using the correct 3-letter angle notation (e.g. ∠ABC), they only give the vertex of the angle (e.g. point B). This shows that the student has identified the location of the angle, but does not understand or recall the proper notation for naming angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify corresponding angles in similar or congruent triangles, they might only write the vertex of the angle instead of the full 3-letter notation.
- When students are asked to name angles in a diagram and they only label the vertex, without including the two arms of the angle.
- When students are solving problems involving angles in a geometric figure, such as a triangle or quadrilateral, and they use the vertex instead of the 3-letter notation to refer to the angles.
- When students are working with angle properties, such as complementary or supplementary angles, and they use the vertex instead of the 3-letter notation to identify the angles involved."
621,Believes the negative of a positive squared (where there are no brackets) gives a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students incorrectly apply the rule that the square of a negative number is positive, to expressions involving the negative of a squared number. They may incorrectly assume that the negative sign is part of the number being squared, rather than being applied after the squaring operation. For example, they may think that -3^2 is equal to (-3)^2, which is 9. However, in reality, the exponentiation operation (squaring) is evaluated before the negation, so -3^2 is actually -(3^2), which is -9.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Simplifying expressions like -2^2 or -5^2
- Evaluating expressions like -x^2 when x is a positive number
- Solving equations that involve squared terms with negative coefficients, such as -x^2 + 4 = 0
- Interpreting the results of calculations involving negative numbers and exponents, such as -2^3 or -4^2."
622,Thinks the gradient of a line is found from 2 points by finding the length of that line between those points,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient and mistakenly believe that it is calculated by finding the length of the line segment between two points, rather than understanding that the gradient is a measure of the rate of change of the line, which is calculated as the ratio of the vertical distance (rise) to the horizontal distance (run) between the two points.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given two points on a coordinate plane and asked to find the gradient of the line passing through them, they may draw the line and measure its length, rather than using the coordinates to calculate the rise and run.
- When students are working with graphs and are asked to identify the steepest or shallowest line, they may mistakenly choose the line that appears to be the longest or shortest, rather than considering the rate of change of each line.
- When students are solving problems involving the gradient of a line in real-world contexts, such as calculating the steepness of a slope or the rate of change of a quantity, they may apply the incorrect method of finding the length of the line, leading to incorrect conclusions."
623,Assumes the denominator is divided by the numerator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of fractions and believe that the denominator is divided by the numerator, rather than the numerator being divided by the denominator. For instance, they might think that the fraction 3/4 means 4 divided by 3, rather than 3 divided by 4.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions, students may flip the numerator and denominator and then divide, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, when simplifying the fraction 6/8, they might divide 8 by 6.
- When comparing fractions, students may incorrectly compare the denominators instead of comparing the equivalent ratios. For example, when comparing the fractions 1/2 and 2/3, they might say that 2/3 is smaller because 3 is larger than 2.
- When performing fraction operations, such as addition or subtraction, students may mistakenly divide the denominators instead of finding a common denominator. For example, when adding 1/4 and 1/6, they might divide 4 by 6 or 6 by 4.
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, students may incorrectly divide the denominator by the whole number part. For example, when converting 2 3/4 to an improper fraction, they might divide 4 by 2."
624,"In ratio question where one side of ratio is given, treats that as the total","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a ratio problem where one side of the ratio is provided, and they mistakenly assume that the given value represents the total amount or quantity. They fail to recognize that the given value is only a part of the whole and that the ratio represents a proportion of the total. As a result, they may incorrectly calculate the other side of the ratio or the total amount.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

* A recipe requires a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour. If 6 cups of sugar are needed, students might assume that 6 cups is the total amount of the mixture, rather than just the sugar component.
* A car travels 120 miles in a ratio of 3:5 of distance traveled to fuel consumed. Students might think that 120 miles is the total distance traveled, rather than just the part of the ratio representing distance.
* A bag contains a ratio of 4:7 of red to blue marbles. If 12 red marbles are in the bag, students might assume that 12 is the total number of marbles, rather than just the number of red marbles."
625,Confuses corresponding and vertically opposite angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between corresponding angles and vertically opposite angles. They may mistakenly believe that corresponding angles and vertically opposite angles are the same thing or have the same properties. 

Corresponding angles are pairs of angles that are in the same relative position in two intersecting lines, but on different sides of the transversal line. 

Vertically opposite angles, on the other hand, are pairs of angles formed when two lines intersect, and they lie opposite each other.

Students may incorrectly think that both corresponding angles and vertically opposite angles are equal in all cases, without realizing that the equality of corresponding angles depends on the presence of parallel lines, while vertically opposite angles are always equal regardless of the lines being parallel or not.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying angle relationships in diagrams with intersecting lines.
- When solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals.
- When determining the size of angles in geometric shapes, such as triangles and quadrilaterals.
- When explaining why certain angles are equal in measure."
626,Thinks the difference between a positive number and a negative number is equal to the positive number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of subtracting a negative number. They tend to believe that subtracting a negative number is the same as ignoring the negative sign and just taking the positive value. For example, they might think that 5 - (-3) is equal to 5, because they are simply ""removing"" the negative sign from the -3 and not performing the actual subtraction.

This misconception can also be a result of overreliance on absolute value or the magnitude of numbers, where students only focus on the size of the numbers without considering the direction or sign. They might think that the difference between two numbers is always the positive value, regardless of the signs.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

- When solving simple subtraction problems involving negative numbers, such as 7 - (-2) or 3 - (-5).
- When dealing with word problems that involve temperature changes, such as ""If the temperature dropped from 10°C to -5°C, how much did it decrease?""
- When graphing or interpreting number lines, and students need to find the distance between a positive and a negative number.
- When solving algebraic equations that involve subtracting negative numbers, such as 2x - (-3) = 5."
627,Does not realise similar has a specific mathematical meaning,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe the term ""similar"" in a mathematical context means ""almost the same"" or ""looks like,"" rather than understanding that it has a specific, precise definition in geometry. In mathematics, similarity refers to the relationship between two shapes that have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify shapes as similar based on superficial characteristics, such as color, orientation, or approximate size, rather than checking for proportional corresponding sides and congruent corresponding angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two shapes that have the same color or pattern, but different sizes, and assuming they are similar.
- When looking at two shapes that are oriented differently, but are actually similar, and failing to recognize the similarity.
- When faced with a problem that requires identifying similar shapes in a real-world context, such as architecture or design, and relying on visual appearance rather than mathematical criteria.
- When solving problems involving scale drawings or models, and assuming that any shape that ""looks like"" the original is similar, without checking for mathematical similarity.
- When working with geometric transformations, such as enlargements or reductions, and failing to recognize that the resulting shapes are similar to the original shape."
628,"When factorising, finds a factor that goes into only the first term of the expression","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorisation in algebra and they tend to focus only on the first term of the expression. They incorrectly believe that finding a factor that only goes into the first term is sufficient to factorise the entire expression. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of factorisation, which requires finding a common factor that divides all terms of the expression.

For example, when given an expression like 6x + 8, a student with this misconception might say that 2x is a factor because 2x goes into 6x, without considering whether 2x also goes into the second term, 8.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

- Factorising simple expressions, such as 4x + 6, where students might say 2x is a factor without checking the second term.
- Factorising quadratic expressions, like x^2 + 5x, where students might incorrectly factor out an x without considering the constant term.
- When factorising expressions with multiple variables, such as 2x + 3y, students might focus only on one variable and ignore the other."
629,Thinks there are 1000mm in a centimetre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between units of measurement in the metric system. They may mistakenly believe that there are 1000 millimetres (mm) in a centimetre (cm), when in fact, there are 10 mm in a cm. This error could stem from confusing the conversion between millimetres and metres, where 1 metre is indeed equal to 1000 mm, but incorrectly applying this conversion to centimetres.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When converting measurements from millimetres to centimetres in a problem, such as ""If a pencil is 150 mm long, how many centimetres is it?""
- When comparing the lengths of objects measured in millimetres and centimetres, such as ""Which is longer, a 500 mm ruler or a 5 cm pencil?""
- When solving problems involving the addition or subtraction of measurements in millimetres and centimetres, such as ""If a bookshelf is 300 mm wide and a book is 2 cm thick, how much space will be left on the bookshelf after placing the book?"""
630,Does not know parallel lines have equal gradients ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize that parallel lines have the same gradient or slope. They may believe that parallel lines can have different gradients, or they may not be aware of the relationship between parallel lines and their gradients. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of parallel lines, or a failure to connect the idea of parallel lines with the concept of gradient.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify whether two lines are parallel based on their equations, and they fail to check if the gradients are equal.
- When students are given the equations of two lines and asked to determine if they are parallel, and they incorrectly conclude that the lines are parallel even though the gradients are different.
- When students are asked to find the equation of a line that is parallel to a given line, and they fail to use the same gradient in the new equation.
- When students are working with graphs and are asked to identify parallel lines, but they rely solely on visual inspection rather than checking the gradients of the lines."
631,"When calculating the mean from a list of data, adds up the numbers but does not divide","Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the initial step of calculating the mean, which is to add up all the numbers in the list, but they fail to complete the process by not dividing the sum by the total number of values. This indicates a lack of understanding of the mean as an average value that represents the distribution of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the mean of a set of exam scores, a student adds up all the scores but presents the sum as the mean, forgetting to divide by the number of students.
- In a survey, a student is tasked with calculating the mean height of a group of people and adds up all the heights but doesn't account for the number of people in the group.
- When calculating the average score of a series of games, a student adds up the scores but doesn't divide by the number of games played, resulting in an incorrect mean score."
632,Confuses range and interquartile range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the range and interquartile range (IQR) in data sets. The range is often mistakenly assumed to be the same as the IQR or vice versa. Students may think that both terms refer to the spread of the data, but they fail to understand the distinct calculations and interpretations of each measure.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the spread of a data set, a student may use the range (the difference between the highest and lowest values) instead of the IQR (the difference between the upper and lower quartiles) to describe the data's variability.
- When comparing the variability of two or more data sets, a student might mistakenly use the range of one data set to compare with the IQR of another, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In a graph or chart, a student may mislabel the range as the IQR or vice versa, showing a lack of understanding of these distinct statistical measures.
- When asked to describe the spread of a data set in words, a student might incorrectly use the terms ""range"" and ""interquartile range"" interchangeably, demonstrating their confusion."
633,Does not understand how to subtract algebraic fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to apply the rules of subtracting fractions to algebraic expressions. They may incorrectly subtract the numerators and denominators separately, or fail to find a common denominator when the fractions have different denominators. Additionally, students may have difficulty handling the algebraic terms, such as variables and constants, within the fractions. They might not understand that the rules for subtracting fractions, such as finding a common denominator and combining like terms, still apply when working with algebraic expressions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When subtracting two fractions with different denominators, e.g. (3x/4) - (2x/5)
* When subtracting a fraction from a whole number or another fraction with a variable in the numerator or denominator, e.g. 2 - (x/3) or (2x/3) - 1
* When dealing with fractions that have both variables and constants in the numerator or denominator, e.g. (2x+1)/(x+2) - (x-1)/(x+2)
* When working with more complex algebraic expressions involving fractions, e.g. subtracting fractions with multiple variables or nested fractions."
634,Does not know the term numerator,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unfamiliar with the term ""numerator"" in a fraction. A numerator is the top number of a fraction, which represents the number of equal parts being referred to. Students with this misconception may struggle to identify or label the numerator in a fraction, leading to difficulties in understanding and working with fractions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to fractions and are asked to identify the numerator in a simple fraction, such as 1/2 or 3/4.
- When students are asked to compare fractions and need to identify the numerator to determine which fraction is larger or smaller.
- When students are working with equivalent fractions and need to identify the numerator to simplify or compare fractions.
- When students are solving problems involving fractions, such as adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, and need to identify the numerator to perform the calculation correctly."
635,Believes you cannot find the angle size in a pie chart when given its percentage value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to connect the percentage value of a pie chart sector to the corresponding central angle. They may believe that percentages only relate to proportions of the data, but not to the actual angle measurements in the chart. As a result, when given a percentage value for a sector, they may think that it's impossible to determine the angle size without additional information.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given a pie chart showing the distribution of favorite colors in a class, with 25% of students liking the color blue. When asked to find the angle size of the blue sector, the student may claim that it's impossible without knowing the number of degrees in the entire circle.
- A student is working on a problem involving a pie chart that represents the proportion of different types of music listened to by a group of people. If 30% of the group listens to pop music, the student may believe that they cannot find the angle size of the pop music sector without additional information about the circle.
- In a data analysis exercise, a student is presented with a pie chart showing the distribution of scores in a math test. If 40% of students scored above 80%, the student may think that they cannot determine the angle size of the corresponding sector in the pie chart."
636,Mixes up constant and coefficient in a worded substitution problem,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are given worded problems involving algebraic expressions and are asked to substitute values into the expression. The students struggle to differentiate between constants and coefficients, often substituting the given values in the wrong place or incorrectly combining them.

In algebraic expressions, constants are numbers that stand alone, while coefficients are numbers that multiply variables. For example, in the expression 3x + 4, the 3 is a coefficient (as it multiplies the variable x) and the 4 is a constant.

When faced with worded problems, students with this misconception may misread or misinterpret the given information, leading to incorrect substitutions. They might confuse the role of the constant and coefficient or fail to recognize which values correspond to which part of the algebraic expression.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Tom has 3 boxes of pens, each containing x pens. If he also has 5 loose pens, how many pens does Tom have in total? (Student may confuse the 3 as a constant instead of a coefficient of x.)
2. A bakery sells a total of 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 3 times as many whole wheat loaves as white bread loaves, and they sell x white bread loaves, how many whole wheat loaves do they sell? (Student may incorrectly substitute the given values, confusing the coefficient with the constant.)
3. A car travels at a speed of 50 miles per hour for x hours, and then an additional 10 miles. How far does the car travel in total? (Student may mix up the 50 as a constant instead of a coefficient of x, or incorrectly combine the values.)"
637,Does not recognise the corresponding sides in similar shapes or enlargements,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to identify the corresponding sides of similar shapes or enlargements, which can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions. They may not understand that corresponding sides of similar shapes are proportional, and that the ratio of corresponding sides is the scale factor. 

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When asked to identify corresponding sides in a pair of similar triangles, students may choose sides randomly or based on visual appearance rather than using mathematical criteria.
- When enlarging a shape, students may not recognize that corresponding sides of the original and enlarged shapes are proportional, leading to errors in calculating the dimensions of the enlarged shape.
- When comparing the perimeters or areas of similar shapes, students may not account for the proportional relationship between corresponding sides, resulting in incorrect comparisons.
- When solving problems involving similar shapes, students may not recognize that corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are proportional, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
638,Believes multiplication is not commutative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the order of numbers in a multiplication operation affects the result. They may think that a × b is not equal to b × a. This misunderstanding can stem from the way multiplication is initially introduced, often with an emphasis on the concept of repeated addition, which can lead to a fixed mental model of the multiplier and multiplicand having distinct roles.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with single-digit multiplication, students may believe that 2 × 3 is not the same as 3 × 2 because they are used to seeing the multiplication process as ""2 groups of 3"" instead of understanding that the result is the same regardless of the order.
- When working with multi-digit numbers, students might assume that 4 × 25 is not equal to 25 × 4, possibly due to the way they have been calculating the products.
- When solving word problems involving multiplication, students may get different answers depending on the order in which they multiply the numbers, not realizing that the result should be the same regardless of the order."
639,Believes unrelated acute/obtuse angles in a diagram are supplementary,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any two angles in a diagram, regardless of their relationship, must add up to 180 degrees if one is acute (less than 90 degrees) and the other is obtuse (greater than 90 degrees). This misconception stems from a misunderstanding of the definition of supplementary angles, which are angles that add up to 180 degrees, but must be adjacent or related in some way.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When students are presented with a diagram containing multiple angles and are asked to identify supplementary angles.
* When solving problems involving the sum of angles in a polygon, students may incorrectly assume that any acute and obtuse angles are supplementary.
* In geometry problems, students may mistakenly use this misconception to calculate missing angles in a diagram, leading to incorrect solutions.
* When working with complex diagrams, such as those involving intersecting lines or transversals, students may misidentify unrelated acute and obtuse angles as supplementary."
640,Does not find the angle being asked,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify or calculate a specific angle in a geometric shape, but they fail to correctly determine which angle is being referred to in the problem. This can be due to a lack of understanding of angle notation, confusion between different types of angles (e.g., acute, obtuse, right), or difficulty in visualizing the shape and identifying the relevant angle.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* In a triangle, a student is asked to find the measure of angle B, but they calculate the measure of angle A instead.
* A student is given a diagram of a quadrilateral and asked to find the measure of the obtuse angle, but they identify the acute angle instead.
* A problem asks a student to calculate the sum of the interior angles of a polygon, but they mistakenly calculate the sum of the exterior angles.
* A student is given a 3D shape, such as a pyramid, and asked to find the measure of a specific angle, but they have difficulty visualizing the shape and identifying the correct angle."
641,Does not add on the constant in a worded substitution problem,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are given a worded problem involving substitution into an algebraic expression or equation. They may correctly substitute the given values into the expression, but then forget to add (or subtract) a constant term that is also part of the expression. This can lead to an incorrect solution. The students might focus solely on the variables and coefficients, neglecting the constants.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Tom has 5 more than 3 times as many pencils as his friend. If his friend has 4 pencils, how many pencils does Tom have? (Student might write 3 x 4, but forget to add 5.)
- A bakery sells a total of 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 30 more whole wheat loaves than white bread, and they sell 40 white bread loaves, how many whole wheat loaves do they sell? (Student might write 40 + 30, but forget to consider this as part of the total 250 loaves.)
- A car rental company charges a base fee of $20 plus an additional $0.25 per mile driven. If a customer drives 120 miles, how much will they be charged in total? (Student might write 0.25 x 120, but forget to add the $20 base fee.)"
642,Thinks x = ? is a horizontal line through ? ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the equation x = ? as a horizontal line passing through the point ?. They may mistakenly believe that the variable x represents the y-coordinate of a point on the graph, rather than the x-coordinate. As a result, they may think that the graph of x = ? is a horizontal line that intersects the y-axis at the point ?, rather than a vertical line that intersects the x-axis at the point ?.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* Graphing the equation x = 5, where students may draw a horizontal line through the point (0, 5) instead of a vertical line through the point (5, 0).
* Solving equations like x = 2, where students may think that the solution is a horizontal line through the point (0, 2) instead of a vertical line through the point (2, 0).
* Identifying the graph of x = 0, where students may believe it is a horizontal line through the origin (0, 0) instead of the y-axis itself."
643,Think 1km = 1 mile,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not familiar with the conversion between different units of measurement, particularly between the metric system and the imperial system. They may mistakenly believe that 1 kilometer (km) is equal to 1 mile, likely due to a lack of understanding of the actual conversion factor. In reality, 1 mile is approximately equal to 1.60934 kilometers.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When reading road signs or maps that display distances in both kilometers and miles, students may think the values are interchangeable.
- When comparing the distances of races or events, such as a 1km run versus a 1-mile run, students may believe they are equivalent.
- When working on problems that involve converting between kilometers and miles, such as calculating the distance traveled by a vehicle or the length of a route.
- When interpreting data or statistics that involve distances measured in both kilometers and miles, students may fail to account for the difference in units."
644,May have estimated when using ratios with geometry,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with geometric problems involving ratios, such as similar triangles or scaling shapes. They may incorrectly assume that they can simply estimate the lengths of sides or the scale factor without actually calculating the ratios. This can lead to inaccurate answers, especially when dealing with complex or non-intuitive shapes.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the height of a building using similar triangles, a student may estimate the lengths of the shadows and the building's height instead of calculating the ratio of corresponding sides.
- When scaling up or down a shape, a student may estimate the scale factor instead of calculating it accurately, resulting in an incorrect scaled shape.
- When finding the missing length in a pair of similar triangles, a student may estimate the length based on how the triangles look instead of using the ratio of corresponding sides.
- When solving problems involving the area or volume of similar shapes, a student may estimate the scale factor and use it to calculate the area or volume, leading to an incorrect answer."
645,Believes enlargement by scale factor -1 exchanges the x and y coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of enlargement by a negative scale factor. They mistakenly believe that multiplying the coordinates of a point by -1 will simply swap the x and y coordinates, rather than understanding that it actually reflects the point across the origin (0, 0) while maintaining the same distance from it.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When a student is asked to enlarge a shape by a scale factor of -1 and they simply swap the x and y coordinates of each point, rather than changing their signs.
- When a student is given a point (x, y) and asked to find its image after an enlargement by a scale factor of -1, and they answer (y, x) instead of (-x, -y).
- When a student is working with graphs and is asked to enlarge a function by a scale factor of -1, and they incorrectly swap the x and y values of each point on the graph, rather than reflecting the graph across the origin."
646,Confuses scalene and right angle triangles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a right-angled triangle cannot be a scalene triangle, or vice versa. They may think that the terms 'scalene' and 'right-angled' are mutually exclusive, and that a triangle can only be one or the other. In reality, the terms describe different properties of a triangle. A scalene triangle is one where all sides are of different lengths, whereas a right-angled triangle is one where one angle is 90 degrees. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are shown a right-angled triangle with two sides of equal length (i.e., an isosceles right-angled triangle) and assume that all right-angled triangles must have two equal sides, therefore, any triangle with all sides of different lengths cannot be right-angled.
- When students are asked to classify triangles and they come across a scalene triangle with one angle that happens to be 90 degrees, and they incorrectly assume it cannot be both scalene and right-angled.
- When students are given a problem that involves finding the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle, and they mistakenly believe that the triangle must be isosceles because it is right-angled, rather than considering the possibility that it could be scalene."
647,Thinks co-interior angles sum to 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that co-interior angles, which are pairs of angles formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines, sum to 90 degrees. This is incorrect, as the actual sum of co-interior angles is 180 degrees. Students may mistakenly apply the rule for complementary angles (which sum to 90 degrees) to co-interior angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals, students may incorrectly calculate the measure of co-interior angles by subtracting from 90 degrees.
- In geometric construction tasks, students may draw incorrect conclusions about the properties of co-interior angles, leading to errors in their diagrams.
- When solving angle problems in real-world contexts, such as architecture or engineering, students may apply the incorrect sum of co-interior angles, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
648,Finds volume when asked for surface area,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the surface area of a three-dimensional shape, but they mistakenly calculate the volume instead. This often occurs due to a lack of understanding of the difference between the two concepts. Students may confuse the formulas for surface area and volume or incorrectly apply the formulas. They may also have difficulty visualizing the shape and understanding what is being asked.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When asked to find the surface area of a cube, students may give the formula for the volume of a cube (side^3) instead of the formula for the surface area (6 * side^2).
- When asked to find the surface area of a cylinder, students may provide the formula for the volume of a cylinder (π * radius^2 * height) instead of the formula for the surface area (2 * π * radius * (radius + height)).
- When given a word problem that involves finding the amount of material needed to cover the surface of an object, students may incorrectly calculate the volume of the object instead of the surface area."
649,"Beileves you can use the full length when finding an area of part of a composite shape, when part of the length is needed","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a composite shape that consists of multiple parts, such as a rectangle with a smaller rectangle or triangle removed from it. Some students mistakenly believe that they can use the full length of the shape to calculate the area, even if only a part of that length is relevant to the specific section they are trying to find the area of.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a room with an L-shape, where students might use the full length of the room to calculate the area, instead of using the relevant lengths for each part of the L-shape.
- When calculating the area of a garden with a rectangular lawn and a triangular flowerbed, where students might use the full length of the lawn to find the area of the flowerbed, instead of using the length of the flowerbed itself.
- When finding the area of a shape made up of multiple rectangles, where students might use the full length of the shape to find the area of each rectangle, instead of using the relevant lengths for each individual rectangle."
650,Believes mean is total divided by number of groups,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean. They believe that to find the mean, you divide the total sum of values by the number of groups or categories, rather than the total number of individual data points. This error can occur when students are dealing with data that is presented in groups or categories, and they fail to recognize that the mean is a measure of central tendency that requires the total number of individual data points to be taken into account.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are calculating the mean of a set of exam scores and they divide the total score by the number of classes or groups, rather than the total number of students.
- When analyzing the average height of students in different age groups, and they divide the total height by the number of age groups, rather than the total number of students.
- When calculating the mean of a set of data that is presented in a frequency table, and they divide the total value by the number of frequency groups, rather than the total number of data points."
651,Forgets you need a protractor to measure angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can accurately measure angles using only a ruler or by estimating the angle's size. They may incorrectly assume that angles can be measured by simply counting the number of degrees between two lines or by using their own judgment to estimate the angle's size. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the importance of using precise tools, such as protractors, to measure angles accurately.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are drawing or measuring shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, and need to determine the size of the angles.
* When students are solving problems involving the properties of angles, such as calculating the sum of interior angles in a polygon.
* When students are working with real-world applications, such as designing buildings or bridges, where accurate angle measurements are crucial.
* When students are using technology, such as geometry software, to measure angles and assume that the software is automatically measuring the angles correctly without the need for a protractor."
652,Mixes up the numerator and denominator when writing a division as a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the relationship between division and fractions. They may incorrectly write the remainder or the number being divided as the numerator, and the divisor as the denominator, or vice versa. This can stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the fact that fractions can represent division.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When rewriting a division problem as a fraction, e.g., 12 ÷ 4 = ? (students might write 4/12 instead of 12/4 or the simplified 3/1).
- When solving word problems involving sharing or grouping, e.g., ""If I have 18 pencils and I want to put them in boxes of 3 pencils each, how many boxes can I make?"" (students might write 3/18 instead of 18/3).
- When converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions, e.g., 3 1/2 = ? (students might write 2/3 instead of 7/2).
- When simplifying fractions after dividing, e.g., 24 ÷ 6 = ? (students might write 6/24 instead of 24/6 or the simplified 4/1)."
653,Does not have when calculating the area of a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the formula for the area of a triangle only requires the base or the height, but not both, or they simply multiply the base and height without dividing by 2. They may also forget to consider the relationship between the base and the height, leading to incorrect calculations. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of area and the specific formula for the area of a triangle.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the area of a triangle with a given base and height, a student might simply multiply the two values without dividing by 2, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- When given the base of a triangle, a student might assume that the height is the same as the base and calculate the area using this incorrect assumption.
- When shown a triangle with a given area, a student might struggle to find the base or height, or might incorrectly assume that the area is equal to the base or height alone.
- When asked to compare the areas of two triangles, a student with this misconception might incorrectly calculate the areas and arrive at an incorrect conclusion."
654,Believes an interior angle in a regular polygon can be found using 180(n+2)/n,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students incorrectly apply the formula for the sum of interior angles in a polygon to find the measure of a single interior angle in a regular polygon. They may mistakenly believe that simply dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of sides (n) will give them the correct formula. However, the correct formula involves dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of sides, but the sum of the interior angles is actually (n-2)*180, not 180(n+2). As a result, the students end up with an incorrect formula: 180(n+2)/n.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the interior angle of a regular hexagon, a student may use the incorrect formula 180(6+2)/6 instead of the correct formula.
- When asked to find the interior angle of a regular octagon, a student may apply the incorrect formula 180(8+2)/8.
- In a problem involving a regular polygon with 12 sides, a student may mistakenly use the formula 180(12+2)/12 to find the measure of a single interior angle."
655,Assumes that a list is given in size order,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students assume that a given list of numbers or data is already arranged in order from smallest to largest or vice versa. They might overlook the need to check and arrange the data in the correct order before performing calculations, such as finding the median, mode, or range.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Finding the median of a set of numbers without first arranging them in order, resulting in an incorrect middle value.
2. Calculating the range of a dataset without checking if the values are in order, leading to an incorrect range.
3. Identifying the mode of a dataset without first arranging the values, resulting in an incorrect mode or multiple modes.
4. Interpreting data in a graph or chart without considering the order of the data, leading to incorrect conclusions.
5. Performing statistical calculations, such as quartiles or percentiles, without first ensuring the data is in order, resulting in incorrect results."
656,Reverses the order of operations but does not apply the inverse operations when finding the input of a function machine,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with function machines, which are often used to represent simple algebraic functions. The students understand that they need to reverse the order of operations, but they fail to apply the inverse operations correctly.

For example, if a function machine has two operations: ""add 3"" and then ""multiply by 2"", students may correctly reverse the order to ""divide by 2"" and then ""subtract 3"", but they may not apply these inverse operations correctly.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. A function machine has the following operations: ""add 2"" and then ""multiply by 4"". Students may reverse the order to ""divide by 4"" and then ""subtract 2"", but they may not apply the division and subtraction correctly to find the input.

2. A function machine has the following operations: ""subtract 1"" and then ""multiply by 3"". Students may reverse the order to ""divide by 3"" and then ""add 1"", but they may not apply the division and addition correctly to find the input.

3. A function machine has the following operations: ""multiply by 5"" and then ""add 2"". Students may reverse the order to ""subtract 2"" and then ""divide by 5"", but they may not apply the subtraction and division correctly to find the input."
657,Has completed only one of the two operations.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are required to perform two or more operations in an expression, but they only complete one of them. For example, when adding or subtracting fractions, students may add or subtract the numerators, but forget to find a common denominator, or when performing calculations involving decimals, they may perform the operation on the whole number part but forget to perform the same operation on the decimal part.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions such as 3 + 4 × 5, where students may only add 3 and 4.
- Solving equations like 2x + 5 = 11, where students may subtract 5 from both sides but forget to divide by 2.
- Converting between units of measurement, such as converting 3 feet 5 inches to inches, where students may only multiply the feet by 12 but forget to add the inches.
- Calculating the area of a rectangle, where students may multiply the length by the width but forget to square the units.
- Solving problems involving percentages, such as finding 25% of 120, where students may only multiply 120 by 0.2 and forget to multiply by 5."
658,Thinks they double the numerator to turn a fraction into a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to convert a fraction into a percentage, they simply need to double the numerator. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the actual process of converting fractions to percentages, which involves converting the fraction to a decimal and then multiplying by 100. 

For example, when given the fraction 1/4 and asked to convert it into a percentage, a student with this misconception may incorrectly double the numerator (1 x 2 = 2) and assume the answer is 2%, instead of converting the fraction to a decimal (1/4 = 0.25) and then to a percentage (0.25 x 100 = 25%).

Cases when this misconception will occur:

- Converting fractions to percentages in simple arithmetic problems (e.g., 3/10 as a percentage).
- Real-world applications, such as calculating discounts or probabilities, where fractions need to be converted to percentages.
- Interpreting data in statistics and graphing, where fractions may be presented and need to be converted to percentages for easier understanding.
- Word problems involving percentage calculations, where fractions are given and need to be converted to percentages to solve the problem."
659,Does not know how to write a fraction - just given an integer answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to express a part of a whole as a fraction, but instead, they provide an integer answer. This indicates that they do not fully understand the concept of fractions as a way to represent a proportion or a part of a whole. They may be thinking in terms of whole numbers only, and not considering the relationship between the part and the whole.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When asked to write a fraction to represent 3 out of 4 equal parts, the student answers ""3"" instead of ""3/4"".
* When asked to express 1/2 of a pizza that has been cut into 8 slices, the student answers ""4"" instead of ""4/8"" or ""1/2"".
* When asked to write a fraction to represent 2 out of 6 equal groups, the student answers ""2"" instead of ""2/6"" or ""1/3""."
660,Thinks that the perimeter on a square grid is the number of squares inside that are touching the perimeter of the shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the perimeter of a shape drawn on a square grid. They mistakenly believe that the perimeter is equal to the number of squares that are adjacent to the edge of the shape, rather than understanding that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. This can lead to an incorrect calculation of the perimeter, as they are counting the number of squares rather than the actual length of the sides.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When finding the perimeter of a rectangle or square drawn on a grid, where students may count the number of squares along the edge rather than multiplying the length and width by 2.
* When calculating the perimeter of a shape with a complex boundary, where students may struggle to distinguish between the number of squares touching the edge and the actual length of the perimeter.
* When comparing the perimeters of different shapes on a grid, where students may incorrectly conclude that the shape with more squares along its edge has a larger perimeter."
661,Confuses an expression with a term,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between an algebraic expression and a term within that expression. An expression is a collection of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations combined, while a term is a single part of the expression separated by addition or subtraction signs. Students with this misconception may treat the entire expression as a single entity or incorrectly apply rules meant for individual terms to the whole expression.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions, students might incorrectly combine terms that are not like terms.
- When solving equations, students may try to manipulate the entire expression as if it were a single term.
- When applying rules such as the distributive property, students might incorrectly distribute coefficients to the entire expression instead of individual terms.
- When comparing expressions, students may treat two expressions as equal if they contain the same variables, regardless of the operations or coefficients involved."
662,Believes that a number divided by itself equals the original number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of division as simply being the inverse operation of multiplication, without considering the case when the divisor is the same as the dividend. They may think that since a number multiplied by itself results in a larger value, dividing it by itself should also result in the same larger value. This misunderstanding leads them to believe that any number divided by itself will result in the original number, rather than understanding that any non-zero number divided by itself actually equals 1.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions with the same numerator and denominator, e.g. 5 ÷ 5 = ?
- When solving division problems with the same dividend and divisor, e.g. 8 ÷ 8 = ?
- When working with algebraic expressions involving variables, e.g. x ÷ x = ?
- When dealing with proportions and equivalent ratios in geometry and measurement, e.g. scaling a shape by a factor of 1:1."
663,Forgotten placeholders when rounding to significant figures,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers to a specific number of significant figures, but they forget to consider the placeholder zeros. They might round the number without maintaining the correct number of significant figures, often losing or gaining extra significant figures. This happens because they do not understand the role of placeholder zeros in maintaining the precision of the number when rounding to significant figures.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Rounding 4500 to 2 significant figures: students may write 45 instead of 4500, forgetting the placeholder zeros.
- Rounding 0.045 to 1 significant figure: students may write 0.05 instead of 0.05, but in some cases they may write 0.5, forgetting the placeholder zeros.
- Rounding 12000 to 3 significant figures: students may write 120 instead of 12000, forgetting the placeholder zeros."
664,"Believes -a is always smaller than a, ignoring the possibility that a is negative","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to negative numbers but still hold onto the idea that the negative sign always makes a number smaller. They fail to consider that when 'a' is a negative number, '-a' would actually be its positive counterpart, thus being larger. For example, if 'a' is -3, then '-a' would be 3, which is indeed larger. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of how negative numbers work and how the negative sign affects the value of a number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing the values of -x and x when x is a negative number.
- Solving inequalities involving negative numbers, such as -x > x.
- Interpreting the results of multiplying or dividing negative numbers, where the sign of the result may change.
- Graphing functions that involve negative numbers, such as f(x) = -x, and misunderstanding the behavior of the graph in different quadrants."
665,Believes that the gradient of a horizontal line is undefined,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient, which is a measure of how steep a line is. They may think that a horizontal line has an undefined gradient because it doesn't have a ""steepness"" in the same way that a vertical line does. They might also mistakenly apply the rule that division by zero is undefined to the gradient formula (rise over run), thinking that since there is no ""rise"" in a horizontal line, the gradient is undefined.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to find the gradient of a horizontal line on a graph, the student may write ""undefined"" instead of the correct answer.
- When comparing the steepness of different lines, the student may say that a horizontal line has no steepness or an undefined steepness.
- When solving problems involving the equations of horizontal lines, the student may incorrectly apply the concept of gradient, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When asked to identify the gradient of a line with a very small or zero slope, the student may incorrectly say it's undefined."
666,Thinks grams and tonnes are the same,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the vast difference in magnitude between grams and tonnes. They might think that grams and tonnes are interchangeable units of measurement for weight or mass, not realizing that 1 tonne is actually equal to 1,000 kilograms, and 1 kilogram is equal to 1,000 grams. This lack of understanding of the conversion factors between different units can lead to significant errors in calculations and real-world applications.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the weight of small objects (e.g., a pencil) to large objects (e.g., a car), students might use grams for both.
- In problems involving conversions between units, students might incorrectly convert tonnes to grams or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving large quantities of materials (e.g., the weight of cargo in a ship), students might use grams instead of tonnes, leading to incorrect calculations.
- In everyday conversations, students might use the terms 'grams' and 'tonnes' interchangeably, not realizing the significant difference between them."
667,Only considers elements in one set when asked to find the intersection of multiple sets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the intersection of multiple sets, but they only consider the elements in one of the sets. They might ignore the other sets or fail to recognize that the intersection requires common elements among all sets. As a result, they may incorrectly identify the intersection as simply the elements of one set, rather than the common elements shared among all sets.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with two or more sets with some common elements, students might only consider the elements of the first set and neglect to check if those elements are also present in the other sets.
- When one set is a subset of another, students might assume the intersection is simply the smaller set, without verifying if all elements of the smaller set are indeed common to both sets.
- When dealing with multiple sets with no obvious common elements, students might conclude that the intersection is empty without thoroughly checking for any shared elements among all sets.
- When working with word problems involving sets, such as finding the common characteristics among different groups, students might focus on the characteristics of one group and overlook the need to find commonalities among all groups."
668,Writes four symbols after rather than one before in Roman numerals,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the rules of writing Roman numerals. They may think that to represent a number, they need to add more symbols after a certain numeral, rather than understanding that Roman numerals use a combination of addition and subtraction principles. Specifically, they may incorrectly write four identical symbols in a row, such as IIII for 4, instead of using the correct notation IV, which uses one symbol before (I) and one after (V, but with a subtraction principle). This misconception reveals a lack of understanding of the Roman numeral system's rules and conventions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- Writing 4 as IIII instead of IV
- Writing 9 as VIIII instead of IX
- Writing 40 as XXXX instead of XL
- Writing 90 as LXXXX instead of XC"
669,Has used slant height and base to find area of a parallelogram rather than perpendicular height and base,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the formula for the area of a triangle or another shape to find the area of a parallelogram. They incorrectly use the slant height (the height of the parallelogram measured along a side) and the base of the parallelogram to calculate the area, rather than the perpendicular height (the height measured at a right angle to the base) and the base. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of the properties of parallelograms.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

1. Finding the area of a parallelogram with a slant height of 5 units, a base of 6 units, and a perpendicular height of 4 units. A student with this misconception may calculate the area as 5 x 6 = 30 square units, instead of the correct calculation of 4 x 6 = 24 square units.

2. Solving a problem where a parallelogram has a base of 8 units and a slant height of 9 units, and the student is asked to find the area. A student with this misconception may incorrectly use the slant height and base to calculate the area, without finding the perpendicular height.

3. Comparing the areas of two parallelograms with different slant heights but the same base and perpendicular height. A student with this misconception may incorrectly conclude that the parallelogram with the longer slant height has a larger area."
670,Counts the starting number when counting on,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count on a certain number of units from a given starting number. Instead of starting to count from the next number after the starting number, they incorrectly include the starting number as the first unit. For example, if asked to count on 3 from 5, they would count 5 as the first number, resulting in an incorrect answer of 8 (5, 6, 7, 8) instead of the correct answer of 8 (6, 7, 8).

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to count on 2 from 4 and they respond with 6 (4, 5, 6) instead of the correct count (5, 6).
- A student is given a number line and asked to count on 4 from 3, and they start counting from 3 (3, 4, 5, 6, 7) instead of from 4 (4, 5, 6, 7).
- A student is asked to solve a simple addition problem, such as 2 + 3, by counting on, and they start counting from 2 (2, 3, 4, 5) instead of from 3 (3, 4, 5)."
671,"When reading decimals on a number line, assumes each dash is 0.1","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to number lines with decimal values. They may incorrectly assume that every dash or mark on the number line represents an increment of 0.1, regardless of the actual scale. This misunderstanding can lead students to misread the decimal values on the number line.

For instance, if a number line has dashes at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and so on, a student with this misconception may incorrectly assume that the first dash after 0 represents 0.1, the second dash represents 0.2, and so on. This can cause confusion when trying to locate specific decimal values on the number line.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When a number line has irregular or variable intervals between dashes, leading students to misinterpret the scale.
- When students are asked to identify decimal values on a number line without explicit labels or markings.
- When comparing the position of different decimal values on a number line, such as determining which is greater or lesser.
- When using number lines to model real-world scenarios involving decimals, such as measuring lengths or temperatures."
672,When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives the next term,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify a specific term in a sequence, but instead of finding the term that corresponds to the given position, they simply provide the next term in the sequence. This shows a lack of understanding of how sequences work and how to navigate them. Students may be relying too heavily on pattern recognition and not fully grasping the concept of term-to-term relationships or the general formula for the sequence.

For example, if a student is given the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, ... and is asked for the 5th term, they may respond with 10 (the next term in the sequence), rather than 10 (which is actually the 5th term in this case) if the sequence had started counting from 2 as the first term and the correct answer would have been correct but, if the sequence had started from 2 and the question asked for 3rd term, the answer will be 6 not the next term which is 8. 

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- In an arithmetic sequence, when students are asked to find a term in the middle of the sequence, they may give the next term instead.
- When working with geometric sequences, students may struggle to find a specific term and resort to giving the next term in the sequence.
- In word problems involving sequences, students may misinterpret the question and provide the next term instead of the specific term requested."
673,Finds total instead of difference when asked 'How many more',"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the difference between two quantities, but instead of subtracting the smaller quantity from the larger one, they add the two quantities together, resulting in the total. This indicates a misunderstanding of the concept of ""how many more,"" which requires finding the difference or excess of one quantity over another.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Sarah has 15 pencils and her friend has 8 pencils. When asked how many more pencils Sarah has, the student may answer 23 (15 + 8) instead of 7 (15 - 8).
- Case 2: A basket contains 12 apples and another basket contains 5 apples. When asked how many more apples the first basket has, the student may answer 17 (12 + 5) instead of 7 (12 - 5).
- Case 3: A bookshelf has 20 books, and 12 books are added to it. When asked how many more books the bookshelf has now compared to the initial number, the student may answer 32 (20 + 12) instead of 12 (the actual increase)."
674,Thinks the inverse of addition is division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the opposite operation of addition is division, rather than subtraction. In other words, they think that to ""undo"" an addition operation, they need to divide, rather than subtract. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the relationships between different mathematical operations.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When asked to solve an equation like 5 + 3 = ?, and then asked to ""reverse"" the operation, students may respond with 8 ÷ 3 = ? instead of 8 - 3 = ?.
* When solving word problems that involve ""taking away"" or ""finding the difference"", students may incorrectly use division instead of subtraction.
* When working with number patterns or sequences that involve adding and then ""reversing"" the operation, students may use division instead of subtraction, leading to incorrect results."
675,"When interpolating using a line of best fit, reads off the value for the closest point to the line rather than the value given by the line of best fit ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to interpolate data using a line of best fit. Interpolation involves estimating a value within a set of data points. The line of best fit is a straight line that best represents the relationship between two variables. However, some students mistakenly believe that to find the interpolated value, they should identify the data point closest to the line of best fit and use its value instead of using the actual line of best fit.

This misconception occurs when students are not fully understanding the purpose of a line of best fit, which is to provide a model that can be used to estimate values between data points. They might think that the goal is to find the closest data point to the line, rather than using the line itself to estimate the value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to estimate the value of a variable at a specific point that falls between two data points on a scatter plot.
- When a student is tasked with predicting a value based on a trend shown by a line of best fit, but instead of using the line, they choose a data point that is closest to the line.
- When a student is working with a set of data that has a clear linear relationship, but they fail to use the line of best fit to estimate a value, opting instead for the closest data point."
676,Does not recognise that an equation will stay balanced if all terms are multiplied/divided by the same amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that an equation is a statement of equality between two expressions. They may believe that the equation is ""broken"" or changed if they perform the same operation on both sides, rather than recognizing that the equation remains balanced as long as the same operation is applied to both sides. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly solve equations or manipulate formulas.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When a student is solving a simple linear equation like 2x = 6 and they need to isolate the variable x by dividing both sides by 2. They may resist or fail to recognize that dividing both sides by 2 will maintain the equality.
- When a student is working with equivalent ratios or proportions and needs to scale up or down by multiplying or dividing both sides of the equation by the same factor.
- When a student is manipulating formulas, such as doubling or tripling a recipe, and fails to recognize that all the ingredients must be multiplied by the same factor to maintain the equality of the recipe."
677,"When asked to subtract a fraction from a unit, removes the unit value from the numerator.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to subtract a fraction from a whole unit, but instead of performing the subtraction operation correctly, they mistakenly remove the unit value from the numerator of the fraction. This indicates a misunderstanding of the concept of fractions as parts of a whole and how to perform operations with them. The students may be treating the unit as if it's a number that can be directly subtracted from the numerator, rather than understanding that the fraction is a proportion of the whole unit.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Subtracting 1/4 from 1: Instead of finding the equivalent fraction for 1 (4/4) and subtracting 1/4 to get 3/4, the student may subtract 1 from the numerator 4, resulting in an incorrect answer of 3.
* Subtracting 3/8 from 1: The student may remove 1 from the numerator 3, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2/8, instead of finding the equivalent fraction for 1 (8/8) and subtracting 3/8 to get 5/8.
* Subtracting 2/5 from 1: The student may subtract 1 from the numerator 2, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/5, instead of finding the equivalent fraction for 1 (5/5) and subtracting 2/5 to get 3/5."
678,Believes you cannot find the mode from a pie chart,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand that a mode can be identified from any type of data representation, including pie charts. They might believe that modes are only associated with data presented in bar charts, line graphs, or raw data sets. As a result, when given a pie chart, they may struggle to identify the mode, thinking that it is not possible to do so.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- A student is given a pie chart showing the favorite colors of a class and is asked to identify the most popular color (mode).
- A student is analyzing a pie chart representing the sales of different products and is asked to determine the best-selling product (mode).
- A student is interpreting a pie chart displaying the time spent on various activities during a day and is asked to identify the most time-consuming activity (mode)."
679,Gives a fraction when asked for a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to express a number in decimal form but instead provide the equivalent fraction. It's possible that the students have a stronger foundation in fractions and are more comfortable expressing numbers in fractional form, but struggle to convert them to decimals. This misconception may also be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between fractions and decimals, or an inability to perform the necessary calculations to convert a fraction to a decimal.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is asked to express 1/2 as a decimal and responds with 1/2 instead of 0.5.
* When asked to calculate the decimal equivalent of 3/4, a student answers 3/4 instead of 0.75.
* A student is given a problem that requires converting a mixed number to a decimal, such as 2 1/4, and responds with 2 1/4 instead of 2.25.
* When solving a division problem, such as 3 ÷ 4, a student answers 3/4 instead of 0.75.
* A student is asked to round a fraction to a certain number of decimal places and responds with the original fraction instead of the rounded decimal."
680,Does not know the term transversal,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unfamiliar with the term ""transversal"" in the context of geometry, specifically in the study of lines and angles. A transversal is a line that intersects two or more other lines, and it is a fundamental concept in understanding various geometric relationships, such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and alternate exterior angles. Students who are not familiar with the term transversal may struggle to identify and work with these relationships, leading to difficulties in solving problems and understanding geometric concepts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify corresponding angles or alternate interior angles in a diagram, they may not recognize the role of the transversal in defining these relationships.
* When students are given a problem involving two or more lines intersected by a transversal, they may not know how to use the properties of transversals to solve the problem.
* When students are asked to draw or describe a diagram involving lines and angles, they may not include a transversal or may not label it correctly, indicating a lack of understanding of its significance.
* When students are working with theorems such as the Corresponding Angles Theorem or the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, they may not recognize the importance of the transversal in these theorems."
681,"When drawing a cumulative frequency diagram, thinks you plot cumulative frequency on the horizontal axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the cumulative frequency should be plotted on the horizontal (x-axis) rather than the vertical (y-axis) of a cumulative frequency diagram. They may think that the horizontal axis represents the running total of frequencies, while the vertical axis represents the data values or class intervals.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to cumulative frequency diagrams and are not clear about the conventions for plotting the data.
- When students are used to plotting bar charts or histograms, where the frequency is often plotted on the vertical axis, but mistakenly apply this convention to cumulative frequency diagrams.
- When students misinterpret the concept of ""cumulative"" and think it refers to a horizontal accumulation of frequencies rather than a vertical accumulation.
- When students are working with a dataset and want to show the running total of frequencies, but mistakenly plot it on the horizontal axis instead of the vertical axis.
- When students are under time pressure or stress during an exam or assessment, and may plot the data incorrectly due to momentary confusion or lack of attention to detail."
682,Thinks millimetres and centimetres are the same,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the relationship between different units of measurement, specifically in the metric system. They may think that millimetres (mm) and centimetres (cm) are interchangeable terms, not realizing that they represent different scales of measurement. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly convert between units, misinterpret measurements, and make errors in calculations involving length and size.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading and interpreting scales on rulers or measuring tapes, students may think that the markings for mm and cm are equivalent.
- When completing measurement-based activities, such as measuring the length of objects, students may record measurements in mm but label them as cm, or vice versa.
- In real-world applications, such as building design or crafting, students may misunderstand the scale of measurements, leading to incorrect calculations and potentially costly mistakes.
- When solving problems involving unit conversions, students may incorrectly assume that 1 mm is equal to 1 cm, leading to incorrect answers.
- In science experiments, such as measuring the growth of plants, students may misrecord or misinterpret data due to their misunderstanding of the units of measurement."
683,"When factorising, believes they can choose different factors for each term","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorisation, particularly when dealing with expressions that involve multiple terms. They may believe that they can choose different factors for each term, as long as the product of the factors equals the original term. For example, when factorising an expression like 6x + 12, students may think that they can choose 2x as a factor for the first term (6x = 2x * 3) and 4 as a factor for the second term (12 = 4 * 3), resulting in an incorrect factorisation such as 2x(3) + 4(3). This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental principle of factorisation, which requires finding common factors that can be applied to all terms in the expression.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising expressions with multiple terms, such as 9x + 15 or 4x - 8.
- Dealing with expressions that have common factors, but not immediately apparent, like 12x + 18 or 24x - 30.
- When factorising quadratic expressions, such as x^2 + 5x + 6 or x^2 - 7x + 12."
684,Does not find a common denominator when comparing fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students compare fractions without finding a common denominator, often leading to incorrect conclusions. They may simply compare the numerators (the numbers on top) without considering the denominators (the numbers on the bottom), or they may compare the fractions as if they were whole numbers. This can lead to misunderstandings about the relative sizes of the fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing 1/4 and 1/6: A student might think 1/4 is smaller than 1/6 because 4 is smaller than 6.
- Comparing 3/8 and 2/4: A student might think 3/8 is larger than 2/4 because 3 is larger than 2, without realizing that the denominators are different.
- Comparing 5/12 and 3/4: A student might think 5/12 is larger than 3/4 because 5 is larger than 3, without finding a common denominator to compare the fractions accurately."
685,Does not adjust the hour for “to” times,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating time intervals or durations, particularly when dealing with ""to"" times. They may correctly calculate the difference in hours and minutes, but fail to adjust the hour for the ""to"" time, which indicates the end time of the interval. 

For example, if a task starts at 9:00 AM and lasts until 11:30 AM, a student with this misconception may correctly calculate the duration as 2 hours and 30 minutes, but when asked to give the time 2 hours and 30 minutes after 9:00 AM, they may respond with 11:00 AM plus 30 minutes (i.e., 11:30 AM), without realizing that the end time ""to"" 11:30 AM is already included in the given information.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. If a movie starts at 7:00 PM and lasts until 9:45 PM, how long did it last?
2. If a train journey takes 3 hours and 15 minutes from 10:00 AM to reach its destination, what time does it arrive?
3. A school event starts at 2:00 PM and ends at 4:30 PM. How long did the event last?"
686,Does not know units of area should be squared,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand that units of area are two-dimensional and therefore should be squared. They may think that the unit of area is the same as the unit of length. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and answers when dealing with area-related problems.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the area of a rectangle, a student may write the answer in units of length (e.g., 10 cm) instead of squared units (e.g., 10 cm²).
- When comparing areas of different shapes, a student may not consider the squared units, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- When solving real-world problems, such as calculating the area of a room or a garden, a student may not include the squared units, resulting in incorrect answers.
- When converting between different units of area, such as from square meters to square centimeters, a student may not apply the correct conversion factor due to their misunderstanding of squared units."
687,Confused mixed numbers with improper fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between mixed numbers and improper fractions. A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a fraction (e.g., 2 1/3), while an improper fraction is a fraction with a numerator greater than the denominator (e.g., 7/3). Students with this misconception may incorrectly convert between the two forms or incorrectly interpret the values of mixed numbers and improper fractions.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When adding or subtracting mixed numbers and improper fractions, students may incorrectly combine the whole number part with the fraction part.
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, students may forget to multiply the whole number by the denominator before adding the numerator.
- When comparing the values of mixed numbers and improper fractions, students may incorrectly assume that the mixed number is always smaller or larger than the improper fraction.
- When solving real-world problems involving fractions, such as measuring ingredients or dividing objects, students may incorrectly apply mixed numbers or improper fractions, leading to incorrect solutions."
688,Confuses the factorised form of repeated roots and the difference of 2 squares,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to distinguish between the factorised form of a quadratic expression with repeated roots and the difference of two squares. The factorised form of a quadratic expression with repeated roots typically has the form (x - a)(x - a) or (x - a)^2, while the difference of two squares has the form (x - a)(x + a) or x^2 - a^2.

In the case of repeated roots, students may incorrectly expand (x - a)^2 to x^2 - a^2 instead of the correct expansion x^2 - 2ax + a^2. Similarly, when factoring the difference of two squares, students may incorrectly write it as (x - a)^2 instead of (x - a)(x + a).

This misconception can lead to incorrect simplification, expansion, and factorisation of quadratic expressions, resulting in incorrect solutions to equations and algebraic manipulations.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

* When expanding (x - 3)^2, a student may incorrectly write it as x^2 - 9 instead of x^2 - 6x + 9.
* When factoring x^2 - 16, a student may incorrectly write it as (x - 4)^2 instead of (x - 4)(x + 4).
* When solving the equation x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0, a student may incorrectly factor it as (x - 2)(x + 2) instead of (x - 2)^2."
689,"When multiplying algebraic terms written in the same base, adds the base variables and multiplies the powers.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the rules of multiplying algebraic terms with the same base. They incorrectly assume that when multiplying terms, such as x^2 and x^3, they should add the base variables (x + x) and multiply the powers (2 * 3). This results in an incorrect expression, such as 2x^6 or x^6.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying x^2 and x^4, resulting in an incorrect expression, such as 2x^8 or x^8.
- Multiplying 2x and 3x^2, resulting in an incorrect expression, such as 5x^3 or 6x^3.
- Multiplying x and x^5, resulting in an incorrect expression, such as 2x^6 or x^6."
690,Struggles to visualise nets of 3D shapes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty in understanding and visualizing the 2D representation (nets) of 3D shapes. They may struggle to comprehend how a flat net can be folded to form a 3D object, leading to challenges in identifying the correct net for a given shape. This can be due to a lack of spatial awareness, difficulty in understanding the relationships between different parts of the shape, or an inability to think creatively about how the net can be folded and transformed into a 3D object.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify the correct net for a specific 3D shape, such as a cube or a pyramid.
- When students are required to draw or create the net of a 3D shape from a given description or image.
- When students need to calculate the surface area of a 3D shape using its net, but are unable to visualize the shape correctly.
- When students are asked to create a 3D shape from a given net, but struggle to understand how the different parts of the net fit together.
- When students are presented with a complex 3D shape, such as a prism or a polyhedron, and are unable to visualize its net due to the multiple faces and edges."
691,To find the range adds the biggest and smallest number rather than subtract,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of range in statistics. They may believe that to find the range, they need to add the largest and smallest numbers in a dataset, rather than subtracting the smallest number from the largest number. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definition of range, which is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the range of a set of exam scores, a student may add the highest and lowest scores instead of subtracting the lowest from the highest.
- When analyzing data on the heights of students in a class, a student may add the height of the tallest student to the height of the shortest student, rather than finding the difference between the two.
- When working with a dataset of temperatures, a student may add the highest and lowest temperatures instead of subtracting the lowest from the highest to find the range of temperatures."
692,Only uses two terms of a sequence to work out a term-to-term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that by looking at just two consecutive terms in a sequence, they can determine the rule that applies to the entire sequence. They might assume that the pattern or rule they see between these two terms is consistent throughout the sequence, without checking if this pattern holds true for other terms.

For example, consider the sequence: 2, 4, 7, 11, 16. If a student only looks at the first two terms (2 and 4), they might assume the rule is ""add 2"" to get the next term. However, this rule does not hold true for the rest of the sequence.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

1. Finding the next number in a sequence: Students might use only the last two terms to determine the next number, without considering the overall pattern.
2. Identifying the nth term of a sequence: Students might incorrectly assume the term-to-term rule based on two terms and apply it to find the nth term.
3. Solving sequence-based problems: Students might misinterpret the sequence and arrive at an incorrect solution due to their limited analysis of the sequence."
693,Does not divide to get a unitary amount before scaling up,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with problems that involve scaling up a quantity, but they fail to first find the unitary amount (i.e., the amount for one unit) before multiplying it by the desired factor. Instead, they may directly multiply the given quantity by the scaling factor, leading to incorrect results.

For example:

- Case 1: A recipe for 4 people requires 240g of flour. How much flour is needed for 6 people? A student with this misconception may directly multiply 240g by 1.5 (6/4), without first finding out how much flour is needed for one person.

- Case 2: A book costs $15 for 3 copies. How much will 5 copies cost? A student with this misconception may multiply $15 by 5/3, without first finding the cost of one book.

- Case 3: A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. How far will it travel in 6 hours? A student with this misconception may directly multiply 240 miles by 1.5 (6/4), without first finding out how far the car travels in one hour."
694,Confuses cubic and quadratic graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to distinguish between the characteristics of cubic and quadratic graphs. They may incorrectly identify or sketch the graphs, failing to recognize the distinct features of each type. Cubic graphs typically have a more complex shape with one or two turning points and can have one, two, or three real roots, whereas quadratic graphs have a parabolic shape with one turning point and two real roots (or one repeated root, or no real roots if the graph doesn't intersect the x-axis). Students with this misconception may misinterpret or misapply the rules for identifying and sketching these graphs, leading to incorrect conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the type of graph (cubic or quadratic) based on its equation, students may incorrectly classify a cubic equation (e.g., y = x^3) as quadratic or vice versa.
- When sketching graphs, students may draw a parabolic shape for a cubic equation or a cubic shape for a quadratic equation.
- When solving equations, students may apply quadratic formulas or methods to cubic equations, or vice versa, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When analyzing the roots of a graph, students may mistakenly expect a cubic graph to have two real roots or a quadratic graph to have three real roots.
- When interpreting real-world data, students may incorrectly model a situation with a cubic or quadratic graph, leading to incorrect conclusions or predictions."
695,Has found the area of a triangle rather than an area of a parallelogram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a parallelogram but instead, they apply the formula for the area of a triangle (A = 1/2 × base × height). This is likely because they are familiar with the formula for the area of a triangle and mistakenly assume it applies to all shapes with a base and height, or they may incorrectly identify the given shape as a triangle. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When the parallelogram is presented in a slanted or rotated orientation, making it difficult for students to recognize its properties.
- When the height of the parallelogram is not a side, and students struggle to identify it correctly.
- When the problem involves a rectangle or square, which are special cases of parallelograms, but students are not aware of this connection.
- When students are given a word problem that involves finding the area of a real-life object that is shaped like a parallelogram, but they incorrectly visualize it as a triangle.
- When students are working with composite shapes that include a parallelogram and other shapes, and they incorrectly apply the formula for the area of a triangle to the parallelogram component."
696,"In the middle of the total column or row of a two way table, adds the other totals (including overall total), rather than finding the difference","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with two-way tables, which are used to organize and analyze data. The students mistakenly believe that the middle value of the total column or row is the sum of the other totals, including the overall total. However, this approach is incorrect and can lead to inaccurate conclusions.

In reality, the middle value in the total column or row is often a missing value that needs to be calculated by finding the difference between the overall total and the sum of the other values in that column or row. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are working with frequency tables, such as analyzing the number of students who participate in different sports, and they need to find the number of students who participate in a particular sport.
- When students are analyzing data on the number of items sold in different categories, and they need to find the number of items sold in a specific category.
- When students are working with survey data, such as analyzing the number of people who responded to a survey, and they need to find the number of people who responded in a particular way."
697,Arithmetic error when multiplying by 7,"Explanation: A common misconception that students may have is making arithmetic errors when multiplying numbers by 7. This can be due to a lack of memorization of the multiplication table for 7 or relying on counting up or repeated addition, which can lead to inaccuracies. Additionally, some students might confuse the multiplication facts for 7 with those of 5 or 9, as these numbers have more straightforward multiplication patterns.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Multiplying single-digit numbers by 7, e.g., 7 x 3 or 7 x 9.
- Multiplying multi-digit numbers by 7, e.g., 14 x 7 or 35 x 7.
- Calculating the area or perimeter of shapes involving measurements that are multiples of 7.
- Real-world applications, such as calculating the total cost of items priced at multiples of 7 or determining the number of items in groups of 7."
698,Believes each number on a clock face represents 1 minute,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the numbers on a clock face and the units of time they represent. They may think that each number on the clock represents 1 minute, rather than understanding that each number represents 5 minutes (on an analog clock with 12 hours marked). This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and misunderstandings when telling time, especially when dealing with intervals of time.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to calculate the time elapsed between 3:00 and 5:00, the student may answer 120 minutes (2 hours x 60 minutes) instead of the correct answer, which would be based on an understanding of the clock face.
* When asked to set a clock to 9:45, the student may place the minute hand on the 9 and then count up 45 numbers, rather than understanding that each number represents 5 minutes.
* When solving a problem that involves scheduling events at specific times, the student may become confused and incorrectly calculate the time intervals between events."
699,"When “borrowing” during a subtraction problem, does not subtract one from the preceding digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing multi-digit subtraction and need to ""borrow"" from a preceding digit to complete the operation. The misconception is that the student will simply take the preceding digit as is, without reducing it by one, and then proceed to subtract. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of place value and how the borrowing process affects the preceding digits.

For example, in the problem 43 - 27, a student with this misconception may ""borrow"" from the tens column and write 13 - 7, without changing the 4 in the tens column to a 3. This would lead to an incorrect calculation.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Subtracting multi-digit numbers, such as 75 - 32
- Subtracting numbers with zeros, such as 100 - 57
- Performing word problems that involve subtraction, such as ""Tom has 150 pencils and gives 75 to his friend. How many pencils does Tom have left?"""
700,"When calculating missing side length from perimeter, gives the total missing length instead of dividing for one side.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the length of one side of a shape given its perimeter and the lengths of the other sides. Instead of dividing the remaining perimeter by the number of missing sides, students mistakenly give the total remaining length as the answer for one side. This indicates a lack of understanding of the concept of perimeter as the sum of all sides and the need to distribute the remaining length equally among the missing sides.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- A rectangle has a perimeter of 20cm, with one side measuring 5cm and the opposite side also measuring 5cm. Students may give the answer as 10cm for one of the remaining sides, instead of dividing 10cm by 2 to get the length of one side.
- A square has a perimeter of 24cm, with one side measuring 6cm. Students may give the answer as 12cm for one of the remaining sides, instead of dividing 12cm by 3 to get the length of one side.
- A triangle has a perimeter of 18cm, with two sides measuring 5cm and 6cm. Students may give the answer as 7cm for the third side, instead of checking if it's correct or not since it's a triangle and we have to check if the third side is less than the sum of the other two sides."
701,Does not know the meaning of vertically opposite,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to understand the concept of vertically opposite angles in geometry. They may struggle to identify or recognize that vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect, and that these angles are always equal in measure. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in solving problems involving angles and shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify vertically opposite angles in a diagram, students may point to adjacent angles or corresponding angles instead.
- When solving problems involving intersecting lines, students may not recognize that vertically opposite angles have the same measure, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When working with shapes such as quadrilaterals or polygons, students may not be able to identify vertically opposite angles, making it difficult to determine properties of the shape.
- When given a problem involving angles around a point, students may not understand that vertically opposite angles are equal, leading to incorrect answers.
- When asked to explain the properties of vertically opposite angles, students may provide incorrect definitions or descriptions."
702,When changing a number to standard form omits zero's of significance ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting numbers to standard form (also known as scientific notation). In standard form, a number is written as a product of a number between 1 and 10, and a power of 10. Students with this misconception tend to omit zeros that are significant figures in the original number, which can lead to inaccurate representations.

For example:

* The number 4000 written in standard form is often incorrectly written as 4 × 10^3, omitting the significant zeros, instead of 4.000 × 10^3 or 4.0 × 10^3 (depending on the context).
* The number 0.004 written in standard form is often incorrectly written as 4 × 10^-3, omitting the significant zeros, instead of 4.00 × 10^-3 or 4.0 × 10^-3 (depending on the context).
* The number 40,000 written in standard form is often incorrectly written as 4 × 10^4, omitting the significant zeros, instead of 4.0000 × 10^4 or 4.0 × 10^4 (depending on the context).

This misconception can lead to problems when working with calculations involving standard form, as the omission of significant zeros can affect the accuracy of the results."
703,"When adding or subtracting surds, just finds the largest square that goes into each number under the surd and adds or subtracts those rather than using the largest square to simplify the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. When adding or subtracting surds, students may incorrectly assume that they can simply find the largest square that goes into each number under the surd and add or subtract those values. This approach neglects the fact that surds need to be simplified using the largest perfect square that divides the number under the radical sign.

For example, when adding √20 and √45, students with this misconception may find the largest square that goes into 20 (4) and the largest square that goes into 45 (9), then add √4 and √9, resulting in 2 + 3 = 5. Similarly, when subtracting √48 from √75, they might find the largest square that goes into 48 (16) and the largest square that goes into 75 (25), then subtract √16 from √25, resulting in 4 - 5 = -1.

This misconception can lead to incorrect simplifications and calculations, and it's essential to address this misunderstanding to ensure students grasp the correct methods for working with surds. 

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* Adding √50 and √72: A student might find the largest square that goes into 50 (25) and the largest square that goes into 72 (36), then add √25 and √36.
* Subtracting √24 from √63: A student might find the largest square that goes into 24 (4) and the largest square that goes into 63 (9), then subtract √4 from √9.
* Simplifying √90 + √120: A student might find the largest square that goes into 90 (9) and the largest square that goes into 120 (16), then add √9 and √16."
704,Thinks there are 10cm in a metre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of the relationship between centimeters and meters. They may believe that 1 meter is equal to 10 centimeters, rather than 100 centimeters. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the metric system or a misinterpretation of the conversion between units.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When measuring lengths in the classroom, a student may think that a 1-meter ruler is equivalent to 10 centimeters.
- When solving problems involving unit conversions, a student may incorrectly convert meters to centimeters, resulting in an answer that is 10 times smaller than the correct answer.
- When comparing the lengths of objects, a student may think that an object that is 1 meter long is only slightly longer than an object that is 10 centimeters long, rather than 10 times longer."
705,"When describing the relationship shown on a scatter graphs, gets the effect on the dependent variable backwards","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students interpret the relationship between two variables on a scatter graph, but incorrectly identify the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. They may correctly identify the type of relationship (positive, negative, or none) but mistakenly describe how the dependent variable changes in response to changes in the independent variable.

For example:

- Case 1: On a scatter graph showing a positive relationship between the amount of fertilizer used and plant growth, a student may say that ""as plant growth increases, the amount of fertilizer used decreases"" (instead of the correct interpretation that as fertilizer use increases, plant growth increases).
- Case 2: On a scatter graph showing a negative relationship between the amount of exercise done and body fat percentage, a student may say that ""as body fat percentage increases, the amount of exercise done increases"" (instead of the correct interpretation that as exercise increases, body fat percentage decreases).
- Case 3: On a scatter graph showing a relationship between the temperature and the number of ice cream sales, a student may say that ""as ice cream sales increase, the temperature decreases"" (instead of the correct interpretation that as temperature increases, ice cream sales increase).

In each of these cases, the student is getting the effect on the dependent variable (plant growth, body fat percentage, ice cream sales) backwards, incorrectly describing how it changes in response to changes in the independent variable (fertilizer use, exercise, temperature)."
706,Carries out operations from right to left regardless of priority order,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students perform mathematical operations in the wrong order, neglecting the correct order of operations as per the BODMAS (Brackets, Orders, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction) rule. Instead of following this order, they incorrectly perform operations from right to left, which can lead to incorrect results.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- 3 × 2 + 12 ÷ 4 (Student may perform 12 ÷ 4 first, then 3 × 2, but from right to left, adding 3 and 2 first, then multiplying, showing a lack of understanding of the order of operations)
- 18 - 3 + 12 (Student may subtract 3 from 18 first and then add 12, but in the wrong order, performing addition first)
- 9 + 8 - 5 (Student may add 9 and 8 first but then perform subtraction from right to left, subtracting 8 from 5)"
707,Believes that fractions with the same denominator are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that as long as two fractions have the same denominator, they are equal. They fail to recognize the importance of the numerator in determining the value of a fraction. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly equate fractions that have the same denominator but different numerators.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Comparing 1/8 and 3/8: A student may think these fractions are equal because they have the same denominator (8), even though the numerators (1 and 3) are different.
- Equating 2/4 and 3/4: A student may believe these fractions are equal since they share the same denominator (4), disregarding the fact that the numerators (2 and 3) are not the same.
- Simplifying fractions: When simplifying fractions, students may make errors if they focus solely on the denominator and neglect the numerator. For example, they might incorrectly simplify 2/6 to 1/6, thinking that the denominators are the same, without properly adjusting the numerator."
708,Believes switching the x and y variables in a linear equation gives a perpendicular line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that simply switching the x and y variables in a linear equation will result in a new equation that represents a line perpendicular to the original line. They may think that this is a shortcut to finding perpendicular lines, without understanding the underlying relationship between the slopes of perpendicular lines.

For example, if the original equation is y = 2x + 1, a student with this misconception may believe that switching the x and y variables to get x = 2y + 1 will result in a perpendicular line. They may apply this incorrect method in various situations, such as:

- Case 1: Finding the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line. For instance, given the equation y = 3x - 2, they may switch the x and y variables to get x = 3y - 2, thinking that this new equation represents a perpendicular line.

- Case 2: Graphing a pair of perpendicular lines. A student may graph the original line, then switch the x and y variables to get a new equation, which they believe represents a perpendicular line. They may then graph this new line, expecting it to be perpendicular to the original line.

- Case 3: Solving problems involving perpendicular lines in real-world contexts. For example, if a problem requires finding the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line that passes through a specific point, a student with this misconception may incorrectly switch the x and y variables to get a new equation, leading to an incorrect solution."
709,Adds instead of subtracts when using an area model for multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using an area model, also known as an array model, to represent multiplication problems. In this model, students create a grid with rows and columns representing the factors of the multiplication problem. The misconception occurs when students mistakenly add the areas of the individual parts instead of understanding that the product is the total area of the entire grid.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying two numbers using an area model, a student may draw the correct grid but then add the areas of the individual parts instead of finding the total area. For example, when multiplying 3 x 4, they might draw 3 rows and 4 columns, but then add 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 instead of finding the total area of 12.
- When dealing with word problems that involve area, such as finding the area of a room, students may mistakenly add the lengths of the sides instead of multiplying them to find the total area.
- When using the area model to represent the distributive property of multiplication, students may add the partial products instead of combining them to find the total product."
710,Confuses factors and multiples,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between factors and multiples of a number. Factors are the numbers that divide a given number exactly without leaving a remainder, whereas multiples are the products of a given number and any integer. Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify factors as multiples or vice versa, leading to errors in mathematical calculations and problem-solving.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to list the factors of a number, a student may list its multiples instead. For example, when asked to list the factors of 6, a student may respond with 6, 12, 18, 24, etc., which are actually multiples of 6.
- When solving problems involving least common multiples (LCM) or greatest common factors (GCF), students may get confused and use factors instead of multiples or vice versa, leading to incorrect answers.
- In word problems, students may misinterpret the context and use factors when multiples are required or vice versa. For instance, if a problem asks for the number of groups of 4 that can be formed from 12 students, a student may incorrectly use factors to solve the problem instead of using multiples."
711,Believes you write the carried value in the number rather than adding it to the next place value column,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing addition or subtraction operations involving multi-digit numbers. They incorrectly assume that the carried value should be written as part of the original number, rather than adding it to the next place value column. This indicates a lack of understanding of the concept of place value and the role of carrying in arithmetic operations.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding two multi-digit numbers, such as 45 + 27, the student may write the carried value (1) as part of the original number (45) instead of adding it to the tens column.
- When subtracting one multi-digit number from another, such as 54 - 27, the student may write the carried value (1) as part of the original number (54) instead of subtracting it from the tens column.
- When performing arithmetic operations involving regrouping, such as 143 + 75, the student may write the carried value (1) as part of the original number (143) instead of adding it to the hundreds column."
712,Believes you can not take away a larger number from a smaller one,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to subtraction and they believe that it's not possible to subtract a larger number from a smaller one. They might think that subtraction only works when the first number is larger than the second number. This misconception is often due to the fact that in everyday life, we usually subtract smaller numbers from larger ones, and students might not be exposed to situations where they need to subtract larger numbers from smaller ones.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When a student is given a problem like 5 - 7, they might say it's not possible or doesn't make sense.
- Case 2: If a student is asked to solve a word problem like ""Tom has 3 pencils and he gives 5 pencils to his friend"", they might struggle to understand how to represent this situation mathematically.
- Case 3: When working with negative numbers, students might find it difficult to understand how to subtract a larger number from a smaller one, leading to confusion and errors in their calculations."
713,"When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives a different term, which is not the next","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a sequence, particularly when identifying a specific term. They may incorrectly assume that any term they find is the one requested, rather than understanding that each term has a specific position in the sequence. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the pattern or rule governing the sequence, or difficulty in applying it to find the required term.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the 10th term in the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., a student might give the next term they can think of (e.g., 14), without realizing it's actually the 5th term.
- In the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, ..., a student might be asked for the 6th term but provide the 4th term (8) because it's a number they're familiar with in the sequence.
- Given the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, ..., a student might incorrectly give the term 15 when asked for the 5th term, not recognizing that 15 is actually the 6th term in the sequence."
714,Uses the other part instead of total frequency as denominator for relative frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use the frequency of the other categories or parts instead of the total frequency or total number of observations as the denominator when calculating the relative frequency. Relative frequency is a measure of the proportion of a particular category or value in a dataset, and it is typically calculated by dividing the frequency of that category by the total frequency. However, students with this misconception may divide the frequency of a category by the frequency of another category or the sum of the frequencies of the other categories, leading to incorrect results.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. A student is asked to find the relative frequency of students who prefer pizza in a class where 15 students prefer pizza, 10 students prefer burgers, and 5 students prefer salads. Instead of dividing 15 by the total number of students (30), they divide 15 by the number of students who prefer burgers (10) or the number of students who prefer salads (5).

2. A student is analyzing a dataset of exam scores and wants to find the relative frequency of students who scored above 80. Instead of dividing the number of students who scored above 80 by the total number of students, they divide it by the number of students who scored below 80.

3. A student is creating a bar chart to display the relative frequencies of different colors of cars in a parking lot. Instead of using the total number of cars as the denominator, they use the number of cars of a different color as the denominator to calculate the relative frequency of each color."
715,Removes the common denominator when making equivalent algebraic fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with algebraic fractions and they need to make equivalent fractions. They may incorrectly remove the common denominator from the fractions, thinking that this is the correct way to simplify the expression. However, removing the common denominator without considering the numerator can lead to an incorrect equivalent fraction. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions and how to work with algebraic expressions.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- When simplifying expressions like (2x + 3)/(x + 1) and (3x + 3)/(x + 1), students may remove the (x + 1) denominator without considering the numerator.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with algebraic expressions, such as (2x + 1)/(x + 2) + (x + 3)/(x + 2), students may remove the (x + 2) denominator without making the necessary adjustments to the numerator.
- When working with rational expressions, such as (x^2 + 2x)/(x + 2) and (x^2 + 4x)/(x + 2), students may remove the (x + 2) denominator without factoring the numerator correctly."
716,Rounds a decimal instead of using a fraction in division,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dividing numbers and the result is a decimal or a fraction, but they tend to round the decimal to a whole number or a simpler decimal, instead of representing it as a fraction. This could be due to a lack of understanding of fractions or a preference for working with decimals. 

For example, when dividing 3 by 4, a student might write the answer as 0.75 instead of 3/4, or round it to 1. In more complex cases, such as dividing 5 by 7, the student might round the result to 0.7 instead of keeping it as 5/7. 

This misconception can lead to inaccurate results, especially when working with fractions in algebra or geometry. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Dividing 1 by 3 in a recipe to make 1/3 of the ingredients.
2. Calculating the area of a triangle with sides of 3m and 4m.
3. Finding the probability of an event that has a 3/7 chance of occurring.
4. Measuring ingredients for a recipe that requires 2/5 cup of flour.
5. Dividing a pizza among 5 friends, where each friend gets 1/5 of the pizza."
717,Believes the amount given is for the whole rather than a part,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly assume that a given quantity or amount refers to the entire object, set, or situation, rather than a portion or part of it. In other words, they fail to recognize that the given amount might be a fraction, percentage, or ratio of the whole, rather than the whole itself.

This misconception can manifest in various math topics, including fractions, decimals, percentages, and ratios. For instance, students might think that a given amount of money is the total cost, when in fact it's only a deposit or a partial payment. Similarly, they might believe that a certain quantity of ingredients is required for the entire recipe, when it's only needed for a specific component.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe calls for 1/4 cup of sugar, and a student thinks that's the total amount of sugar needed for the entire recipe, rather than just one part of it.
- A shirt is on sale for 25% off, and a student believes the sale price is the original price, rather than a discount on the original price.
- A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours, and a student thinks that's the total distance traveled, rather than the distance traveled per hour.
- A bag contains 12 red marbles and 8 blue marbles, and a student thinks that 12 is the total number of marbles, rather than just the number of red marbles."
718,Uses sin when tan is required,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with trigonometric ratios in right-angled triangles, particularly when trying to find the length of a side opposite a given angle. They mistakenly use the sine ratio (opposite side/hypotenuse) instead of the tangent ratio (opposite side/adjacent side) when the adjacent side is given and they are trying to find the length of the opposite side.

This misconception may occur due to a lack of understanding of the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent, or because students have memorized formulas without fully grasping their meanings.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the length of a building's shadow given the angle of elevation of the sun and the height of the building.
- Calculating the distance of a ship from a lighthouse given the angle of elevation of the lighthouse and the height of the lighthouse.
- Determining the length of a slope in a construction project given the angle of the slope and the horizontal distance.
- Finding the height of a tree given the angle of elevation and the distance from the tree."
719,Does not recognise feet (ft) as a unit of length,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are not familiar with or do not understand that 'feet' (ft) is a unit of measurement for length, primarily used in the Imperial system. They may be more accustomed to using metric units such as meters (m) or centimeters (cm) and may not recognize or know how to convert between these units and feet.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding real-world applications, such as measuring the height of a person, the length of a room, or the distance between objects, especially in contexts where feet are commonly used, such as in construction or sports.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When measuring the height of a person, e.g., ""I am 5 feet 6 inches tall.""
- When reading or giving instructions involving measurements in feet, e.g., ""The room is 12 feet long.""
- When comparing lengths or distances measured in different units, e.g., ""Is 3 meters longer than 10 feet?""
- When solving problems involving conversion between units, e.g., ""If a person is 6 feet tall, how tall are they in meters?""
- When interpreting scale drawings or diagrams that use feet as a unit of measurement."
720,Believes that 'less than' includes the number ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term 'less than' to be inclusive of the number that is being compared to. For example, if a question states ""list all the numbers less than 5"", a student with this misconception may include the number 5 in their answer. They may understand 'less than' to mean 'less than or equal to', rather than strictly less than.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When comparing numbers on a number line, a student may include the endpoint when looking for numbers less than a certain value.
- In inequalities, a student may incorrectly include the boundary value, for instance, thinking that the solution to x < 3 includes x = 3.
- In real-life scenarios, such as shopping, a student may think that a price 'less than $10' includes items priced exactly at $10."
721,Does not know what the symbol for equal lengths means,"Explanation: This misconception refers to the misunderstanding of the symbol used to denote equal lengths in geometry, which is often represented by one or more small lines or marks (≡ or = with a wavy line above) on the lines or segments being compared. Students may think it's just a random marking or decoration on diagrams, or perhaps they might confuse it with other symbols or markings. They might not understand that this symbol indicates that the lengths of the marked segments are equal in measure.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding geometric concepts such as congruent shapes, symmetries, and proof. It can also hinder students' ability to reason about and compare the lengths of different segments in various diagrams.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

- When students are given a diagram of two or more line segments with the equal lengths symbol and are asked to identify which segments are equal in length.
- When students are asked to draw their own diagrams to illustrate equal lengths and do not include the correct symbol.
- When students are presented with a proof or explanation involving equal lengths and are unable to understand the reasoning due to their misunderstanding of the symbol.
- When students are given a set of congruent shapes and are asked to identify the equal lengths, but are unable to do so because they do not recognize the symbol."
722,Thinks the fraction button finds the reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the fraction button on a calculator (often denoted by 1/x or a/b) automatically generates the reciprocal of a given number, rather than simply converting a decimal to a fraction or creating a fraction from two numbers. They may think that pressing this button will always flip the numerator and denominator, resulting in the reciprocal of the original value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student wants to find the reciprocal of 2 and presses the fraction button, expecting the result to be 1/2.
- Case 2: A student needs to calculate 1 divided by 4 and uses the fraction button, thinking it will give them the reciprocal of 4, which is 1/4.
- Case 3: A student tries to find the reciprocal of a decimal value, such as 0.5, and presses the fraction button, expecting the result to be 1/0.5 = 2, but actually gets 1/2."
723,Forgets you need a ruler to measure lengths,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overlook the importance of using a standardized measuring tool, specifically a ruler, to accurately measure lengths. They may assume that lengths can be estimated or measured using other objects or methods, leading to inaccurate results.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When measuring the length of a room or object without using a ruler, instead relying on pacing or other estimation methods.
- When drawing shapes or diagrams and labeling their dimensions without using a ruler to ensure accurate measurements.
- When comparing the lengths of two or more objects without using a ruler to obtain precise measurements.
- When solving problems involving perimeter, area, or volume, and neglecting to use a ruler to measure the dimensions of the shapes involved.
- When conducting experiments or investigations that require precise measurements, such as in science or engineering projects, and failing to use a ruler to collect accurate data."
724,Thinks the denominator in a combined probablity will be the same as the denominator in the probability of the first event.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the combined probability of two or more events. They mistakenly assume that the denominator (the total number of outcomes) for the combined probability is the same as the denominator for the probability of the first event. This is incorrect because the combined probability often requires considering multiple events with different sets of outcomes, which can change the total number of possible outcomes.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Tossing two coins and calculating the probability of getting heads on both coins, where the student assumes the denominator is 2 (the number of outcomes for one coin toss) instead of 4 (the number of outcomes for two coin tosses).
- Drawing two cards from a deck and calculating the probability of getting two specific cards, where the student assumes the denominator is 52 (the number of cards in the deck initially) instead of 51 (the number of cards remaining after the first draw).
- Rolling two dice and calculating the probability of getting a specific sum, where the student assumes the denominator is 6 (the number of outcomes for one die) instead of 36 (the number of outcomes for two dice)."
725,Does not know that angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware that the sum of the angles formed on a straight line is always 180 degrees. They may believe that the sum can be any value or may not have a specific relationship. This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding and working with angles in various geometric contexts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to find the missing angle in a diagram where two or more angles are shown on a straight line.
- When solving problems involving the angles formed by intersecting lines, such as finding the angle between two lines.
- When working with shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, where angles on a straight line are involved.
- When solving problems involving the exterior angles of polygons, which are often related to the angles on a straight line.
- When asked to prove or explain the relationship between angles on a straight line, and the student is unable to provide a correct justification."
726,Believes they can reverse a percentage increase or decrease by dividing by the decimal multiplier of the original change,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that reversing a percentage change is a simple matter of ""reversing"" the original multiplier. For example, if a price increases by 20%, they think that to ""undo"" this change, they can simply divide by 1.2 (the decimal equivalent of 120%). They may assume that this will restore the original value. 

This misconception can occur in various scenarios:

- Case 1: A shirt originally costs £80, and its price increases by 25%. To find the original price, the student may incorrectly divide the new price (£100) by 1.25, thinking that this will give them the original price of £80.
- Case 2: A bakery has a 15% discount on all its items. If a student wants to find the original price of a discounted item, they might try to reverse the discount by dividing the discounted price by 0.85 (the decimal equivalent of 85%).
- Case 3: A person's salary increases by 10%, and later they want to know their original salary. The student might mistakenly think that dividing the new salary by 1.1 will give them the original salary."
727,Gets their constants and coefficients the wrong way around when writing a formula from a given situation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to translate real-world situations into algebraic expressions. They may mistakenly swap the constant and coefficient values in the formula. The constant term is a value that remains unchanged, whereas the coefficient is a number that multiplies a variable. Students with this misconception may incorrectly assign the constant value to the coefficient and vice versa, leading to an incorrect formula.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Tom has been saving money for a new bike and already has £20. He plans to save £5 per week from his allowance. Students with this misconception may write the formula as 5x + 20 = y, where x is the number of weeks and y is the total amount of money, but then incorrectly swap the values to 20x + 5.
- Case 2: A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. Students may write the formula as 5x + 0 = y, where x is the number of books on each shelf and y is the total number of books, but then incorrectly swap the values to 8x + 5.
- Case 3: A bakery sells a total of 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell 30 more whole wheat loaves than white bread loaves, students may write the formula as x + (x+30) = 250, but then incorrectly swap the values to 30x + 250 or 250x + 30."
728,Confuses least and most,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of ""least"" and ""most"" in mathematical contexts, often leading to incorrect comparisons and ordering of numbers or quantities. They may mistakenly identify the larger number as the ""least"" or the smaller number as the ""most"". This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the vocabulary or from difficulties with number sense and comparison skills.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two or more numbers, students may incorrectly identify the larger number as the ""least"" (e.g., ""Which is the least, 5 or 10?"").
- When ordering a set of numbers from least to greatest, students may mistakenly place the larger numbers first (e.g., ordering the numbers 3, 6, 9, and 1 as 9, 6, 3, 1).
- In word problems, students may misinterpret the terms ""least"" and ""most"" (e.g., ""Tom has 5 pencils and Sarah has 10 pencils. Who has the least?"").
- When working with data and statistics, students may incorrectly identify the least or most frequent value in a dataset (e.g., ""What is the most common color in this bar chart?"").
- In measurement contexts, students may confuse the least and most when comparing lengths, weights, or capacities (e.g., ""Which container holds the least amount of water?"")."
729,"Thinks the sum of 2 numbers, each squared first, is the same as adding the two numbers and then squaring the total","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the order of operations and incorrectly apply the properties of exponents. They may believe that squaring two numbers individually and then adding them is equivalent to adding the numbers first and then squaring the result. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the distributive property and the concept that squaring is not a linear operation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions such as (a^2 + b^2) and (a + b)^2, students may think they are equal.
- When solving problems involving Pythagoras' theorem, students may incorrectly apply the formula by adding the lengths of the sides and then squaring, rather than squaring the lengths individually and then adding.
- In algebraic manipulations, students may simplify expressions incorrectly, such as (x + 3)^2, by adding x and 3 first and then squaring the result, rather than using the correct expansion (x^2 + 6x + 9)."
730,Ends up £1 out when dealing with change in money,"Explanation: This misconception often arises when students are calculating change from a transaction. They may correctly calculate the amount of change due, but then incorrectly count out the coins or notes, resulting in an error of £1. This can occur when students are dealing with multiple items of different prices and have to calculate the total cost, then subtract the amount paid from the total to find the change.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A student buys a toy for £5 and pays with a £10 note. They calculate the change as £5, but when counting out the coins, they give £4 or £6 instead.
- A student buys multiple items with different prices (e.g., £2, £3, and £4) and pays with a £20 note. They correctly calculate the total cost as £9, but then incorrectly calculate the change as £10 or £11 instead of £11.
- A student is asked to calculate the change from a £50 note for a purchase of £32 and calculates the change as £17, but then gives £18 or £16 instead."
731,Believes that the third vertex of a triangle will share coordinates with both of the other vertices,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the basic properties of a triangle in coordinate geometry. They might think that for a shape to be a triangle, the third vertex must have the same x-coordinate as one of the vertices and the same y-coordinate as the other vertex. This misunderstanding can lead them to incorrectly identify or create triangles on a coordinate plane.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When plotting a triangle on a graph and assuming the third vertex will share an x-coordinate with one point and a y-coordinate with the other.
- When solving problems involving finding the coordinates of the third vertex of a triangle, given the coordinates of two other vertices.
- When identifying whether a set of points on a coordinate plane form a triangle or not, and incorrectly excluding or including points that share coordinates with other vertices."
732,Finds the mean instead of the median,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the middle value of a dataset, but instead of arranging the values in order and finding the middle value (the median), they add up all the values and divide by the number of values (the mean). This shows a misunderstanding of the difference between the mean and median, and when each is used.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When the dataset contains outliers, and the student is asked to find a measure of central tendency that is not affected by the outlier.
- When the dataset is not normally distributed, and the student is asked to find a measure of central tendency that is more resistant to skewness.
- When the question specifically asks for the middle value of a dataset, and the student assumes that the mean is always the middle value.
- When the student is asked to compare the median of two datasets, but instead compares the means.
- When the dataset is presented in a frequency table or graph, and the student incorrectly calculates the median by using the formula for the mean."
733,"When dividing an integer by a fraction, thinks they can just multiply instead.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing by fractions and mistakenly believe that it's the same as multiplying by the fraction. They might think that dividing by 1/2 is the same as multiplying by 1/2, without realizing that the operation of division is different from multiplication. 

For example, if asked to divide 6 by 1/2, a student with this misconception may incorrectly calculate 6 * 1/2 = 3, rather than recognizing that 6 ÷ 1/2 is equivalent to 6 * 2 = 12.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Dividing a whole number by a fraction (e.g., 8 ÷ 3/4)
- Dividing a fraction by another fraction (e.g., 1/2 ÷ 3/4)
- Solving word problems that involve dividing by fractions (e.g., ""If you have 12 cookies and you want to put them in bags that hold 1/4 of a cookie, how many bags can you fill?"")"
734,Confuses square rooting and halving the number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that finding the square root of a number is equivalent to halving the number. They may think that taking the square root means dividing the number by 2, rather than finding a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, they might think that the square root of 16 is 8 (because 16 divided by 2 is 8), rather than 4 (because 4 multiplied by 4 is 16).

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When simplifying expressions, like √16, where students might write 8 instead of 4.
* When solving equations, like x^2 = 25, where students might think x is 12.5 (half of 25) rather than 5.
* When working with real-world problems, like finding the length of a side of a square with an area of 49 square units, where students might think the side length is 24.5 (half of 49) rather than 7."
735,"In ratio where total is given, treats that as one part without dividing","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are given a ratio problem where the total quantity is provided, but they fail to divide the total by the sum of the parts to find the value of one part. Instead, they incorrectly treat the total as one part of the ratio. 

For example, if a cake recipe requires a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour and a total of 5 cups is needed, students with this misconception might assume 2 cups is needed for sugar and 3 cups for flour, without realizing that 2 and 3 are parts of the ratio that need to be scaled up to make 5 cups in total.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- A recipe for making cookies requires a ratio of 1:2 of butter to sugar. If 9 cups of the mixture are needed, students may incorrectly assume 1 cup of butter and 2 cups of sugar are needed.
- A paint mixture requires a ratio of 3:5 of blue to red paint. If 8 cups of paint are needed, students may incorrectly assume 3 cups of blue paint and 5 cups of red paint are needed.
- A farmer has a ratio of 2:7 of wheat to oats. If he has 9 bags in total, students may incorrectly assume he has 2 bags of wheat and 7 bags of oats."
736,"When subtracting past zero, adds the absolute values and then writes the answer with a negative sign","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, resulting in a negative answer. They incorrectly assume that subtracting past zero means simply adding the absolute values of the two numbers and then placing a negative sign in front of the result. 

For example, when subtracting 8 from 3, students with this misconception might think: ""8 is bigger than 3, so I'll add 8 and 3, which equals 11, and since I'm subtracting, I'll put a negative sign in front of the 11."" They would then write the incorrect answer as -11.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- 5 - 9 = ? (Incorrect answer: -14)
- 2 - 7 = ? (Incorrect answer: -9)
- 1 - 4 = ? (Incorrect answer: -5)"
737,Thinks there are 30 minutes in a hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of time and its units. They may be familiar with the fact that a school class period or a television show often lasts 30 minutes or is divided into 30-minute segments, leading them to believe that there are 30 minutes in an hour. They might not fully grasp the relationship between minutes and hours, or they might not have a clear understanding of how time is divided into equal periods.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to calculate the duration of an event that lasts for multiple hours, and they calculate it as 30 minutes per hour.
- When they are asked to convert hours into minutes, and they consistently multiply the hours by 30 instead of 60.
- When students are solving word problems involving time, such as scheduling appointments or calculating travel time, and they apply the incorrect assumption of 30 minutes in an hour.
- When they are reading analog clocks and incorrectly assume that the hour hand moves 30 minutes at a time instead of the correct 60 minutes."
738,Believes there are 100cl in a millilitre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between millilitres (mL) and centilitres (cL or cl). They incorrectly believe that 1 millilitre is equivalent to 100 centilitres, which is not true. This error may be due to a misunderstanding of the metric system's prefixes, where ""milli-"" means one-thousandth and ""centi-"" means one-hundredth. Students with this misconception may struggle to accurately convert between units of measurement.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Converting 500mL to centilitres: A student with this misconception might answer 50,000cL instead of 50cL.
2. Measuring ingredients for a recipe: If a recipe calls for 250mL of water, a student with this misconception might measure out 25,000cL instead of 25cL.
3. Solving a problem involving unit conversions: A student might be asked to convert 2L to millilitres and then to centilitres. With this misconception, they would incorrectly calculate 2000mL as 200,000cL instead of 200cL."
739,Rounds to wrong degree of accuracy (decimal places rather than significant figures),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of rounding numbers to a specific degree of accuracy. They tend to focus on rounding to a fixed number of decimal places rather than significant figures. Significant figures are a way of expressing the precision of a measurement or calculation, whereas decimal places are simply the number of digits after the decimal point. 

For example, students may be asked to round the result of a calculation to 3 significant figures, but instead, they might round it to 3 decimal places, which could result in an incorrect answer. This misconception can lead to inaccurate results and a lack of understanding of the importance of precision in mathematical calculations.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Rounding the result of a measurement to 3 decimal places instead of 3 significant figures (e.g., 4.5678 meters rounded to 4.568 meters instead of 4.57 meters).
- Rounding the result of a calculation involving multiple operations to a fixed number of decimal places instead of significant figures (e.g., 12.4567 + 7.8901 = 20.3468, rounded to 20.35 instead of 20.3).
- Comparing the results of different calculations rounded to different numbers of decimal places instead of significant figures (e.g., comparing 10.2 meters and 10.23 meters as if they were equally precise)."
740,"Does not recognise that for a shape to be reflected it will be ""flipped""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental concept of reflection in geometry. They may think that a reflection is simply moving or rotating the shape, rather than flipping it over a line of symmetry. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect visualizations and transformations of shapes.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

* When asked to reflect a shape over a line, a student may simply translate the shape to the other side of the line without flipping it.
* When given a diagram of a shape with a line of symmetry, a student may not recognize that the reflected shape should be a mirror image of the original shape.
* When solving problems involving reflections in coordinate geometry, a student may incorrectly apply the transformation, resulting in an incorrect image of the original shape.
* When asked to identify the line of symmetry of a shape, a student may not realize that the line of symmetry is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting a point to its reflected image."
741,Includes too many possibilites when given an 'at least' question in probability,"Explanation: When dealing with ""at least"" questions in probability, students often mistakenly include too many possibilities, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the probability. This misconception arises from a misunderstanding of what ""at least"" means in the context of probability. Students may incorrectly assume that ""at least"" means they need to consider all possible outcomes, rather than just the specific outcomes that meet the condition.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When calculating the probability of rolling at least a 4 on a six-sided die, students may include the outcomes of rolling a 1, 2, or 3, which do not meet the condition.
* When determining the probability of drawing at least two hearts from a deck of cards, students may include the outcomes of drawing no hearts or only one heart, which do not meet the condition.
* When finding the probability of getting at least 3 heads in 5 coin tosses, students may include the outcomes of getting 0, 1, or 2 heads, which do not meet the condition."
742,Believes solving an inequality gives a single value as a solution,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to differentiate between solving equations and inequalities. They tend to apply the same thought process as they would with equations, assuming that there is only one possible solution to an inequality. They fail to recognize that inequalities often represent a range of values that satisfy a given condition. As a result, they may stop solving the inequality as soon as they isolate the variable, expecting a single value as the solution.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When solving linear inequalities like 2x + 3 > 5, students may solve for x and expect a single value, rather than a range of values.
- When graphing inequalities on a number line, students may mark a single point instead of shading a region to represent the solution set.
- When solving quadratic inequalities, students may find the roots of the quadratic equation and think that these are the only solutions, neglecting the intervals where the inequality is satisfied."
743,"When calculating the area of a rectilinear compound shape, calculates the are of the surrounding rectangle","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a rectilinear compound shape, which is a shape made up of multiple rectangles. Instead of breaking down the shape into its individual rectangular components and calculating the area of each, students mistakenly calculate the area of the larger rectangle that surrounds the entire shape. This results in an incorrect area, as the surrounding rectangle often includes empty spaces or ""gaps"" that are not part of the actual shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When a student is asked to find the area of an L-shaped room, they might calculate the area of the entire rectangular space that the L-shape fits into, rather than breaking it down into two separate rectangles.
* When a student is asked to find the area of a shape consisting of multiple connected rectangles, such as a T-shape or a U-shape, they might calculate the area of the surrounding rectangle that encompasses the entire shape, rather than calculating the areas of the individual rectangles.
* When a student is asked to find the area of a shape with a ""missing"" section, such as a rectangle with a smaller rectangle cut out of it, they might calculate the area of the larger rectangle, ignoring the missing section."
744,"When dividing a fraction by an integer, thinks they can just multiply instead","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer and mistakenly believe they can simply multiply the fraction by the integer, rather than following the correct procedure of inverting and multiplying. 

For instance, when dividing 1/2 by 3, students with this misconception might calculate 1/2 * 3 = 3/2, instead of inverting the integer (i.e., turning 3 into 1/3) and then multiplying, which would be the correct approach.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Dividing a fraction by a whole number in a word problem, e.g., ""Tom has 1/2 of a pizza and he wants to share it equally among 3 friends. How much will each friend get?""
- Simplifying complex fractions with integers in the denominator.
- Solving algebraic equations involving fractions and integers, e.g., (1/2) / 3 = x."
745,Confuses midpoint and distance between two points,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between two related but distinct concepts in coordinate geometry: finding the midpoint of a line segment and calculating the distance between two points. The midpoint refers to the point that divides a line segment into two equal parts, whereas the distance between two points refers to the length of the line segment connecting them.

Students may mistakenly apply the midpoint formula (which averages the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of two points) when trying to find the distance between two points, or vice versa, apply the distance formula (which calculates the length of the line segment using the Pythagorean theorem) when attempting to find the midpoint.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* Case 1: When asked to find the point halfway between two cities on a map, a student may incorrectly use the distance formula to calculate the length of the line segment instead of finding the midpoint.
* Case 2: When solving a problem that requires calculating the distance between two points on a coordinate plane, a student may mistakenly use the midpoint formula, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* Case 3: In a geometry problem, a student may be asked to find the length of a line segment within a shape, but incorrectly apply the midpoint formula, leading to an incorrect solution.
* Case 4: When working with real-world applications, such as designing a road or a bridge, students may confuse the midpoint and distance formulas, resulting in incorrect calculations and potentially costly errors."
746,Finds surface area when asked for volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the volume of a three-dimensional object but instead, they calculate the surface area. This indicates that the students are confusing the two concepts and are not fully understanding the difference between the amount of space inside a 3D object (volume) and the total area of its surface (surface area).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are given the dimensions of a rectangular prism and asked to find its volume, but they multiply the length and width (and sometimes height) to find the area of the individual faces and then add them up, instead of multiplying the length, width, and height to find the volume.
- When students are given a real-world problem, such as finding the volume of water that can fit in a tank, but they calculate the surface area of the tank instead.
- When students are working with different shapes, such as spheres or cones, and they use the formula for surface area instead of volume, or vice versa."
747,Believes scales on graphs must match on both axes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students assume that the scales on both the x-axis and y-axis of a graph must have the same unit length or the same numerical scale. They may believe that if one unit on the x-axis represents 10 units, then one unit on the y-axis must also represent 10 units. This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding and interpreting graphs, particularly when dealing with different units or scales.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When plotting data on a graph with different units for the x and y axes (e.g., time in hours on the x-axis and distance in kilometers on the y-axis).
- When creating a graph to compare two variables with different scales (e.g., temperature in degrees Celsius and humidity in percentage).
- When working with graphs that have different scales for the x and y axes, such as a graph showing the relationship between the cost of goods and the quantity sold.
- When interpreting graphs in real-world applications, such as science, economics, or finance, where different scales are often used to represent different variables."
748,"When finding the negative power of a negative power, assumes they can ignore one of the negatives","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with expressions that involve negative powers of negative numbers. For instance, when faced with an expression like (-2)^(-3), some students may incorrectly assume that the two negative signs cancel each other out, effectively ignoring one of the negatives. They might then proceed to calculate the expression as if it were 2^(-3) or (-2)^3, which would yield an incorrect result.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Simplifying expressions with negative powers, such as (-a)^(-b) or (-x)^(-y).
* Solving equations involving negative powers, like (-2)^(-x) = 1/4.
* Manipulating algebraic expressions with multiple negative signs, such as -(-x)^(-2) or (-3)^(-2) * (-2)^(-3).
* Working with exponential functions and negative bases, such as y = (-2)^(-x) or y = (-a)^(-x).
* Evaluating numerical expressions with negative powers, like (-4)^(-2) or (-5)^(-1)."
749,"When asked to subtract a fraction from a unit, removes the unit value from the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to subtract a fraction from a whole unit, but instead of performing the subtraction operation correctly, they mistakenly remove the unit value from the denominator of the fraction. This indicates a misunderstanding of the concept of fractions and the relationship between the numerator and the denominator. Students with this misconception may think that the unit is directly related to the denominator, and subtracting from the unit means subtracting from the denominator.

For example, if asked to calculate 1 - 1/4, a student with this misconception may write 1/3 as the answer, mistakenly removing the unit value (1) from the denominator (4). This shows a lack of understanding of how fractions represent parts of a whole and how to perform operations with fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting a fraction from 1, e.g., 1 - 1/2
- Subtracting a fraction from a whole number, e.g., 2 - 3/4
- Subtracting a fraction from a mixed number, e.g., 2 1/2 - 1/4
- Word problems involving subtracting fractions from whole quantities, e.g., ""Tom has 1 pizza and eats 1/4 of it. How much pizza is left?"""
750,"When using the capture-recapture method, confuses the order of the calculation to find best estimate of population","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the sequence of steps involved in calculating the best estimate of a population using the capture-recapture method. They may mistakenly swap the order of the calculations, such as incorrectly dividing or multiplying the numbers, which leads to an incorrect estimate of the population size.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the number of animals in a particular area, a student may mistakenly divide the total number of animals caught in the first capture by the number of animals recaptured, instead of the other way around.
- In a scenario where a student is estimating the number of fish in a pond, they might incorrectly multiply the number of fish caught in the first capture by the total number of fish caught in the second capture, instead of using the correct formula.
- When analyzing the results of a capture-recapture experiment, a student may incorrectly subtract the number of animals recaptured from the total number of animals caught in the first capture, instead of using the correct formula to estimate the population size."
751,Believes you add the terms together when multiplying like terms.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying like terms in algebra. They incorrectly believe that when multiplying terms with the same variable, they should add the terms together instead of multiplying the coefficients. This shows a lack of understanding of the distributive property and the concept of combining like terms.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When multiplying 2x and 3x, students may think the answer is 2x + 3x = 5x instead of multiplying the coefficients 2 and 3 to get 6x.
- When multiplying x and 4x, students may think the answer is x + 4x = 5x instead of multiplying the coefficients 1 and 4 to get 4x.
- When multiplying 3y and 2y, students may think the answer is 3y + 2y = 5y instead of multiplying the coefficients 3 and 2 to get 6y."
752,Thinks that when dividing numbers in standard form you subtract the number and divide the power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of standard form (also known as scientific notation) and are required to perform division operations on numbers expressed in this form. They mistakenly believe that to divide numbers in standard form, they simply subtract the numbers (or coefficients) and divide the powers (or exponents) of 10. 

This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the rules for multiplying numbers in standard form, where the coefficients are multiplied and the exponents are added. Students may incorrectly apply a similar logic to division, thinking that the opposite operation of multiplication would involve subtraction and division.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When dividing two numbers in standard form, such as (2 × 10^3) ÷ (4 × 10^2). A student with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the result as (2 - 4) × 10^(3 ÷ 2).
- Case 2: When simplifying an expression like (6 × 10^4) ÷ (2 × 10^3). The student may mistakenly apply the incorrect rule, resulting in an answer of (6 - 2) × 10^(4 ÷ 3).
- Case 3: When solving a problem involving real-world applications, such as calculating the ratio of two very large or very small quantities expressed in standard form. For instance, if a problem involves dividing the number of atoms in two different substances, a student with this misconception may arrive at an incorrect answer by subtracting the coefficients and dividing the exponents."
753,Believes when you plot a linear sequence it doesn't give a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of linear sequences and how they can be represented graphically. They may believe that a linear sequence, which is a sequence of numbers in which each term increases or decreases by a constant difference, does not produce a straight line when plotted on a graph. This misconception may stem from a lack of experience in plotting linear sequences or a misunderstanding of the relationship between the sequence and its graphical representation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When plotting a linear sequence with a large or complex common difference, students may believe that the resulting graph will be curved or irregular, rather than a straight line.
* When dealing with sequences that involve negative numbers or fractions, students may become confused and think that the sequence will not produce a straight line when plotted.
* When graphing a linear sequence using a small or uneven scale, students may misinterpret the resulting graph and believe that it is not a straight line.
* When comparing the graphs of different linear sequences, students may mistakenly think that only certain sequences produce straight lines, while others do not.
* When working with real-world examples, such as the cost of goods or the distance traveled, students may not recognize that the underlying sequence is linear and can be represented by a straight line."
754,Does not recognise that an integer multiplied by a surd can be simplified,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that an integer multiplied by a surd can be simplified by factoring out perfect squares. Students may believe that the product of an integer and a surd is always an unsimplifiable expression, leading to incorrect simplifications and potentially incorrect solutions.

For example, students may struggle with the following cases:

- Simplifying expressions like 4√8, where they may not recognize that 8 can be factored as 4 × 2, leading to the simplified form 8√2.
- Simplifying expressions like 6√12, where they may not recognize that 12 can be factored as 4 × 3, leading to the simplified form 12√3.
- Simplifying expressions like 9√18, where they may not recognize that 18 can be factored as 9 × 2, leading to the simplified form 9√2.
- Simplifying expressions like 8√24, where they may not recognize that 24 can be factored as 4 × 6, and further simplified to 8 × 3, leading to the simplified form 8√6 and finally 4√6 * √2*2 or 16√6."
755,Does not know which letters can be subtracted in Roman Numerals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware of the rules governing the subtraction of Roman numerals. In Roman numerals, certain letters can be subtracted from others to represent smaller numbers, but not all letters can be subtracted. For example, students might think that they can subtract any letter from another, which is not the case. They may not understand that only specific combinations, such as IV (4) or IX (9), are valid, and attempting to subtract other letters would result in an incorrect representation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When writing the Roman numeral for 4, students might write IIII instead of IV.
- When writing the Roman numeral for 9, students might write VIIII instead of IX.
- When subtracting Roman numerals, such as 5 (V) minus 1 (I), students might write V - I = IIII instead of IV.
- When representing numbers like 40 or 90, students might write XXXX or LXXXX instead of XL or XC."
756,Believes unit fractions with a difference of 1 in the denominator have no other fractions between them,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of fractions, particularly unit fractions. They tend to believe that when two unit fractions have denominators that differ by 1 (e.g., 1/3 and 1/4), there are no other fractions between them. This is likely due to their familiarity with whole numbers, where consecutive integers have no other integers between them.

Students with this misconception may struggle to comprehend the concept of equivalent ratios and the density of fractions, leading them to believe that fractions with denominators that differ by 1 are always adjacent to each other.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the size of fractions, such as 1/3 and 1/4, students may insist that there are no other fractions between them.
- When asked to find a fraction between 1/5 and 1/6, students may claim that it is impossible or that there are no fractions between these two values.
- When ordering fractions, students may incorrectly place fractions with denominators that differ by 1 next to each other, without considering the possibility of other fractions between them."
757,Adds rather than multiplies when asked for a product,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of multiplication and instead use addition to solve problems that require finding a product. Students may interpret the multiplication symbol (×) as a sign to add a number a certain number of times, but in a wrong way, resulting in them adding the numbers together instead of multiplying them.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A bookshelf has 4 shelves, and each shelf can hold 5 books. If the student is asked how many books the bookshelf can hold in total, they may answer 4 + 5 = 9 instead of 4 × 5 = 20.
- A toy car track is 3 blocks long, and a student wants to make 6 identical tracks. When asked how many blocks they need in total, they may answer 3 + 6 = 9 instead of 3 × 6 = 18.
- A bakery sells 2 rows of cupcakes with 8 cupcakes in each row. If a student is asked how many cupcakes there are in total, they may answer 2 + 8 = 10 instead of 2 × 8 = 16."
758,Believes an outlier is a value that does not fit the same characteristics as the other values,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of an outlier in data analysis. They believe that an outlier is simply a value that is different or unique compared to the other values in the dataset, often focusing on non-numerical characteristics. For example, if a dataset consists of exam scores from students of different nationalities, a student might think that a score from a student of a different nationality is an outlier simply because it's from a different group, regardless of the actual score value. This misconception leads students to incorrectly identify outliers based on superficial differences rather than the actual statistical analysis.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Analyzing the favorite colors of students in a class, a student might think that a unique color choice (e.g., purple) is an outlier simply because no one else chose that color.
- Case 2: Examining the heights of students in different sports teams, a student might believe that a height value is an outlier because it belongs to a student from a different team or sport.
- Case 3: Looking at test scores from students of different age groups, a student might incorrectly identify a score as an outlier just because it's from a student in a different age group."
759,Confuses a formula with an expression,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a formula, which is a general rule or equation that describes a relationship, and an expression, which is a collection of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations combined but not equal to anything. Students with this misconception may think that any group of mathematical symbols constitutes a formula, without understanding that a formula must have an equal sign (=) and express a specific relationship.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying or manipulating equations, students may treat expressions and formulas as interchangeable.
- In word problems, students might incorrectly identify a given expression as a formula or vice versa.
- When solving equations, students with this misconception may not understand that they are working towards isolating a variable on one side of the equation.
- In algebraic manipulations, students might not recognize the importance of maintaining the equality sign when working with formulas.
- When graphing functions, students may confuse the function's equation (a formula) with an expression representing a specific point on the graph."
760,Converts a fraction to a decimal by using the denominator after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a decimal involves simply placing the denominator after the decimal point, without actually performing the division. For example, they may think that 3/4 can be converted to a decimal by writing 3.4, where the denominator '4' is placed after the decimal point. Similarly, they may think that 2/5 can be converted to 2.5, or 1/8 can be converted to 1.8.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* Converting simple fractions like 1/2, where students might write 1.2 instead of 0.5
* Converting fractions with larger denominators, like 3/10, where students might write 3.10 instead of 0.3
* Converting mixed numbers, like 2 1/4, where students might write 2.4 instead of 2.25
* Solving real-world problems involving fractions and decimals, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or calculating the cost of items."
761,Subtracts instead of adds when finding a midpoint,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the midpoint of a line segment or an interval, they need to subtract the two values instead of adding them and then dividing by 2. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of midpoints or from a misunderstanding of the formula for finding midpoints.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

* Case 1: Finding the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (2, 3) and (6, 7). A student with this misconception may subtract the x-coordinates (6 - 2 = 4) and the y-coordinates (7 - 3 = 4) instead of adding them and dividing by 2.
* Case 2: Finding the midpoint of the interval [5, 11]. A student with this misconception may subtract the two values (11 - 5 = 6) and then divide by 2, instead of adding them (5 + 11 = 16) and dividing by 2.
* Case 3: Solving a problem that involves finding the midpoint of a range of values, such as finding the midpoint of the scores 25 and 75. A student with this misconception may subtract the two values (75 - 25 = 50) instead of adding them (25 + 75 = 100) and dividing by 2."
762,Chooses an example when asked for a counter-example,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to provide a counter-example to a statement, but instead, they provide an example that supports the statement. A counter-example is an instance that contradicts or disproves a statement, whereas an example is an instance that supports or illustrates a statement. Students with this misconception may struggle to think of a scenario that challenges the given statement and instead, provide an example that reinforces it.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- In Number, when asked to find a number that is not a multiple of 3, a student might give the example of 6, which is actually a multiple of 3.
- In Algebra, when asked to find a value of x that does not satisfy the equation 2x + 3 = 5, a student might give the example of x = 1, which actually satisfies the equation.
- In Data and Statistics, when asked to find a data point that does not fit the trend of a graph, a student might give the example of a data point that is consistent with the trend.
- In Geometry, when asked to find a shape that does not have four right angles, a student might give the example of a rectangle, which actually has four right angles.
- In Measure, when asked to find a unit of measurement that is not a standard unit of length, a student might give the example of meters, which is actually a standard unit of length."
763,Believes 'inclusive' does not include the end value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with number ranges or intervals, particularly when the terms 'inclusive' and 'exclusive' are used. They mistakenly believe that when a range is specified as 'inclusive', the end value is not part of the range. For example, if a question states ""find all numbers between 1 and 10 inclusive"", students with this misconception may exclude the value 10 from their answer, thinking it's not part of the range.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When working with number lines and identifying points within a certain range.
* When solving inequalities, where students may incorrectly exclude the end value from the solution set.
* When dealing with real-world applications, such as finding the number of days within a specific date range, where including or excluding the end date can make a difference.
* When interpreting data in statistics, where inclusive and exclusive ranges can affect the results and conclusions drawn.
* When solving problems involving intervals in algebra, where the inclusion or exclusion of the end value can change the solution set."
764,Confuses octagon and pentagon,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty in identifying and differentiating between an octagon and a pentagon. An octagon is an eight-sided polygon, while a pentagon is a five-sided polygon. Students may struggle to recognize the distinct number of sides in each shape, leading to incorrect identification. This misconception can stem from a lack of exposure to various geometric shapes, insufficient practice in counting sides, or difficulties with visual-spatial skills.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify a shape with eight sides, a student might incorrectly label it as a pentagon.
- When tasked with drawing a pentagon, a student may inadvertently draw an octagon or vice versa.
- In a multiple-choice question, a student may choose the wrong option when asked to identify the shape with a specific number of sides.
- During a geometry lesson, a student may confuse the properties and characteristics of octagons and pentagons, such as their internal angles or number of diagonals.
- When solving problems involving perimeter or area calculations, a student's misconception may lead to incorrect calculations due to the incorrect number of sides used in the formula."
765,Thinks there are 10kg in a tonne,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 10 kilograms in a tonne, likely due to a misunderstanding or misremembering of the actual conversion factor. A tonne is a unit of mass, and students may have difficulty understanding the relationship between tonnes and kilograms. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conversions when dealing with large masses.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When converting a large mass from tonnes to kilograms, a student may multiply by 10 instead of 1,000, resulting in an incorrect answer.
2. When comparing the masses of objects in tonnes and kilograms, a student may incorrectly assume that 1 tonne is equal to 10 kilograms, leading to incorrect comparisons.
3. When solving problems involving masses in tonnes and kilograms, a student may apply the incorrect conversion factor, leading to incorrect solutions.
4. When reading or interpreting data that involves masses in tonnes and kilograms, a student may misinterpret the information due to their misconception about the conversion factor."
766,Confuses the graphs of  direct and inverse proportion,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the graphical representations of direct and inverse proportion relationships. In direct proportion, as one variable increases, the other variable also increases at a constant rate, resulting in a straight line passing through the origin. On the other hand, in inverse proportion, as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, resulting in a hyperbola. 

Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify or draw the graphs of direct and inverse proportion relationships, often swapping the two or drawing a straight line for an inverse proportion. They might also fail to recognize the distinct characteristics of each type of graph, such as the straight line passing through the origin for direct proportion and the asymptotes of the hyperbola in inverse proportion.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Case 1: Graphing the relationship between the cost of goods and the number of items purchased, where students incorrectly draw a hyperbola for a direct proportion relationship.
- Case 2: Analyzing the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas, where students mistakenly draw a straight line for an inverse proportion relationship.
- Case 3: Interpreting the relationship between the speed of a car and the time taken to travel a certain distance, where students incorrectly identify a direct proportion relationship as an inverse proportion.
- Case 4: Solving problems involving the relationship between the amount of a substance and its concentration, where students incorrectly apply the concept of direct proportion to an inverse proportion scenario."
767,Thinks there are 10 minutes in an hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of time and its units. They may be familiar with the number 10 being a common base in mathematics, such as the decimal system, and mistakenly apply this understanding to time, thinking there are 10 minutes in an hour. They may also struggle to comprehend the relationship between hours and minutes, failing to grasp that there are actually 60 minutes in an hour.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to calculate elapsed time, they might respond with answers like ""it took 5 hours and 8 tens of minutes.""
- When asked to convert hours to minutes, they may multiply the number of hours by 10 instead of 60.
- When solving problems involving time, they may consistently make errors due to their misunderstanding of the number of minutes in an hour."
768,Finds the circumference of the whole circle instead of arc length ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the length of an arc of a circle, but they mistakenly calculate the circumference of the entire circle instead. The students understand the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr), but they fail to recognize that the arc length is a fraction of the total circumference, depending on the central angle subtended by the arc. As a result, they calculate the entire circumference, ignoring the fact that the arc only covers a portion of the circle.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to find the length of an arc that subtends a central angle of 60° in a circle with a radius of 4 cm. Instead of finding the fraction of the circumference covered by the arc, they calculate the entire circumference (C = 2π(4) = 8π cm).
- In a geometry problem, a student is required to find the length of a semicircular arc with a radius of 3 cm. Instead of finding half the circumference, they calculate the entire circumference (C = 2π(3) = 6π cm).
- A student is asked to compare the lengths of two arcs in different circles. They calculate the entire circumference of each circle instead of finding the arc lengths, leading to incorrect comparisons."
769,Confuses the direction of vectors when adding or subtracting,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the concept of vector addition and subtraction, specifically the direction of the resulting vector. When adding or subtracting vectors, students often mistakenly assume that the direction of the resulting vector is the same as one of the original vectors, or that the direction is simply the sum of the individual directions. They may fail to recognize that the direction of the resulting vector depends on both the magnitude and direction of the individual vectors.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and representations of vector operations, particularly when dealing with graphical representations or real-world applications.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When adding two vectors that are not in the same direction, students may draw the resulting vector in the same direction as one of the original vectors, rather than using the parallelogram method to find the correct direction.
2. When subtracting one vector from another, students may assume that the resulting vector has the same direction as the first vector, rather than understanding that the resulting vector points in the opposite direction of the second vector.
3. In problems involving relative motion, students may incorrectly determine the direction of an object's velocity or displacement by adding or subtracting vectors without considering the directions of the individual vectors."
770,Believes class width represents area of the bar in a histogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the width of a class or bin in a histogram represents the area of the bar, rather than just the range of values within that class. They may think that a wider class width means a larger area of the bar, and therefore, a greater frequency or quantity of data. However, in reality, the area of the bar is determined by both the width of the class and the height of the bar (which represents the frequency or density of the data within that class).

This misconception can lead students to misinterpret the data presented in the histogram, potentially drawing incorrect conclusions about the distribution of the data.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When comparing the areas of two bars in a histogram with different class widths, a student may incorrectly assume that the bar with the wider class width has a greater area and therefore more data, without considering the height of the bar.
- When constructing their own histograms, students may intentionally use wider class widths to make certain bars appear larger, not realizing that this does not accurately represent the data.
- When interpreting a histogram with varying class widths, students may incorrectly conclude that a particular class has a higher frequency or quantity of data simply because it has a wider class width, without considering the actual height of the bar."
771,Believes that the solutions to x<b or x>b also satisfy ax<b or ax>b,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the impact of the coefficient 'a' on the inequality. They assume that if x is less than or greater than b, then multiplying or dividing both sides by any number 'a' will not affect the direction of the inequality. However, this is not true when 'a' is negative, as it will flip the direction of the inequality. Students with this misconception will incorrectly apply the same logic for both positive and negative coefficients, leading to incorrect conclusions.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Case: Solve the inequality -2x > 6. Student response: x > -3 (instead of x < -3).
2. Case: Solve the inequality x < 5. Then solve 3x < 15 and -3x < 15. Student response: same solution for both inequalities, x < 5.
3. Case: Given the inequality -x > 2, find the values of x that satisfy it. Student response: x > -2 (instead of x < -2).
4. Case: Compare the solutions of x > 2 and -2x > 4. Student response: same solution for both inequalities, x > 2."
772,Rotates instead of reflects,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a shape or object over a line of symmetry or reflection axis means rotating it, rather than creating a mirror image on the opposite side. They may think that the reflected image should be a rotated version of the original shape, rather than a flipped version. This misconception can lead to incorrect drawings or descriptions of reflected shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to reflect a shape over a horizontal or vertical line, a student may draw a rotated version of the shape instead of a reflected one.
- When working with mirror lines, a student may confuse reflection with rotation and draw a shape that has been rotated by 180 degrees instead of reflected.
- In a geometry problem, a student may be given a shape and asked to reflect it over a specific line, but they may draw a shape that has been rotated instead of reflected, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In a graphing problem, a student may be asked to reflect a function over the x-axis or y-axis, but they may mistakenly rotate the graph instead of reflecting it."
773,Does not understand to find each interior angle of a regular polygon you divide the sum by the number of sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the measure of each interior angle of a regular polygon. They may understand that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be found using a formula (e.g., (n-2) * 180 degrees), but they fail to realize that to find the measure of each individual interior angle, they need to divide the sum by the number of sides (n) of the polygon.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations, where students may provide the sum of the interior angles as the answer, rather than the measure of each individual angle.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- When finding the interior angle of an equilateral triangle, a student may calculate the sum of the interior angles as 180 degrees, but fail to divide by 3 to find the measure of each angle.
- When asked to find the interior angle of a regular hexagon, a student may calculate the sum of the interior angles as 720 degrees, but fail to divide by 6 to find the measure of each angle.
- When solving a problem involving a regular octagon, a student may calculate the sum of the interior angles as 1080 degrees, but fail to divide by 8 to find the measure of each angle."
774,"When subtracting mixed numbers, does not realise that a negative fractional answer needs to be taken away from their integer answer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are subtracting mixed numbers, which are numbers that consist of both whole numbers and fractions. When performing the subtraction, students may correctly calculate the whole number part and the fractional part separately, but they fail to recognize that a negative fractional answer should be subtracted from the whole number part. This results in an incorrect answer, as they are not taking into account the effect of the negative fraction on the overall value.

For example, consider the following cases:

- Case 1: 5 1/2 - 3 3/4. A student with this misconception may calculate the whole number part as 5 - 3 = 2 and the fractional part as 1/2 - 3/4, resulting in a negative fraction (-1/4). However, they may write the answer as 2 1/4, instead of 1 3/4.
- Case 2: 7 3/4 - 4 1/2. A student with this misconception may calculate the whole number part as 7 - 4 = 3 and the fractional part as 3/4 - 1/2, resulting in a positive fraction (1/4). However, if the calculation resulted in a negative fraction, they would make the same mistake.
- Case 3: 9 1/4 - 6 3/4. A student with this misconception may calculate the whole number part as 9 - 6 = 3 and the fractional part as 1/4 - 3/4, resulting in a negative fraction (-1/2). Again, they may fail to subtract this negative fraction from the whole number part, resulting in an incorrect answer."
775,"When adding variables with powers, thinks they can add the powers","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to adding variables with powers, but they incorrectly apply the rule for multiplying variables with powers. They mistakenly believe that when adding variables with the same base, they can simply add the exponents. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and the difference between addition and multiplication when working with variables.

Examples of cases when this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A student is given the expression 2x^2 + 3x^2 and incorrectly simplifies it to 5x^4, thinking that they can add the powers.
* Case 2: A student is given the expression x^3 + x^2 and incorrectly simplifies it to x^5, thinking that they can add the powers.
* Case 3: A student is given the expression 4x^2 + 2x^3 and incorrectly simplifies it to 6x^5, thinking that they can add the powers."
776,Does not know how to compare size of angles on a grid without a protractor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to determine the size of angles on a grid without relying on a protractor. They may struggle to visually compare the size of angles, especially if they are not familiar with the properties of angles, such as acute, obtuse, and right angles. This can lead to difficulties in determining which angle is larger or smaller when comparing two or more angles.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When two angles are presented on a grid and students are asked to determine which one is larger without using a protractor.
* When students are asked to identify acute, obtuse, or right angles on a grid and they are not able to recognize the characteristics of these angles.
* When students are asked to compare the size of angles in real-world scenarios, such as the angle of a roof or the angle of a ramp, and they are not able to apply their knowledge of angles to make the comparison.
* When students are presented with angles that are rotated or reflected on a grid and they are not able to recognize that the size of the angle remains the same.
* When students are asked to solve problems involving angles on a grid, such as finding the missing angle in a triangle or determining the sum of interior angles in a polygon."
777,"When describing the relationship between the parts in a ratio using a fraction, gets the numerator and denominator the opposite way around","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to express a ratio as a fraction and they incorrectly identify which part of the ratio should be the numerator and which part should be the denominator. For example, if a ratio is 3 parts of one item to 4 parts of another, students with this misconception may write the fraction as 4/3 instead of 3/4.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When comparing the number of boys to girls in a class, students may write the ratio of boys to girls as a fraction with the number of girls in the numerator and the number of boys in the denominator, or vice versa.
- When following a recipe that requires a ratio of ingredients, such as 2 parts flour to 3 parts sugar, students may write the fraction as 3/2 instead of 2/3, which could result in incorrect proportions of ingredients.
- When analyzing the ratio of one shape to another in geometry, such as the ratio of the number of triangles to the number of squares in a pattern, students may incorrectly write the fraction, leading to misunderstandings about the relationship between the shapes."
778,Struggles to visualise the new position of an object after transformations,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty in mentally visualizing or understanding how an object changes its position or shape after undergoing transformations such as translations, rotations, and reflections. They may struggle to comprehend how the object's coordinates, orientation, or size change in response to these transformations, often leading to incorrect predictions or drawings of the transformed object.

This misconception can occur in various cases, including:

- When asked to describe or draw the new position of a shape after a series of transformations, such as ""Translate the triangle 3 units to the right and then rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.""
- When trying to understand the effect of a transformation on the coordinates of a point, for example, ""What are the new coordinates of point A after a reflection across the x-axis?""
- When solving problems involving the composition of transformations, such as ""What is the result of rotating a square 180 degrees and then translating it 2 units up?""
- When working with real-world applications of transformations, like designing a pattern or tiling, and struggling to visualize how the individual elements will change after transformations.
- When interpreting and working with graphs or charts that involve transformations, such as understanding the effect of a translation on the graph of a function."
779,"When multiplying multiples of ten and the answer requires an extra digit, leaves off that extra digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying multiples of ten, such as 10, 100, or 1000, by another number. When the product requires an additional digit, some students tend to omit that extra digit, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect answer. This error often occurs due to a lack of understanding of the place value system and how numbers change when multiplied by multiples of ten.

Examples of when this misconception may occur:

- 50 × 6 = ?, student answers 300 instead of 3000 (leaving off the extra digit '0').
- 200 × 4 = ?, student answers 800 instead of 8000 (leaving off the extra digit '0').
- 400 × 5 = ?, student answers 2000 instead of 20000 (leaving off the extra digit '0')."
780,Believes the constant only gives the y-intercept for linear graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the constant term in a linear equation (often represented as 'c' in the equation y = mx + c) only represents the y-intercept of the graph, without understanding its broader implications on the entire graph. They might think that changing the constant term only shifts the starting point of the line (where it crosses the y-axis), without affecting the line's overall position or slope.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to graph linear equations and only focus on the y-intercept without considering how the constant affects the entire line.
* When students are solving problems that involve changing the constant term in a linear equation and they only think about how it affects the y-intercept, rather than how it affects the entire line.
* When comparing the graphs of multiple linear equations with different constant terms, students may incorrectly assume that the only difference between the lines is the y-intercept, without recognizing that the entire line has been shifted up or down."
781,"When reading decimals on a number line, assumes each dash is 0.2","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to number lines with decimal values. They may mistakenly believe that each dash or mark on the number line represents an increment of 0.2, rather than understanding that the spacing between marks can vary depending on the scale of the number line. For example, if a number line is marked with increments of 0.1, a student with this misconception may think that each dash represents 0.2, leading to incorrect readings and calculations.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When a student is asked to identify the value of a point on a number line marked with decimal increments, they may misread the scale and provide an incorrect answer.
- When comparing the values of two points on a number line, a student may incorrectly determine the difference between the two points due to their misunderstanding of the scale.
- When using a number line to add or subtract decimals, a student with this misconception may perform calculations incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.
- When solving real-world problems that involve measuring lengths or quantities using decimal values, a student's misunderstanding of the number line scale can lead to incorrect conversions or calculations."
782,Mixes up quantitative and qualitative data types,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between quantitative data (numerical data that can be measured and expressed in numbers) and qualitative data (non-numerical data that describes characteristics or attributes). Students may incorrectly identify numerical data as categorical or vice versa, leading to errors in data analysis and interpretation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Categorizing exam scores (quantitative) as ""good"" or ""bad"" (qualitative) and attempting to perform statistical operations on these categories.
2. Trying to calculate the mean or median of a list of favorite colors (qualitative) collected from a survey.
3. Identifying the number of hours spent watching TV (quantitative) as a type of favorite activity (qualitative).
4. Attempting to create a bar graph for a set of numerical data (e.g., heights of students) but labeling the x-axis with categories (e.g., ""tall"", ""medium"", ""short"") instead of numerical values.
5. Treating a rating scale (e.g., 1-5) as qualitative data and not recognizing that it can be treated as quantitative data for analysis purposes."
783,Thinks the sign of solutions in a quadratic equation is always the same as the constant term,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the sign of the solutions to a quadratic equation is solely determined by the sign of the constant term. They might think that if the constant term is positive, the solutions will be positive, and if the constant term is negative, the solutions will be negative. This misconception neglects the role of the other coefficients in the quadratic equation, particularly the coefficient of the linear term, which can affect the signs of the solutions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When factoring a quadratic equation, a student might assume that a positive constant term will always yield two positive solutions.
- When using the quadratic formula, a student might mistakenly think that the sign of the solutions is determined by the sign of the constant term, ignoring the impact of the discriminant and the coefficient of the linear term.
- When graphing a quadratic function, a student might incorrectly assume that the graph will always intersect the x-axis at points with the same sign as the constant term.
- When solving quadratic inequalities, a student might mistakenly think that the sign of the solutions is determined by the sign of the constant term, leading to incorrect conclusions about the solution set."
784,Thinks there are 100g in a kilogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between grams (g) and kilograms (kg). They may have difficulty comprehending the concept of units and conversion between them. A kilogram is a larger unit of mass, and students may incorrectly assume that 1 kilogram is equal to 100 grams, rather than the correct conversion of 1 kilogram being equal to 1000 grams.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the weights of different objects in grams and kilograms.
- When converting between grams and kilograms in recipes or measurement problems.
- When solving math problems that involve adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing weights in grams and kilograms.
- When reading labels or instructions that include measurements in grams and kilograms, such as food packaging or medication instructions.
- When completing tasks that require precise measurements, such as science experiments or cooking."
785,Confuses co-interior and alternate angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between co-interior and alternate angles, often mistakenly assuming they are the same or confusing their properties. Co-interior angles are the angles on the same side of the transversal line and inside the two lines, while alternate angles are the angles on opposite sides of the transversal line and inside the two lines. Students may incorrectly identify or calculate these angles due to a lack of understanding of their definitions and relationships.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When identifying angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal, students might incorrectly label co-interior angles as alternate angles or vice versa.
- In problems involving calculating missing angles, students may apply the wrong property, such as using the alternate angle property for co-interior angles or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving intersecting lines, students may incorrectly assume that co-interior angles are equal, when in fact they are supplementary, or that alternate angles are supplementary, when in fact they are equal."
786,"Believes they write the digits next to each other instead of multiplying, when multiplying a vector by an integer.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to multiply a vector by a scalar (integer) and instead of performing the multiplication operation, they simply write the integer next to the vector, often treating it as a digit concatenation rather than a multiplication. For example, when multiplying the vector 3i + 4j by the integer 2, students with this misconception might write 23i + 24j or even 23i + 4j, rather than the correct result of 6i + 8j.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying a vector by a large integer, students might get confused and simply write the integer next to the vector, forgetting the multiplication rules.
- When dealing with complex vectors, students might struggle to apply the multiplication rules correctly and resort to writing the digits next to each other.
- In problems involving multiple operations, such as adding or subtracting vectors after multiplication, students with this misconception might carry the error through the subsequent operations, leading to incorrect answers.
- When working with vectors in different forms, such as component form or unit vector form, students might get confused about how to apply the multiplication rules, leading to the misconception."
787,Does not scale up a ratio to find an equivalent value,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that ratios can be scaled up to find equivalent values. They may believe that the only way to work with ratios is to use the exact numbers given, without realizing that multiplying or dividing both parts of the ratio by the same number will result in an equivalent ratio. This can lead to difficulties when working with problems that require finding equivalent ratios, such as scaling up a recipe, comparing proportions, or solving problems involving similar shapes.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- A recipe for making 6 cupcakes requires a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour. If a student wants to make 12 cupcakes, they may not realize that they can simply double the ratio to 4:6, and instead try to use the original ratio.
- A student is given a ratio of 3:4 of boys to girls in a class and is asked to find the number of boys and girls if there are 24 students in total. They may struggle to scale up the ratio to find the equivalent values.
- When working with similar shapes, a student may not recognize that the ratio of corresponding sides can be scaled up to find the lengths of the sides of the larger shape."
788,Believes all linear graphs show direct proportion,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that any linear graph represents a direct proportion. They might think that as long as the graph is a straight line, it automatically implies a direct proportion between the variables. However, direct proportion requires that the line passes through the origin (0,0), meaning that when one variable is zero, the other variable is also zero, and the ratio between the variables is constant.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When analyzing the cost of renting a car with a fixed initial fee, students might think that the linear graph of total cost vs. number of days is a direct proportion, ignoring the initial fee.
- When examining a linear relationship between the cost of goods and the number of items purchased, students may overlook the possibility of a fixed cost or starting value that would shift the line away from the origin.
- When looking at a graph of distance vs. time for an object moving at a constant speed, but with an initial distance from the starting point, students might incorrectly assume a direct proportion."
789,Does not understand the naming structure of polygons,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the systematic way of naming polygons based on the number of sides they have. Polygons are named using Greek prefixes that correspond to the number of sides, such as 'tri-' for three, 'quad-' for four, 'penta-' for five, and so on. However, students with this misconception may not grasp this pattern and fail to recognize or remember the names of polygons, leading to confusion and errors.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify and name different polygons, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, or hexagons.
- When students are required to classify polygons into different categories based on their number of sides or properties.
- When students are asked to create or draw specific types of polygons, but struggle to recall the correct name or number of sides required.
- When students encounter more complex or lesser-known polygons, such as heptagons, octagons, or nonagons, and are unsure of how to name them.
- When students are faced with word problems or real-world applications involving polygons, but their lack of understanding of polygon names hinders their ability to solve the problem."
790,Thinks the shape of the graph does not affect the area calculation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that regardless of the shape of a graph, the area under it or enclosed by it can be calculated using the same formula or method. They may think that the area of any shape can be determined by simply multiplying the base by the height or using a single formula, without considering the specific characteristics of the shape. For example, they might attempt to use the formula for the area of a rectangle (length x width) to calculate the area under a curve or the area of a triangle.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When finding the area under a curve, students might try to use a simple multiplication of the base and height, without considering the shape of the curve.
- When comparing the areas of different shapes, students may assume that the shape with the larger base or height will always have the larger area, regardless of its actual shape.
- When solving problems involving real-world applications, such as finding the area of a roof or the area under a velocity-time graph, students may neglect to consider the specific shape of the graph or object."
791,"In a worded problem, does not complete all calculations","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with a multi-step word problem that requires various calculations to solve. They may perform some of the necessary calculations but fail to complete all the steps required to find the final answer. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the problem, not reading the problem carefully, or simply not checking their work to ensure they have completed all the necessary steps.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A problem that involves multiple calculations such as finding the area of a room and then the cost of carpeting it.
- A problem that requires converting between units, such as finding the total cost of items in a shopping list where prices are given in different units.
- A problem that involves multiple steps, such as calculating the total cost of a trip, including transportation, accommodation, and food.
- A problem that requires finding the difference or sum of two or more quantities that require calculations, such as finding the difference in the cost of two different options for a school trip.
- A problem that involves calculating a percentage or fraction of a quantity that itself requires a calculation, such as finding 20% of the total cost of items in a shopping list."
792,Expands when asked to simplify,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that simplifying an algebraic expression or a fraction means expanding it, rather than reducing it to its simplest form. They may think that they need to multiply out brackets, expand formulas, or break down fractions into their constituent parts, rather than cancelling out common factors or combining like terms.

This misconception can lead students to produce answers that are more complicated than they need to be, and may even result in incorrect solutions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as (x + 2)(x + 3), students may expand the brackets instead of leaving the expression in its factored form.
* When simplifying fractions, such as 4/8, students may break down the fraction into 2/4 or even 1/2 + 1/4, instead of simply cancelling out the common factor of 4.
* When working with formulas, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = lw), students may expand the formula to A = l × w instead of leaving it in its simplified form.
* When solving equations, such as x + 2 = 5, students may expand the equation to x + 2 - 2 = 5 - 2, instead of simply subtracting 2 from both sides."
793,Forgets to subtract sum of angles we know from 180 to find missing angle in a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with problems involving finding a missing angle in a triangle. They understand that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, but they often forget to subtract the sum of the angles they already know from 180 degrees to find the missing angle. This results in them not being able to find the correct measure of the missing angle.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When given two angles in a triangle and asked to find the third angle, students might simply add the two given angles together without subtracting their sum from 180 degrees.
- In problems where the missing angle is a right angle (90 degrees) or an obtuse angle, students may get confused and not apply the subtraction method to find the missing angle.
- When working with word problems involving real-life scenarios, such as finding the angle of a roof or the angle of a shadow, students may forget to apply the subtraction method to find the missing angle in the triangle.
- In situations where students are given multiple steps to solve a problem, they may forget to subtract the sum of known angles from 180 degrees in the process of finding the missing angle."
794,Rounds up rather than to one significant figure,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round a number to one significant figure, but instead, they round up to the nearest whole number or the next largest number. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of significant figures, which is a way of expressing the precision of a number. Students may think that rounding up is always the correct approach, without considering the context and the level of precision required.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to round 4.9 to one significant figure, they may answer 5 instead of 5 is correct in this case but they are doing it for the wrong reason.
- When a student is asked to round 4.2 to one significant figure, they may answer 5 instead of 4.
- When a student is asked to round 0.95 to one significant figure, they may answer 1 instead of 1, again correct answer but for wrong reason.
- When a student is asked to round 0.45 to one significant figure, they may answer 1 instead of 0.5."
795,Ignores the negative signs when adding positive and negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to consider the effect of negative signs when adding a mix of positive and negative numbers. They may treat all numbers as positive and simply add them together, ignoring the rules of adding integers with different signs. For example, when asked to calculate 5 + (-3), a student with this misconception might answer 8, because they add 5 and 3 without considering the negative sign in front of the 3.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When adding two numbers with different signs, like 4 + (-2) or -1 + 6.
- When dealing with word problems that involve temperatures, like ""The temperature rose from -2°C to 5°C, what's the total change in temperature?""
- When working with money problems that involve debts or losses, like ""Tom has $15, but he owes his friend $8, how much money does Tom have in total?"""
796,Draws both angles at the same end of the line when constructing a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to construct a triangle given two angles and a side, or other similar triangle construction tasks. Students with this misconception tend to incorrectly draw both angles at the same end of the given line, rather than correctly placing one angle at each end of the line. This results in an incorrect triangle shape or an incomplete triangle.

This misconception may arise due to a lack of understanding of the triangle construction process, difficulty with spatial reasoning, or a misunderstanding of how to interpret the given information.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When asked to construct a triangle with two given angles and a side, the student draws both angles sharing the same vertex, instead of placing them at opposite ends of the side.
- In a task to construct a triangle given two angles and a side, the student incorrectly places both angles adjacent to each other, creating an incorrect triangle shape.
- During a lesson on triangle construction, the student consistently draws both angles at the same end of the given line, indicating a misunderstanding of the construction process."
797,Reflects horizontally or vertically instead of across a diagonal line of symmetry,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to reflect a shape or object across a line of symmetry, but they mistakenly reflect it horizontally or vertically instead of across a diagonal line. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of line symmetry, particularly when it comes to diagonal lines. Students may be familiar with reflecting shapes across horizontal or vertical lines, but struggle to apply the same concept to diagonal lines.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When reflecting a shape across a diagonal line that is not parallel to the x or y axis.
* When dealing with complex shapes that have multiple lines of symmetry, including diagonal lines.
* When reflecting a shape across a diagonal line that passes through the origin (0, 0) on a coordinate grid.
* When working with real-world examples, such as reflecting a logo or image across a diagonal line to create a symmetrical design.
* When solving problems involving congruent and similar figures, where reflections across diagonal lines are required."
798,Believes all numbers in a prime factor tree are included in the list of prime factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the purpose of a prime factor tree. They may think that every number that appears in the tree is a prime factor, including the original number and intermediate composite numbers. In reality, a prime factor tree is a tool used to break down a number into its prime factors, and only the prime numbers at the end of the branches should be considered as prime factors.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When a student is asked to find the prime factors of 24 and they include 4, 6, or 12 in their list because these numbers appear in the prime factor tree.
- When a student is asked to find the prime factors of 36 and they include 6 or 9 in their list because these numbers appear in the prime factor tree.
- When a student is asked to find the prime factors of 48 and they include 4, 6, 8, or 12 in their list because these numbers appear in the prime factor tree."
799,Only considers elements in one set when asked to find the union of multiple sets,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the union of multiple sets, but they only consider the elements in one of the sets, neglecting the elements in the other sets. They may incorrectly assume that the union of sets is the same as one of the individual sets, rather than the collection of all unique elements from all the sets.

This misconception can lead students to leave out elements that are only present in other sets, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the union of two or more sets with some common elements, students may only list the elements from one set, ignoring the unique elements from the other sets.
- When dealing with sets that have overlapping elements, students may assume that the union is the same as one of the individual sets, rather than combining all the unique elements.
- When working with multiple sets, students may focus on the set with the most elements and ignore the elements in the other sets, leading to an incomplete union.
- When asked to find the union of sets with different types of elements (e.g., numbers, letters, shapes), students may only consider the elements from one set and neglect the others."
800,Thinks you just add a % sign to the numerator to make a fraction into a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a percentage simply involves adding a percentage sign (%) to the numerator of the fraction, without actually performing the necessary calculations to convert the fraction to a decimal and then to a percentage. 

For example, given the fraction 3/4, a student with this misconception might write 3% as the equivalent percentage, ignoring the denominator and the actual proportion it represents.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When comparing fractions and percentages in real-world problems, like calculating discounts or interest rates.
- In data analysis, when students are asked to represent data in different forms, including fractions and percentages.
- In everyday conversations, when discussing probabilities, rates of change, or proportions.
- When solving problems that involve converting between fractions, decimals, and percentages."
801,Forgets to give the centre of rotation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with rotations in geometry, particularly when describing or visualizing the rotation of a shape. The student may correctly identify the angle of rotation but forget to specify or identify the centre of rotation, which is a crucial element in defining the rotation. Without the centre of rotation, the rotation is not fully described, leading to ambiguity or incorrect conclusions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When describing the rotation of a shape in a geometry problem, a student might say ""the shape is rotated by 90 degrees"" without specifying the centre of rotation.
- When asked to perform a rotation on a coordinate grid, a student might rotate the shape around an incorrect point or assume the origin (0,0) is the centre of rotation without confirming.
- In a construction task, a student might correctly construct the rotated image but fail to mark or identify the centre of rotation, making it unclear how the rotation was performed."
802,"Thinks that when drawing the elevation, the top layer does not need to be included ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to draw the elevation or side view of a 3D object, and they mistakenly believe that the top layer or surface does not need to be included in the drawing. They might think that only the vertical sides and the base of the object are necessary, omitting the top surface. This can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate representation of the object.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When drawing the elevation of a rectangular prism or a cuboid, students might only draw the vertical sides and the base, leaving out the top surface.
* When creating a side view of a building or a structure with multiple layers, students might forget to include the topmost layer, such as the roof.
* When drawing the elevation of a stepped or layered object, students might only include the vertical sides and the base, neglecting to draw each individual step or layer, including the topmost one."
803,Believes an axis is scaled correctly if the marked values increase in a linear pattern (ignores the distance from the origin to the first value) ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students focus solely on the equal intervals between consecutive marked values on an axis, assuming that as long as the values increase in a linear pattern, the axis is scaled correctly. They overlook the fact that the distance from the origin (usually 0) to the first marked value must also be taken into account to ensure accurate scaling.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing data on a coordinate plane, a student marks the x-axis with values 2, 4, 6, and 8 at equal intervals, but fails to leave the correct amount of space between 0 and 2.
- When creating a bar graph, a student labels the y-axis with values 5, 10, 15, and 20, with equal gaps between the values, but neglects to adjust the spacing from the origin (0) to the first value (5).
- When plotting a line graph, a student marks the x-axis with values 10, 20, 30, and 40, with equal intervals between the values, but ignores the fact that the distance from 0 to 10 should be the same as the distance between each subsequent value."
804,Believes percentages cannot be converted into fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students view percentages and fractions as two separate and distinct mathematical concepts, without understanding the relationship between them. They may think that percentages are only used for specific types of problems, such as calculating interest or discounts, and that fractions are only used for other types of problems, such as dividing pizzas or measuring ingredients. As a result, they may not realize that percentages can be converted into equivalent fractions, and vice versa.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When comparing discounts or increases in prices, students may not recognize that a 25% discount is equivalent to a 1/4 reduction in price.
* When calculating interest rates, students may not understand that a 5% interest rate is equivalent to a 1/20 interest rate.
* When interpreting statistical data, students may not realize that a 30% success rate is equivalent to a 3/10 success rate.
* When measuring ingredients for a recipe, students may not recognize that a 25% increase in the amount of an ingredient is equivalent to adding 1/4 of the original amount."
805,Believes a rotation and a reflection can be combined by applying the rotation to the mirror line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that combining a rotation and a reflection involves applying the rotation to the mirror line of the reflection. They may think that the rotation is being performed on the axis of reflection itself, rather than understanding that the rotation and reflection are two distinct transformations that need to be composed in a specific order.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When describing the symmetries of a shape, a student might incorrectly state that a rotation of 90 degrees around a point, followed by a reflection in a line passing through that point, is equivalent to rotating the mirror line itself by 90 degrees.
- When solving problems involving the composition of transformations, a student might incorrectly apply a rotation to the mirror line of a reflection, rather than applying the rotation to the original shape and then reflecting the result.
- When visualizing the combination of a rotation and a reflection, a student might imagine the rotation as ""twisting"" the mirror line, rather than understanding that the rotation and reflection are two separate transformations that need to be applied in sequence."
806,Thinks the number in the ratio is the total,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the numbers in a ratio as the total quantity instead of understanding it as a comparison between two or more parts. For example, in the ratio 2:3, students may think that there are a total of 2 items and 3 items, rather than understanding that for every 2 parts of one item, there are 3 parts of another item.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When simplifying ratios, students may incorrectly simplify the ratio by adding the numbers together (e.g., 2:3 becomes 5).
- When sharing items in a given ratio, students may distribute the items based on the individual numbers instead of the relative proportions (e.g., sharing 10 items in the ratio 2:3, a student might give 2 items to one person and 3 items to another, instead of dividing the 10 items into 2/5 and 3/5 parts).
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios, students may incorrectly calculate the total amount by adding the numbers in the ratio instead of scaling up or down (e.g., if a recipe requires a 2:3 ratio of flour to sugar, and the student wants to make twice the amount, they might incorrectly calculate the total amount of flour and sugar as 2 + 3 = 5, instead of multiplying each part by 2)."
807,Believes all quadratic equations have a solution of 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that all quadratic equations have a solution of 0, possibly due to an overemphasis on the fact that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is c/a, and in some cases, c can be 0. They may also be incorrectly generalizing from specific examples where 0 is a solution, such as the equation x^2 = 0, and applying it to all quadratic equations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving quadratic equations in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where students may immediately assume 0 as a solution without properly factoring or using the quadratic formula.
- When graphing quadratic functions, students may assume the graph always intersects the x-axis at (0,0), regardless of the equation's actual roots.
- When solving word problems that involve quadratic equations, students may incorrectly assume that the solution is always 0, even if the context of the problem does not support this answer.
- When simplifying quadratic expressions, students may mistakenly set the expression equal to 0 and assume that the solution is 0, rather than simplifying the expression further to find its actual value."
808,Thinks they double rather than halve when finding the area of a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a triangle and mistakenly believe that to find the area, they need to double the base and height, rather than halving the product of the base and height. They may incorrectly apply the formula for the area of a rectangle or parallelogram to a triangle, forgetting that a triangle is half of a parallelogram. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of area and the specific formula for finding the area of a triangle.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the area of a right-angled triangle with a given base and height.
- When comparing the areas of a triangle and a rectangle with the same base and height.
- When solving problems that involve finding the area of a triangular shape in real-life scenarios, such as the area of a triangular garden or a triangular roof.
- When calculating the area of a triangle using real-world measurements, such as finding the area of a triangular piece of land.
- When working with word problems that require finding the area of a triangle to determine quantities such as the amount of paint or carpet needed."
809,Uses cos when tan is required,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with trigonometric ratios in geometry, particularly in right-angled triangles. They may incorrectly use the cosine (cos) function instead of the tangent (tan) function to find the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. This can happen when students are not fully understanding the definitions of the trigonometric ratios or are not paying attention to the specific sides of the triangle involved in the problem.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the gradient of a slope in a right-angled triangle, where the student uses cos instead of tan to calculate the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
- Solving problems involving the angle of elevation or depression, where the student incorrectly uses cos to find the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
- Calculating the height of an object or building using the angle of elevation and the distance from the object, where the student mistakenly uses cos instead of tan.
- Determining the length of the shadow of an object given the angle of elevation and the height of the object, where the student incorrectly uses cos instead of tan."
810,Believes the number outside the circles in a Venn represents the intersection,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misinterpret the information presented in a Venn diagram. They mistakenly believe that the number outside the overlapping circles represents the intersection or the common elements between the two sets, rather than the number inside the overlapping region. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly identify the common elements between two sets and make incorrect calculations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify the number of elements common to two sets, they may look for numbers outside the circles instead of inside the overlapping region.
- When solving problems involving set operations, such as finding the union or intersection of two sets, students may incorrectly use the number outside the circles, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When interpreting real-world data presented in a Venn diagram, students may misinterpret the information and draw incorrect conclusions about the relationships between the sets."
811,Believes they can multiply/divide through by a negative number without changing the direction of the inequality,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with inequalities and are required to perform operations involving negative numbers. They may believe that, just like with equations, they can simply multiply or divide both sides of the inequality by a negative number without affecting the direction of the inequality sign. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of how inequalities work and how operations with negative numbers can impact the relationship between the two sides of the inequality.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving linear inequalities, such as -2x > 4, where students might multiply both sides by -1 and write 2x > -4, without changing the direction of the inequality sign.
- When working with systems of inequalities, where students might need to multiply one of the inequalities by a negative number to make the coefficients of a variable the same, but forget to change the direction of the inequality sign.
- When solving problems involving temperature changes or other real-world applications, where negative numbers are used to represent decreases or opposite directions, and students might incorrectly apply the rules of inequalities."
812,When dividing numbers with the same base correctly subtracts the powers but divides the base numbers.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers with the same base in exponential form. They understand that when multiplying numbers with the same base, they should add the powers, but when dividing, they incorrectly apply a similar rule by subtracting the powers, which is correct, but also divide the base numbers. This shows a misunderstanding of the properties of exponents and the rules for dividing exponential expressions.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dividing 8^4 by 8^2, students may calculate it as (8/8)^(4-2) = 1^2 = 1, instead of simply 8^(4-2) = 8^2.
- When dividing 2^6 by 2^3, students may calculate it as (2/2)^(6-3) = 1^3 = 1, instead of simply 2^(6-3) = 2^3.
- When dividing 5^8 by 5^4, students may calculate it as (5/5)^(8-4) = 1^4 = 1, instead of simply 5^(8-4) = 5^4."
813,Believes parallel is the term used to describe two lines at right angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of parallel lines and confuse it with perpendicular lines. They may think that parallel lines are the lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle, rather than understanding that parallel lines are actually lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify parallel lines in a diagram and they point to two lines that intersect at a right angle.
- When students are given a real-world example, such as a picture of a window with a horizontal and vertical frame, and they describe the horizontal and vertical lines as parallel.
- When students are solving a problem involving shapes, such as finding the perimeter of a rectangle, and they incorrectly identify the lines that meet at a right angle as parallel.
- When students are working with geometric shapes and mistakenly believe that two lines that form an 'L' shape are parallel."
814,Confuses circumference and radius,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly interchange the definitions and formulas of circumference and radius of a circle. They may incorrectly use the formula for circumference (C = 2πr) to calculate the radius, or vice versa, thinking that the radius is the distance around the circle. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when solving problems involving circles.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the perimeter of a circle, a student might use the radius formula (r = C / 2π) to find the circumference.
- When finding the distance around a circular object, a student might use the radius instead of the circumference.
- When solving problems involving the area of a circle (A = πr^2), a student might mistakenly use the circumference formula to calculate the area.
- When comparing the sizes of different circles, a student might think that a circle with a larger radius has a smaller circumference, or vice versa."
815,Counts in the wrong direction on a number line,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of a number line and how numbers are ordered on it. They may count in the wrong direction, often starting from the correct point but moving in the opposite direction of what is intended. For example, if asked to count up 5 numbers from 10, a student with this misconception may count down instead, resulting in 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.

This misconception can manifest in various situations, such as:

- When asked to find a number a certain number of units away from a given point on the number line.
- When comparing numbers on a number line to determine which one is greater or lesser.
- When performing basic addition and subtraction operations that involve moving along the number line.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to count up 3 numbers from 7 on a number line. Instead of counting 8, 9, 10, they count 6, 5, 4.
- Case 2: A student is asked to find the number that is 2 units to the right of 5 on a number line. Instead of answering 7, they answer 3.
- Case 3: A student is asked to solve the equation 5 + 2 using a number line. Instead of moving 2 units to the right of 5 and landing on 7, they move 2 units to the left and land on 3."
816,Only counts visible faces,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count the number of faces of a three-dimensional object, but they only count the faces that are visible to them, rather than considering all the faces, including the ones that are hidden from view. This misconception can lead students to undercount the total number of faces of an object.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When counting the number of faces of a cube, a student may only count the 3 faces they can see, rather than realizing that there are 3 more faces on the other side.
- When counting the number of faces of a rectangular prism, a student may only count the 3 faces they can see, and forget about the other 3 faces that are not visible.
- When counting the number of faces of a more complex polyhedron, such as a triangular prism, a student may only count the faces that are easily visible and miss the ones that are hidden or partially obscured."
817,Believes adding numbers together gives the highest common factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD). They mistakenly believe that adding two or more numbers together will result in their HCF. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the definition of HCF, which is actually the largest positive integer that divides each of the numbers without leaving a remainder.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the HCF of two small numbers, e.g., 4 and 6, students might add them together and say the HCF is 10.
- When dealing with numbers that have a small difference, e.g., 10 and 12, students might think adding them together (22) gives the HCF.
- In word problems where the HCF is needed to solve a real-life scenario, such as sharing items into equal groups, students might incorrectly add the numbers together to find the HCF."
818,Believes the median is the category with the median frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the median of a dataset is the category or value that has the middle frequency, rather than the middle value of the dataset when it is arranged in order. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly identify the median, especially when dealing with categorical data or discrete numerical data.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: In a survey of favorite colors, the frequencies are: Red (5), Blue (8), Green (3), Yellow (2). A student may incorrectly identify Blue as the median because it has the middle frequency, rather than arranging the data in order and finding the middle value.
- Case 2: In a dataset of exam scores with frequencies: 50-59 (4), 60-69 (7), 70-79 (3), 80-89 (6), a student may mistakenly choose the score range 60-69 as the median because it has the highest frequency, rather than finding the actual median score.
- Case 3: In a dataset of the number of siblings students have, with frequencies: 0 (2), 1 (5), 2 (4), 3 (3), a student may incorrectly identify 1 as the median because it has the highest frequency, rather than arranging the data in order and finding the middle value."
819,"When drawing a cumulative frequency diagram, thinks you plot the upper bound of the class intervals on the vertical axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the upper bound of each class interval should be plotted on the vertical axis of a cumulative frequency diagram, rather than the cumulative frequency itself. They may think that the vertical axis is used to show the upper limits of the class intervals, rather than the running total of frequencies. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect plotting and interpretation of the cumulative frequency diagram.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When students are given a set of grouped data and are asked to create a cumulative frequency diagram, they may incorrectly label the vertical axis with the upper bounds of the class intervals (e.g., 10, 20, 30, etc.) instead of the cumulative frequencies (e.g., 5, 15, 25, etc.).
* When students are asked to read values from a cumulative frequency diagram, they may look for the upper bound of a class interval on the vertical axis instead of looking for the corresponding cumulative frequency.
* When students are comparing two or more cumulative frequency diagrams, they may mistakenly compare the upper bounds of the class intervals on the vertical axis instead of comparing the cumulative frequencies."
820,Does not know that you can leave a fraction in improper form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that fractions must always be simplified to their proper form, where the numerator is smaller than the denominator. They may think that an improper fraction, where the numerator is larger than or equal to the denominator, is incorrect or incomplete. As a result, they may always try to convert improper fractions to mixed numbers or simplify them to proper fractions, not realizing that improper fractions can be a valid and useful way to express a quantity.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When adding or subtracting fractions, and the result is an improper fraction (e.g., 3/4 + 3/4 = 6/4).
* When multiplying fractions, and the product is an improper fraction (e.g., 2/3 × 3/2 = 6/6 or 2).
* When simplifying complex fractions, and the result is an improper fraction (e.g., 6/4 ÷ 2/3 = 9/4).
* When working with equivalent ratios, and an improper fraction is a valid equivalent form (e.g., 6/4 = 3/2)."
821,Mistakes rotations for translations,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between two fundamental concepts in geometry: rotations and translations. A rotation is a transformation that involves turning a shape around a fixed point, whereas a translation is a transformation that involves moving a shape a certain distance in a specific direction. Students who hold this misconception may incorrectly identify a rotation as a translation, or vice versa, because they may focus on the fact that the shape has moved, without considering the nature of the movement.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When describing the movement of a shape in a coordinate plane, a student might say that a shape has been ""moved"" when it has actually been rotated around the origin.
- When solving a problem involving symmetry, a student might mistakenly identify a rotation as a translation because they see the shape in a new position, without realizing that it has been turned.
- When working with geometric shapes in real-world applications, such as designing a pattern or a layout, students may incorrectly apply a translation instead of a rotation, or vice versa, resulting in an incorrect design.
- When analyzing a transformation in a diagram, a student might incorrectly label a rotation as a translation because they focus on the distance the shape has moved, rather than the fact that it has also changed direction."
822,"When rounding, believes that if the number, after the required degree of accuracy, is a 5 or below you round down","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are taught to round numbers, but they misinterpret the rule for rounding. They believe that if the digit after the required degree of accuracy is 5 or below, they should always round down, rather than considering the context of the number and the specific rounding rule.

For example, when rounding to the nearest whole number, students with this misconception may round 2.5 down to 2, instead of considering the convention of rounding to the nearest even number in the case of a tie (i.e., 2.5 would be rounded to 3, since 3 is the nearest even number when rounding from 2.5).

This misconception can lead to errors in calculations and measurements, particularly in situations where precision is important.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 4.5 to the nearest whole number, resulting in 4 instead of 5.
- Rounding 2.5 to the nearest whole number, resulting in 2 instead of 3.
- Rounding 10.5 to the nearest ten, resulting in 10 instead of 10 being rounded to the nearest even number (10 is even, but the rule of rounding to the nearest even is not applied).
- Rounding 12.5 to one decimal place, resulting in 12.4 instead of 12.5."
823,Assumes they multiply by the numerator of fractional index,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with fractional indices, which can be a complex concept in algebra. When simplifying expressions with fractional indices, students might mistakenly think that they need to multiply the base by the numerator of the fractional index, rather than understanding the correct application of the index rules.

For instance, when simplifying the expression 2^(3/4), students with this misconception might multiply 2 by 3, resulting in an incorrect answer. This misconception can stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of fractional indices and how they relate to the rules of indices.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying the expression 4^(2/3) and thinking the answer is 4 * 2 = 8.
- Evaluating the expression 3^(1/2) and believing the result is 3 * 1 = 3.
- Solving the expression (2^3)^(1/2) and mistakenly multiplying 2^3 by 1, rather than applying the correct index rule."
824,"Believes rounding to 1 decimal pleace means rounding to the nearest integer, regardless of the value of the number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of rounding numbers to a specific decimal place. They incorrectly assume that rounding to 1 decimal place means rounding the entire number to the nearest whole number, disregarding the actual value of the number after the decimal point.

For example, when asked to round 4.7 to 1 decimal place, a student with this misconception may incorrectly round it to 5, thinking that they need to round to the nearest whole number. Similarly, when asked to round 2.3 to 1 decimal place, they may incorrectly round it to 2, again ignoring the value after the decimal point.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When dealing with measurement units, like rounding 4.7 meters to 1 decimal place.
- When calculating prices or costs, like rounding $2.30 to 1 decimal place.
- When working with data and statistics, like rounding the average of a set of numbers to 1 decimal place.
- When solving algebraic equations, like rounding the solution to an equation to 1 decimal place.

In each of these cases, the student's misconception can lead to incorrect answers and a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts."
825,"thinks when writing a mixed number fraction as an improper fraction, you need to multiply the denominator by the whole ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting a mixed number to an improper fraction. They mistakenly believe that to get the improper fraction, they need to multiply the denominator by the whole number part, rather than understanding the actual process of conversion. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between mixed numbers and improper fractions, or simply a misunderstanding of the conversion procedure.

For example, given the mixed number 3 1/4, a student with this misconception may incorrectly convert it to an improper fraction by multiplying the denominator (4) by the whole number part (3), resulting in an incorrect solution.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Converting mixed numbers with simple fractions, such as 2 1/2 or 3 3/4.
- Working with mixed numbers in real-world applications, like measuring ingredients for a recipe or calculating lengths of materials.
- Solving problems involving the addition or subtraction of mixed numbers, where conversion to improper fractions is necessary.
- Simplifying complex fractions or algebraic expressions that involve mixed numbers."
826,Confuses intersection and universal set,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concepts of intersection and universal set in set theory, which is a fundamental part of mathematics, particularly in the realm of Geometry, Data, and Statistics, as well as Algebra.

The intersection of two or more sets refers to the elements that are common to all sets. On the other hand, the universal set is the set that contains all the elements under consideration in a particular problem or context.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that the universal set is the same as the intersection of all sets, or vice versa. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect solutions and interpretations of problems involving set operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. **Venn Diagram Interpretation**: When students are asked to interpret Venn diagrams, they may incorrectly identify the universal set as the intersection of the sets, or vice versa.

2. **Set Operations**: When performing set operations, such as finding the union or intersection of sets, students may mistakenly use the universal set instead of the correct set operation.

3. **Probability and Statistics**: In problems involving probability and statistics, students may incorrectly apply the concept of intersection and universal set, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

4. **Word Problems**: When solving word problems involving sets, students may misinterpret the context and incorrectly apply the concepts of intersection and universal set."
827,Believes when frequencies multiply by a scale factor in a table the mode also multiplies by that scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between frequencies and the mode in a dataset. They incorrectly assume that when the frequencies of each value in a table are multiplied by a scale factor, the mode will also be multiplied by that same scale factor. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of what the mode represents, which is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- A student is given a table showing the favorite colors of a group of people, and they are asked to find the mode after the frequencies have been multiplied by 2. They may incorrectly multiply the mode by 2 as well.
- A student is working with a dataset of exam scores, and they are asked to scale up the frequencies by a factor of 5. They may mistakenly assume that the mode score will also be 5 times the original mode.
- A student is analyzing data on the number of books sold by a bookstore, and they are asked to multiply the frequencies by 10. They may incorrectly conclude that the mode (best-selling book) will also have a value 10 times the original mode."
828,Adds when calculating area instead of multiplying,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the area of a shape, they need to add the length and width together, rather than multiplying them. This can stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of area as a measure of the amount of space inside a shape, and a failure to recognize that multiplication is necessary to account for the two dimensions of the shape.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When calculating the area of a rectangle, a student might add the length and width together, e.g., ""The area of this rectangle is 5 + 3 = 8"" instead of multiplying them, e.g., ""The area of this rectangle is 5 x 3 = 15"".
* When finding the area of a room, a student might add the length and width of the room together, e.g., ""The area of this room is 8 + 6 = 14 square meters"" instead of multiplying them, e.g., ""The area of this room is 8 x 6 = 48 square meters"".
* When solving word problems that involve area, a student might add the dimensions together, e.g., ""Tom has a garden that is 10 meters long and 5 meters wide. What is the area of the garden?"" A student with this misconception might answer, ""The area of the garden is 10 + 5 = 15 square meters"" instead of ""The area of the garden is 10 x 5 = 50 square meters""."
829,Estimates angle rather than calculating,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students rely on visual inspection or rough estimation to determine the measure of an angle, rather than using mathematical techniques or tools to calculate its exact measure. They may use prior experiences or intuition to make an educated guess, but this can often lead to inaccurate results. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur: 

1. Measuring angles in a triangle: Students might estimate the angles in a triangle to be around 60 or 90 degrees based on how they look, rather than using a protractor or angle sum property to calculate the exact measures.

2. Identifying angle types: Students may estimate an angle to be acute or obtuse based on its appearance, rather than measuring it accurately to determine its type.

3. Solving problems involving angles: In word problems or geometric calculations, students might use estimated angle measures, which can lead to incorrect solutions or calculations.

4. Comparing angles: Students might compare angles based on how they look, rather than measuring them accurately to determine which one is larger or smaller.

5. Drawing angles: When asked to draw a specific angle, students might draw an estimated angle based on their visual perception, rather than using a protractor or other tools to draw an accurate angle."
830,Gives an example of a factor instead of counting how many total factors a number has,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the total number of factors a number has, but instead, they provide an example of one of the factors. For instance, if asked to find the total number of factors of the number 12, a student with this misconception might respond with ""2"" or ""3"" because they know that 2 and 3 are factors of 12, but they fail to consider all the other factors, such as 1, 4, 6, and 12. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, including:

- When students are asked to list all the factors of a given number and they only provide a few examples.
- When students are asked to compare the number of factors of two or more numbers, and they incorrectly conclude that the number with the larger factor has more factors.
- When students are solving problems involving the least common multiple (LCM) or greatest common divisor (GCD), and they incorrectly count the number of factors.
- When students are working on problems involving prime factorization and they fail to consider all the factors of a number.
- When students are asked to identify numbers with a certain number of factors, such as prime numbers (which have only two factors), and they incorrectly identify the number due to incomplete factor counting."
831,Thinks subtraction calculates how many in ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that subtraction is used to find the total number of items in a set or group, rather than understanding that subtraction represents the difference or the removal of a certain quantity from a larger quantity. Students may think that subtraction is similar to counting how many items are in a set, rather than finding the difference between two quantities.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When subtracting a smaller number from a larger number, students may think they are counting the total number of items, rather than finding the difference (e.g., 10 - 3 = ?).
- When using real-life examples, such as having 15 pencils and giving 5 away, students may think subtraction is used to count how many pencils they have left, rather than understanding that subtraction is used to find the difference between the initial and final quantities.
- When solving word problems that involve subtraction, students may misinterpret the question and think they need to count the total number of items, rather than finding the difference between two quantities (e.g., ""Tom has 12 books, and he gives 4 to his friend. How many books does Tom have now?"")."
832,Believes that a fraction with equal numerator and denominator cancels to 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of equivalent ratios and the process of simplifying fractions. They may believe that when the numerator and denominator of a fraction are the same, the fraction cancels out to 0, rather than understanding that it represents a whole or 1. For example, they may think that 2/2 or 5/5 equals 0, rather than recognizing that these fractions represent a single whole unit.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions, such as 2/2 or 5/5, students may write the answer as 0 instead of 1.
- When comparing fractions, students may incorrectly rank fractions with equal numerators and denominators as less than fractions with smaller numerators, e.g., thinking 2/2 is less than 1/2.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with equal numerators and denominators, students may write the answer as 0 instead of the correct result, e.g., 2/2 + 1/2 = 0 instead of 3/2.
- When converting fractions to decimals or percentages, students may incorrectly convert fractions with equal numerators and denominators to 0, e.g., thinking 5/5 = 0% instead of 100%."
833,"When calculating perimeter, multiplies instead of adds","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the perimeter of a shape, they need to multiply the lengths of its sides instead of adding them together. This can stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of perimeter, which is the total distance around the outside of a shape. Students may get confused with the concept of area, where multiplication is used to find the total space inside a shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is asked to find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm. They may write the answer as 5 x 3 = 15 cm instead of 2(5 + 3) = 16 cm.
2. A student is given a square with a side length of 4 cm and is asked to find its perimeter. They may multiply 4 x 4 = 16 cm instead of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16 cm.
3. A student is asked to find the perimeter of a triangle with sides of 3 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm. They may try to multiply the sides together (3 x 4 x 5 = 60 cm) instead of adding them together (3 + 4 + 5 = 12 cm)."
834,"When asked for the next term in the sequence adds one to the last term given, despite the sequence not going up in ones.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a sequence of numbers and are asked to identify the next term. Instead of analyzing the pattern of the sequence, they simply add 1 to the last term given. This can occur due to a lack of understanding of the underlying pattern or relationship between the numbers in the sequence. Students may be over-relying on their prior experience with simple addition or counting sequences, where adding 1 to get the next term is a valid strategy.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, and they respond with 9 as the next term, instead of recognizing the pattern of adding 2 each time.
- A student is given the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, and they respond with 9 as the next term, instead of recognizing the pattern of doubling each time.
- A student is given the sequence 5, 10, 15, 20, and they respond with 21 as the next term, instead of recognizing the pattern of adding 5 each time."
835,Confuses a formula with an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a formula, which is a general expression that describes a relationship between variables, and an equation, which is a statement that two expressions are equal. A formula is often used to describe a general rule or relationship, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = length × width), whereas an equation is a specific statement that two expressions are equal, such as 2x + 3 = 5.

This misconception can lead to students using formulas and equations interchangeably, resulting in incorrect applications and solutions. For example, students may attempt to solve a formula as if it were an equation, or vice versa.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. In Algebra: When solving problems involving formulas, such as the formula for the slope of a line (m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)), students may attempt to solve for a specific value of m as if it were an equation.
2. In Geometry: When working with formulas for perimeter, area, or volume, students may confuse these formulas with equations and attempt to solve for a specific value.
3. In Physics or Engineering: When working with formulas that describe physical relationships, such as the formula for force (F = ma), students may confuse these formulas with equations and attempt to solve for a specific value.
4. In Data Analysis: When working with formulas for statistical measures, such as the formula for mean or standard deviation, students may confuse these formulas with equations and attempt to solve for a specific value."
836,Believes the mean is the middle number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the mean (or average) of a set of numbers is the middle number in a list of values arranged in order. They may believe that finding the mean involves simply identifying the central number in an ordered list, rather than understanding that the mean is actually calculated by summing all the values and then dividing by the total number of values.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with an odd number of values, where students might coincidentally find the middle value to be close to the actual mean, reinforcing their misunderstanding.
- When working with a small set of numbers, where the difference between the middle value and the actual mean might not be significant, leading students to overlook the error.
- When presented with a set of numbers that are close together, making the middle value appear to be a reasonable estimate of the mean.
- When students have not been exposed to or have not fully understood the concept of how to calculate the mean using the sum of values divided by the number of values."
837,Believes that rounding parts of a fraction in different directions means the answer will be the same. ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that rounding different parts of a fraction (numerator or denominator) in opposite directions will result in the same answer. They may think that rounding the numerator up and the denominator down, or vice versa, will have a negligible effect on the overall value of the fraction. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and estimations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When estimating a fraction's value for a quick calculation, a student may round the numerator up and the denominator down, assuming it won't affect the overall answer.
- When comparing fractions, a student might round parts of each fraction in different directions to make the comparison easier, not realizing the potential error.
- When solving problems involving fractions in algebra or geometry, students may incorrectly round parts of fractions in different directions, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with equivalent ratios, students might assume that rounding different parts of the ratio in opposite directions will still yield an equivalent ratio."
838,"When factorising a quadratic without a non variable term, tries to double bracket factorise","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are over-relying on the double bracket factorisation method, which is commonly used to factorise quadratic expressions of the form ax^2 + bx + c. When faced with a quadratic expression without a non-variable term (i.e., ax^2 + bx), students may mistakenly attempt to force the expression into the double bracket form, rather than recognising that a different method, such as factoring out the greatest common factor, may be more appropriate.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* Factorising expressions like x^2 + 5x, where students might try to find two numbers that multiply to 0 and add to 5, rather than simply factoring out the x.
* Simplifying expressions like 2x^2 + 6x, where students might attempt to double bracket factorise, instead of factoring out the greatest common factor, which is 2x.
* Solving quadratic equations like x^2 + 3x = 0, where students might try to double bracket factorise, rather than recognising that the equation can be solved by factoring out the x."
839,"When dividing by a non unit fraction, thinks you multiply by the reciprocal of the corresponding unit fraction rather than the fraction given. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing by a non-unit fraction and mistakenly believe that they need to find the reciprocal of the corresponding unit fraction instead of the actual fraction given. For instance, if the problem requires dividing 6 by 2/3, the student might incorrectly think that they should multiply 6 by the reciprocal of 1/3 (which is 3) instead of multiplying by the reciprocal of 2/3 (which is 3/2).

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving division problems involving fractions, such as 4 ÷ 3/4 or 9 ÷ 2/5.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe that requires dividing by a non-unit fraction, like 3/4 cup.
- In word problems that involve dividing by a non-unit fraction, like ""A bookshelf is 3/4 full, and the books need to be packed into boxes that hold 1/4 of the bookshelf each. How many boxes can be filled?"""
840,Does not understand the place value of answers from a Napier's bones calculation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using Napier's bones, a historical calculating tool, to perform multiplication and division calculations, but they fail to recognize the place value of the digits in the answer. Napier's bones rely on the concept of place value, where each digit in a number has a place value depending on its position (units, tens, hundreds, etc.). 

Students with this misconception may not understand how to correctly align the numbers on the bones or how to interpret the results, leading to incorrect answers. They might treat the answer as a simple sequence of digits rather than recognizing the place value of each digit.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying multi-digit numbers using Napier's bones, a student may write the answer as a single row of digits without considering the place value of each digit.
- When dividing numbers using Napier's bones, a student may misalign the dividend and the divisor, resulting in an incorrect answer due to a misunderstanding of place value.
- When using Napier's bones to calculate with decimals, a student may fail to account for the decimal point and the place value of the digits before and after it."
841,Does not subtract 2 from the number of sides when finding the sum of interior angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the sum of interior angles in a polygon. They understand that the formula for the sum of interior angles is related to the number of sides of the polygon, but they mistakenly use the formula (n) × 180° or (n) × 90°, where n is the number of sides. They fail to subtract 2 from the number of sides, resulting in an incorrect calculation. This misconception can be due to a lack of understanding of the formula (n-2) × 180° or a simple arithmetic error.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Finding the sum of interior angles in a triangle (3 sides): A student may calculate it as 3 × 180° = 540° instead of (3-2) × 180° = 180°.
- Finding the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral (4 sides): A student may calculate it as 4 × 180° = 720° instead of (4-2) × 180° = 360°.
- Finding the sum of interior angles in a pentagon (5 sides): A student may calculate it as 5 × 180° = 900° instead of (5-2) × 180° = 540°."
842,Confuses the calculations for HCF and LCM,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concepts of Highest Common Factor (HCF) and Lowest Common Multiple (LCM). They may get confused between the two, often using the method for one to calculate the other. HCF is the largest number that divides two or more numbers exactly without a remainder, while LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. Students may mistakenly use the method of finding multiples to calculate HCF or use the method of finding factors to calculate LCM.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When finding the HCF of two numbers, students may list out the multiples of the numbers instead of the factors, leading to an incorrect answer.
- When finding the LCM of two numbers, students may find the common factors instead of the common multiple, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- When solving problems involving fractions and needing to find the common denominator, students may use the HCF instead of LCM, or vice versa.
- When working with ratios and proportions, students may confuse HCF and LCM, leading to incorrect simplifications or comparisons.
- When solving problems in algebra involving the simplification of expressions, students may need to find the HCF or LCM of coefficients or terms, and may apply the wrong method."
843,Does not see fraction diagrams as equivalent if the shading is in a different pattern,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize that fractions with different shaded patterns can still represent the same value. They may believe that the pattern of shading affects the value of the fraction, rather than understanding that the ratio of shaded to unshaded area is the key factor. For example, they may think that a fraction with two shaded blocks out of four is different from a fraction with two shaded blocks that are not adjacent, even though both fractions represent 1/2.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When comparing two fraction diagrams with the same denominator but different shaded patterns, students may insist that they are not equivalent.
- When asked to identify fractions with the same value, students may only select fractions with identical shaded patterns, overlooking equivalent fractions with different patterns.
- When shading a fraction diagram to represent a given value, students may become fixated on replicating a specific pattern rather than focusing on the correct ratio of shaded to unshaded area."
844,Thinks there are 100mm in a metre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 millimeters (mm) in a meter, rather than understanding that there are actually 100 centimeters (cm) or 1000 millimeters (mm) in a meter. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between different units of measurement, particularly between millimeters and meters.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting measurements from meters to millimeters in problems, such as calculating the length of a room or object.
- When comparing lengths measured in meters and millimeters, such as comparing the height of two objects.
- When solving problems that involve measuring lengths in real-world applications, such as measuring the length of a piece of fabric or the height of a building.
- When reading and interpreting scales on measuring instruments, such as rulers or measuring tapes, that are marked in both meters and millimeters."
845,Believes they can find the nth term based on the first term only,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can determine the entire sequence and find any term (nth term) by just knowing the first term of the sequence. They fail to understand the importance of the common difference or common ratio in defining the sequence and determining subsequent terms. They might assume a simple addition or multiplication pattern based on the first term, without considering the actual underlying relationship between terms.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When given a simple arithmetic sequence with a first term that is a small number, such as 2, 4, 6, ... . A student might assume the sequence is formed by adding 2 to the previous term, just because the first term is 2, without checking the actual pattern.
- When dealing with sequences that have a common ratio of 1, where each term is the same as the previous one, such as 5, 5, 5, ... . In this case, a student might assume the sequence only depends on the first term, which is 5, without recognizing the constant ratio.
- When working with sequences that have a simple and repetitive pattern, such as 1, 2, 3, ... . A student might believe they can find the nth term just by counting up from the first term, without considering the underlying structure of the sequence."
846,Thinks there are 1000ml in a centilitre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between units of measurement in the metric system, particularly between milliliters (mL) and centiliters (cL). They mistakenly believe that 1 centilitre (cL) is equal to 1000 milliliters (mL), rather than recognizing that 1 centilitre is actually equal to 10 milliliters.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are converting between units of measurement in recipes or scientific experiments, they may incorrectly scale up or down the quantities.
- In problems involving the measurement of liquids, such as calculating the total volume of a solution or the amount of liquid needed to fill a container.
- When reading labels or instructions that use different units of measurement, such as a medicine bottle that lists the dosage in milliliters, but the student mistakenly thinks it's in centilitres.
- In comparisons or calculations involving different units of measurement, such as comparing the volume of two containers, one measured in milliliters and the other in centilitres."
847,Thinks they can convert a 2 digit percentage to a fraction by writing one number over the other.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a percentage to a fraction involves simply writing the digits of the percentage as the numerator and denominator of a fraction. For example, they might think that 24% can be converted to a fraction by writing 24 as the numerator and 100 is ignored, instead writing 2 as the denominator (2 being one of the digits in 24), resulting in the incorrect fraction 24/2. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When converting 24% to a fraction, a student might write 24/2 instead of the correct conversion.
- When converting 75% to a fraction, a student might write 75/7 or 7/5 instead of the correct conversion.
- When converting 36% to a fraction, a student might write 36/3 or 3/6 instead of the correct conversion.

This misconception reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the concept of percentages and fractions, and how they are related."
848,Believes when simplifying a fraction you can divide the numerator and denominator by different values,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of equivalent ratios in fractions. They may believe that as long as the numerator and denominator are reduced, it doesn't matter if they are divided by the same or different numbers. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the numerator and denominator in a fraction and the importance of maintaining the equivalence of the ratio.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying a fraction like 6/8, a student may divide the numerator by 2 (resulting in 3) and the denominator by 4 (resulting in 2), resulting in an incorrect simplified fraction of 3/2.
- When reducing a fraction like 12/16, a student may divide the numerator by 3 (resulting in 4) and the denominator by 2 (resulting in 8), resulting in an incorrect simplified fraction of 4/8.
- When simplifying a fraction like 9/12, a student may divide the numerator by 3 (resulting in 3) and the denominator by 4 (resulting in 3), resulting in an incorrect simplified fraction of 3/3, which although a correct result in terms of value (since 3/3 = 1), it demonstrates the student's incorrect understanding of the simplification process."
849,Thinks the nth term is when the value of the term is n,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the nth term in a sequence. They mistakenly believe that the nth term refers to the term whose value is equal to n, rather than the term that occupies the nth position in the sequence. For example, in the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., they might think the 4th term is the term that equals 4, rather than the term that appears in the 4th position, which is actually 8.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, students might look for the term that equals n instead of using the formula to find the term in the nth position.
* When working with sequences that have repeating patterns, students might get confused and identify the term that matches the pattern's value rather than its position.
* In word problems, students might misinterpret the question and look for the term that equals a specific value instead of finding the term in a specific position."
850,Thinks there are 10mm in a metre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of the relationship between units of measurement, specifically between millimeters (mm) and meters (m). They may believe that there are only 10 millimeters in a meter, rather than understanding that there are actually 1000 millimeters in a meter. This error could be due to a lack of exposure to conversion between units or a misunderstanding of the metric system.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to convert 1 meter to millimeters, the student may answer 10mm.
- When measuring the length of an object in meters and then asked to express it in millimeters, the student may provide an incorrect conversion.
- In a problem that involves adding or subtracting measurements in meters and millimeters, the student may perform incorrect calculations due to their misunderstanding of the conversion.
- When comparing the lengths of objects measured in meters and millimeters, the student may make incorrect comparisons or order the lengths incorrectly."
851,Thinks a negative x value in a column vector means to move right rather than left ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the sign of the x-component in a column vector. They mistakenly believe that a negative x value indicates movement to the right, rather than the correct interpretation of moving to the left. This misunderstanding may stem from a lack of understanding of the coordinate grid system or a simple sign error.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Graphing a 2D vector with a negative x-component, such as (-3, 4), where the student moves the vector 3 units to the right instead of 3 units to the left.
- Translating a shape on a coordinate plane by a vector with a negative x-component, resulting in the shape being moved in the wrong direction.
- Interpreting the motion of an object represented by a vector with a negative x-component, where the student thinks the object is moving in the opposite direction.
- Determining the resultant vector of two or more vectors with negative x-components, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
852,Thinks there are 100 mg in a gram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 milligrams (mg) in 1 gram. However, this is likely due to the misunderstanding of the metric system and the conversion between units of measurement, particularly between milligrams and grams. The students might be incorrectly applying the conversion factor from centimeters to meters (100 cm = 1 m) to the conversion between milligrams and grams.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting between milligrams and grams in recipe instructions or medication labels, students may think that 100 mg of an ingredient is equivalent to 1 gram.
- In a science experiment, students may measure the mass of an object in milligrams and incorrectly convert it to grams by dividing by 100.
- When solving problems involving the mass of objects, students may consistently use the incorrect conversion factor of 100 mg = 1 g, leading to incorrect calculations and answers.
- In a real-world scenario, students may misinterpret the labels on food or medicine packaging, thinking that 100 mg of a substance is equivalent to 1 gram, which can lead to incorrect consumption or dosage."
853,Does not know how to check tessellation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to determine whether a particular shape can tessellate (cover a surface without overlapping) or not. They may struggle to identify the conditions necessary for a shape to tessellate, such as the shape's internal angles, side lengths, and symmetry. As a result, they may incorrectly assume that any shape can tessellate or may be unable to explain why certain shapes cannot tessellate.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a regular hexagon and asked if it can tessellate, they may be unsure or say no, despite the fact that regular hexagons can indeed tessellate.
- When students are given a shape with irregular sides and angles, they may incorrectly assume that it can tessellate without checking its properties.
- When students are asked to create a tessellation pattern using different shapes, they may struggle to identify which shapes can be used together to create a tessellation.
- When students are given a shape with a complex design, such as a star or a curve, they may be unsure about whether it can tessellate or not.
- When students are asked to explain why a particular shape cannot tessellate, they may struggle to provide a clear reason or may simply say that it ""doesn't fit""."
854,Divided by 100 rather than multiplied by 100,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with percentages, specifically when converting a percentage to a decimal or vice versa. They may incorrectly believe that to convert a percentage to a decimal, they need to divide by 100, rather than understanding that percentages represent a proportion of a whole as a fraction of 100, and therefore need to be divided by 100 to convert to a decimal, but when converting a decimal to a percentage, they incorrectly think to divide by 100 instead of multiplying by 100.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting a percentage to a decimal, for example, 50% converted to a decimal is incorrectly calculated as 50 ÷ 100 = 0.5, but when asked to convert 0.5 to a percentage, the student divides 0.5 by 100.
- Calculating the percentage increase or decrease, where the student may incorrectly divide the increase or decrease by 100 instead of multiplying by 100 to find the percentage.
- Finding the original value before a percentage change, where the student may incorrectly divide by 100 instead of multiplying by 100 to find the original value."
855,Believes integers can have decimal places,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to distinguish between different types of numbers, particularly integers and decimals. They may believe that integers can have decimal places because they misunderstand the definition of an integer or are unclear about the distinction between whole numbers and decimal numbers. For example, they may think that 5.5 is an integer because it is a number, or they may believe that all numbers can be written with decimal places.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing or ordering numbers: Students may think that 5.5 is greater than 5 but still consider it an integer.
- When solving algebraic equations: Students may provide decimal answers for problems that should result in integer solutions, such as solving for the number of items.
- When dealing with real-world applications: Students may incorrectly identify quantities as integers when they have decimal values, such as measuring lengths or weights."
856,"When asked to shade a fraction of a shape, gives the total number of parts rather than the number to be shaded.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to shade a fraction of a shape that is divided into equal parts. Instead of identifying the number of parts that need to be shaded, they provide the total number of parts the shape is divided into. For example, if a circle is divided into 8 equal parts and students are asked to shade 1/4 of it, they might answer '8' instead of '2', thinking that the question is asking for the total number of parts rather than the number of parts that need to be shaded.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When shading fractions of a pizza that is divided into equal-sized slices, a student might give the total number of slices instead of the number of slices to be shaded.
- When coloring a fraction of a rectangle that is divided into equal parts, a student might answer with the total number of parts instead of the number of parts to be colored.
- When asked to shade a fraction of a circle divided into equal sectors, a student might provide the total number of sectors instead of the number of sectors to be shaded."
857,"When the unknown (e.g. x) in an equation is a denominator, gives the value of 1/x rather than x as the answer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving equations where the variable (e.g. x) appears in the denominator. They may incorrectly assume that solving for x means isolating 1/x, rather than isolating x itself. This could be due to a misunderstanding of algebraic manipulations, particularly when dealing with fractions and inverses.

For instance, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving an equation like 2/x = 4, a student may incorrectly conclude that x = 1/2, instead of correctly solving for x.
- In an equation like 1/x + 2 = 3, a student may mistakenly solve for 1/x and stop there, instead of taking the reciprocal to find the value of x.
- When working with a problem like x/2 = 1/4, a student might solve for 1/x and incorrectly assume that x = 2, without properly addressing the relationship between x and 1/x."
858,Believes splitting a multiplication using the distributive property is the same as splitting it into factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the distributive property of multiplication and think it is equivalent to factoring. They may believe that splitting a multiplication into smaller parts using the distributive property (e.g., 3 × (4 + 5)) is the same as splitting it into its factors (e.g., 3 × 4 × 5 or 3 × 9). This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental difference between the distributive property and factorization.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When students are asked to simplify an expression like 2 × (3 + 4), they might respond with 2 × 3 × 4.
- When students are given a multiplication problem like 6 × 9, they might attempt to split it into 6 × (3 + 3 + 3) and then incorrectly factor it further.
- When students are asked to factor an expression like 12 × 8, they might incorrectly apply the distributive property and split it into 12 × (2 + 2 + 2 + 2)."
859,Believes they can factorise a difference of two squares by placing the constant in both brackets without square rooting,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of factoring a difference of two squares, which follows the pattern a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b). However, some students may mistakenly apply this rule by simply placing the constant term in both brackets without taking its square root. For example, when factoring x^2 - 16, they might incorrectly write it as (x + 16)(x - 16) instead of recognizing that 16 is a perfect square (4^2) and correctly factoring it as (x + 4)(x - 4).

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* x^2 - 9, where students might write (x + 9)(x - 9) instead of (x + 3)(x - 3)
* x^2 - 25, where students might write (x + 25)(x - 25) instead of (x + 5)(x - 5)
* 4x^2 - 36, where students might write (2x + 36)(2x - 36) or (2x + 18)(2x - 18) or even (4x + 36)(4x - 36) instead of (2x + 6)(2x - 6)"
860,Mixes up clockwise and anticlockwise,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between clockwise and anticlockwise directions, often leading to confusion in interpreting and describing rotations, turns, and movements in various mathematical contexts, such as geometry and measure.

This misconception may manifest in the following cases:

- When describing the direction of rotation of a shape or object, students may incorrectly identify a clockwise rotation as anticlockwise, or vice versa.
- When working with angles and turns, students may struggle to understand the difference between a 90-degree clockwise turn and a 90-degree anticlockwise turn.
- When following instructions or describing a route on a map or grid, students may become disoriented and confuse the directions, leading to incorrect navigation.
- When solving problems involving circular motion, such as calculating the position of a point on a circle after a certain number of rotations, students may mix up the direction of rotation, leading to incorrect answers.
- When working with time and clocks, students may have difficulty determining the correct direction of clock hands, leading to errors in telling time."
861,Reads a power as a normal digit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students interpret an exponent or power as a regular digit rather than understanding its role in indicating repeated multiplication. For example, when students see the expression 2^3, they may read it as ""2 times 3"" or simply as the number 23, rather than understanding that the 3 represents the power to which the base (2) should be raised.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Reading 2^3 as ""2 times 3"" and calculating the result as 6.
- Reading 2^3 as the number 23, rather than calculating the result as 8.
- Difficulty understanding the concept of exponential growth or decay, as students may not grasp the role of the exponent in determining the magnitude of the result.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions like 3^2, 4^5, or 2^6.
- Solving equations involving exponents, such as 2^x = 16.
- Interpreting real-world applications of exponents, such as population growth or chemical reactions.
- Evaluating numerical expressions involving exponents, such as 2^3 + 4^2."
862,Does not understand equivalent ratios,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend that equivalent ratios represent the same proportional relationship, but with different numbers. They may believe that changing the numbers in a ratio alters the relationship itself, rather than just the scale. For instance, they might not recognize that the ratios 2:3, 4:6, and 6:9 are equivalent, and instead, treat them as distinct and unrelated proportions.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When simplifying ratios, students may not understand that the simplified ratio represents the same relationship as the original ratio (e.g., 6:8 = 3:4).
- When scaling up or down in real-world applications, like cooking or building, students may not recognize that the proportions remain the same even if the quantities change (e.g., doubling a recipe).
- When working with different units, students may not understand that equivalent ratios can be expressed in different units, such as 2:3 being equivalent to 2 cm:3 cm or 2 kg:3 kg.
- When comparing ratios, students may not recognize that equivalent ratios have the same value, and instead, may compare the numbers directly (e.g., 2:3 vs. 3:4, where they might incorrectly say 3:4 is larger because the numbers are bigger)."
863,Believes inequalities can only include integers,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that inequalities can only be used with whole numbers (integers), and that they cannot be applied to fractions, decimals, or other types of numbers. For example, a student with this misconception may think that an inequality like 2x > 3 can only be solved if x is an integer, and may not understand that x can also be a fraction or decimal.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Solving linear inequalities like 3x + 2 > 5, where the solution may involve fractions or decimals.
* Working with inequalities involving percentages, such as 25% of x is greater than 30.
* Dealing with real-world problems that involve measurements, such as a tank that can hold more than 3.5 litres of water.
* Graphing inequalities on a number line, where the solution set may include non-integer values.
* Comparing fractions or decimals in inequalities, such as 3/4 > 2/3."
864,Reads 0 on protractor as size of angle when angle is not in usual orientation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using a protractor to measure the size of an angle, but they are not considering the orientation of the angle in relation to the protractor. They may simply read the number on the protractor where the angle's vertex touches the protractor, without checking if the angle's arms align with the protractor's zero line and the direction of the angle measurement (i.e., clockwise or counterclockwise). As a result, if the angle is not in the usual orientation (e.g., it's inverted or rotated), the student may incorrectly read the angle measure as 0 degrees, even if the actual angle size is different.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When measuring an angle that is upside down or inverted on the protractor.
* When measuring an angle that is rotated or not aligned with the protractor's zero line.
* When measuring an angle that is greater than 180 degrees, and the student doesn't understand how to use the protractor to measure reflex angles.
* When measuring an angle in a real-world context, such as measuring the angle of a roof or a slope, where the angle may not be in the usual orientation."
865,Does not recognise a unit of mass,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not understand that mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and that it is typically measured in units such as grams (g) or kilograms (kg). They may confuse mass with other physical properties like weight or volume, or they may not recognize that mass remains constant regardless of the object's location or shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the mass of different objects: Students may think that a larger object always has more mass, even if it's made of a lighter material.
- When measuring ingredients for a recipe: Students may confuse mass (e.g., 200g of flour) with volume (e.g., 200ml of water).
- When solving problems involving mass and weight: Students may assume that mass and weight are interchangeable, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When discussing the concept of density: Students may struggle to understand that density is mass per unit volume, as they do not fully grasp the concept of mass.
- When reading scales or balance readings: Students may misinterpret the units on a scale or balance, thinking that it's measuring something other than mass."
866,Believes that the y intercept is where y = 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the y-intercept in a linear equation. They mistakenly believe that the y-intercept is the point where the value of y equals 0, rather than the point where the graph of the equation crosses the y-axis. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the y-intercept and the equation of a line, or a misunderstanding of the concept of intercepts in general.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When graphing a linear equation and identifying the point where the line crosses the y-axis, students may incorrectly label the x-intercept (where the line crosses the x-axis) as the y-intercept.
* When solving linear equations, students may set y = 0 and solve for x, thinking that this will give them the y-intercept, rather than the x-intercept.
* When interpreting the graph of a linear equation, students may incorrectly identify the point where the line crosses the x-axis as the y-intercept, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between the variables.
* When writing the equation of a line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), students may incorrectly assume that the value of b (the y-intercept) is the point where y = 0, rather than the point where the line crosses the y-axis."
867,When finding the area of a parallelogram does not understand which lengths to use,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a parallelogram but get confused about which lengths to use in the formula. They might mistakenly use the lengths of the diagonals, the lengths of adjacent sides, or even the perimeter of the parallelogram. This is likely due to a lack of understanding of the properties of parallelograms and the concept of base and height. Students may also get confused between the formula for the area of a parallelogram (A = base × height) and the formula for the area of other shapes, such as rectangles or triangles.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

* When a parallelogram is drawn with its base and height labeled, but the student uses the lengths of the diagonals to calculate the area.
* When a word problem asks for the area of a parallelogram, but the student uses the perimeter to calculate the answer.
* When a student is given a parallelogram with two adjacent sides labeled, but they use these lengths as the base and height instead of finding the actual height.
* When a student is asked to find the area of a parallelogram with a given base and height, but they mistakenly use the formula for the area of a rectangle or triangle."
868,Believes a number raised to a power will always give a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students generalize the rule that any number raised to an even power results in a positive value, but they fail to consider the impact of odd powers. They may also overlook the fact that the base of the exponent can be negative. As a result, they incorrectly assume that raising any number to any power will always yield a positive result.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with odd powers of negative numbers, such as (-2)^3.
- When working with negative bases and even powers with a negative coefficient, such as -2 * (-2)^2.
- When solving algebraic expressions with exponents and variables that can take on negative values, such as (x)^3 when x = -1.
- When graphing functions with exponents and failing to consider the impact of negative x-values on the result."
869,Believes multiplying together prime factors that are not shared gives the highest common factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. They incorrectly believe that by multiplying together the prime factors that are unique to each number, they will obtain the HCF. In reality, the HCF is found by identifying the common prime factors and multiplying them together, not the unique ones.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the prime factorization of two numbers, students might focus on the factors that are different between the two numbers and multiply those together, instead of looking for the common factors.
- When dealing with numbers that have multiple prime factors, students may get confused about which factors to multiply together to find the HCF.
- In problems that involve finding the HCF of two numbers with distinct prime factors, students might mistakenly assume that the product of the unique factors is the HCF.
- When solving word problems that require finding the HCF, students may apply this misconception, leading to incorrect answers.
- In situations where students are asked to find the HCF of more than two numbers, they might incorrectly generalize this misconception, leading to further errors."
870,Only counts visible vertices,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count the number of vertices (corners) of a three-dimensional shape, such as a cube, prism, or pyramid. They may mistakenly believe that only the visible vertices, or the ones they can see, should be counted. As a result, they may overlook or ignore the hidden vertices, which are not visible from their perspective.

This misconception can arise because students may be used to working with two-dimensional shapes, where all vertices are visible. They may not fully understand that three-dimensional shapes have vertices that are not visible from every angle.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When counting the number of vertices of a cube, a student may only count the 4 vertices on the front face and ignore the 4 vertices on the back face.
- When asked to find the total number of vertices of a triangular prism, a student may only count the 3 vertices on the front face and 3 vertices on the back face, missing the 3 hidden vertices.
- When working with a square-based pyramid, a student may only count the 4 vertices on the base and the 1 vertex at the apex, ignoring the additional vertices on the sides."
871,Does not include brackets when attempting to multiply an expression,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with expressions that involve multiplication and multiple operations. They tend to overlook or forget to include brackets, which are essential in mathematics to indicate the order of operations. Without brackets, the expression can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to incorrect calculations. For example, in an expression like 3 × 2 + 4, students might not recognize the need for brackets to ensure the correct order of operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When expanding expressions like 3(2x + 1), students might write it as 3 × 2x + 1, forgetting to apply the distributive property correctly.
- When dealing with expressions like 2 × 3 + 5, students might calculate it as 2 × (3 + 5) instead of following the order of operations.
- In an expression like 4 × 2 - 3, students might not recognize the need for brackets and incorrectly calculate it as 4 × (2 - 3).
- When faced with an expression like 5 - 2 × 3, students might evaluate it as (5 - 2) × 3, ignoring the correct order of operations."
872,Thinks angles can only be measured when one line is horizontal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of angles and their measurement. They may believe that an angle can only be measured if one of its sides is perfectly horizontal, and the other side is at an inclination to it. This may be due to the way angles are often introduced in early education, where examples frequently involve a horizontal base line. As a result, students might struggle to visualize and measure angles in situations where neither side is horizontal.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Measuring the angle between two intersecting lines, neither of which is horizontal.
- Finding the angle between a roof and a wall, where the roof is not parallel to the ground.
- Calculating angles in shapes that are rotated or oriented in a non-standard way.
- Determining angles in real-world objects, like the angle between a tree branch and the trunk, where neither is horizontal.
- Measuring angles in diagrams or pictures where the lines are not aligned with the edges of the paper."
873,Believes that we cannot calculate the mean of negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that negative numbers cannot be averaged or that the concept of mean only applies to positive numbers. They may believe that the mean is only used to describe sets of data that are counts or amounts, which are typically positive. As a result, when faced with a set of data that includes negative numbers, they may think that it is impossible to calculate the mean or that the concept of mean does not apply.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the average temperature in a region that experiences temperatures below zero.
- When determining the average change in stock prices, which can include negative values for losses.
- When calculating the mean of a set of data that represents deviations from a reference point, such as the mean of a set of errors or residuals.
- When working with electrical currents or voltages, which can have negative values.
- When analyzing data from scientific experiments that involve negative measurements, such as temperatures, pressures, or energies."
874,Mistakes the place value column of hundred thousands with millions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the positional notation of numbers, particularly in the hundreds of thousands and millions place value columns. Students may mistakenly believe that the hundreds of thousands column is actually the millions column, and vice versa. This error may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationships between the different place value columns, or from difficulties with visualizing and manipulating large numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading or writing large numbers, students may incorrectly place the digits in the hundreds of thousands and millions columns, resulting in an incorrect value. For example, the number 1,234,567 might be written as 123,4567.
- When performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division with large numbers, students may incorrectly align the numbers or perform calculations with the wrong place value columns.
- When solving word problems involving large quantities, such as financial calculations or population statistics, students may misinterpret the values due to their misunderstanding of the place value columns.
- When comparing or ordering large numbers, students may incorrectly determine the larger or smaller value due to their misconception of the hundreds of thousands and millions place value columns."
875,Believes vertically opposite angles sum to 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of vertically opposite angles. They may recall that angles around a point sum to 360 degrees and incorrectly apply this rule to vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite angles are the angles formed by two lines intersecting, and students with this misconception may believe that these angles must add up to 360 degrees, rather than understanding that they are actually equal in measure.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to find the measure of a vertically opposite angle in a diagram, the student may attempt to subtract the given angle from 360 degrees.
- When solving problems involving intersecting lines, the student may incorrectly calculate the sum of the vertically opposite angles as 360 degrees.
- When asked to explain the properties of vertically opposite angles, the student may state that they sum to 360 degrees rather than recognizing that they are equal.
- When given a diagram with multiple angles labeled, the student may mistakenly identify the vertically opposite angles as supplementary angles that sum to 360 degrees rather than recognizing their equality."
876,Believes squaring a negative number just changes the sign,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to negative numbers and exponents. They might think that squaring a negative number simply changes the sign of the original number, rather than understanding that squaring a negative number actually results in a positive value. For example, students might think that (-3)^2 is equal to -9, rather than 9.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions with negative exponents, such as (-2)^2 or (-5)^4.
- When solving equations involving negative numbers and exponents, such as x^2 = -4 or x^4 = -16.
- When working with functions that involve squaring negative numbers, such as f(x) = x^2 and evaluating f(-3).
- When analyzing data that involves negative values and trying to calculate squared deviations or variances.
- When solving problems in physics or engineering that involve negative velocities or accelerations, and squaring these values to calculate energies or forces."
877,Does not convert measurements to have the same units before calculating area or volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overlook the importance of uniform units when calculating area or volume. They may incorrectly assume that as long as the numerical values are multiplied together, the result will be accurate, without considering the units of measurement. This misconception is particularly problematic because it can lead to incorrect results and misunderstandings about the actual size of the area or volume being calculated.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the area of a room, a student may multiply the length (given in meters) by the width (given in centimeters) without converting the units to be the same.
- When finding the volume of a rectangular prism, a student may multiply the length (given in inches), width (given in feet), and height (given in yards) without converting the units to a common unit.
- When comparing the areas of two different shapes, a student may not convert the measurements to the same units, leading to incorrect conclusions about which shape has the larger area.
- When solving real-world problems, such as calculating the area of a garden or the volume of a container, students may neglect to convert measurements to the same units, resulting in inaccurate results."
878,"Counts on by 1, when asked to count forward/backwards in a step other than 1","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count forward or backward by a certain number, but they incorrectly assume that they should count by 1 instead of the specified step. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of counting in different steps or intervals. 

For example, if a student is asked to count forward by 3 from 5, they might respond with 6, 7, 8, instead of the correct 8, 11, 14. Similarly, if asked to count backward by 2 from 10, they might respond with 9, 8, 7, instead of the correct 8, 6, 4.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When counting blocks or objects in a pattern, and the student is asked to extend the pattern by a certain number of blocks or objects.
- When working with number lines or hundreds charts, and the student is asked to move forward or backward by a specific number of units.
- When solving math problems that involve counting on or back by a certain number, such as ""If I have 5 pencils and I add 3 more, how many pencils do I have now?"""
879,Thinks you apply one inverse operation to one term and the other inverse operation to the other term,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving linear equations that involve multiple terms with different operations. For instance, in an equation like 2x + 3 = 7, students with this misconception might think that to isolate x, they need to apply the inverse operation of addition (subtraction) to the term ""+3"" and the inverse operation of multiplication (division) to the term ""2x"" separately, but incorrectly apply these inverses to the individual terms without properly applying the operations to both sides of the equation. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly solve equations by not correctly applying inverse operations to both sides of the equation, demonstrating a lack of understanding of how to balance equations.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Solving linear equations with multiple terms, such as 3x - 2 = 11.
- Isolating variables in equations with mixed operations, like 4x + 2 = 16.
- Simplifying algebraic expressions with multiple operations, such as 2(3x - 1) = 10."
880,Thinks a higher average means more consistent data,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a higher average value in a dataset implies that the data is more consistent or has less variability. They may think that a higher average automatically means that the data points are closer together, resulting in less spread or dispersion. However, this is not necessarily true. A higher average can be accompanied by a large range or variability in the data, while a lower average can have less variability.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Comparing exam scores - A student might think that a class with a higher average score performed more consistently than a class with a lower average score, without considering the range of scores in each class.
- Case 2: Analyzing sports performance - A student might assume that a team with a higher average score is more consistent in their performance, without looking at the variability in their scores across different games.
- Case 3: Evaluating product ratings - A student might believe that a product with a higher average rating is more consistently rated by customers, without considering the range of ratings given by different customers."
881,adds all given dimensions when calculating area,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating area. They may think that to find the area of a shape, they need to add up all the given dimensions, such as the length and width, rather than multiplying them. For example, if a rectangle has a length of 5 units and a width of 3 units, a student with this misconception might add 5 + 3 to get an area of 8 units, rather than multiplying 5 x 3 to get the correct area of 15 square units.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When calculating the area of a rectangle, a student might add the length and width instead of multiplying them.
- When finding the area of a room, a student might add the length and width of the room, rather than multiplying them.
- When solving word problems involving area, a student might misinterpret the question and add the dimensions instead of multiplying them.
- When calculating the area of a composite shape, a student might add the dimensions of each individual shape instead of finding the area of each shape and adding those together."
882,Believes 0 has no square root,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of square roots and mistakenly believe that zero does not have a square root. They may think that because zero multiplied by any number is zero, it doesn't have a corresponding square root value. However, in mathematics, every number, including zero, has a square root, which in the case of zero is simply zero itself.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions, such as √0, and students leave it as ""no solution"" or ""undefined"" instead of writing 0.
- When solving equations, like x^2 = 0, and students claim there is no solution because they believe 0 does not have a square root.
- When working with functions, such as f(x) = √x, and students incorrectly state that the function is undefined at x = 0.
- When dealing with quadratic equations and the quadratic formula, where students may incorrectly conclude that there is no solution if the discriminant is zero, which would lead to a square root of zero."
883,"Believes mirror line must lie on a grid line, not in between grid lines","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with reflections and line symmetry in geometry. They mistakenly believe that the mirror line, or line of symmetry, must always coincide with a grid line on a coordinate grid or a line on a piece of graph paper. This means they think that the mirror line cannot pass through the space between two grid lines, but rather must align perfectly with one of the horizontal or vertical lines that make up the grid.

This misconception may lead students to incorrectly identify or draw mirror lines, especially when dealing with shapes or patterns that do not neatly align with the grid. As a result, they may struggle to accurately reflect shapes or determine the line of symmetry for a given figure.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* When reflecting a shape over a line that is not a grid line, such as reflecting a triangle over a line that passes through the midpoint of two grid squares.
* When identifying the line of symmetry for a shape that does not have its vertices on grid points, such as a circle or an irregular polygon.
* When working with real-world examples, such as art or architecture, where symmetry is used but does not necessarily align with a grid system."
884,"When asked for more, find the total","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find ""more"" or ""extra"" of something, but instead, they find the total. They might misunderstand the concept of ""more"" as adding to the initial amount to find the new total, rather than just finding the additional amount. 

For example:

- If Sara has 5 pencils and her friend gives her 2 more, and the question asks, ""How many more pencils did Sara get?"", students with this misconception might answer 7 (the total number of pencils Sara now has) instead of 2 (the additional pencils she received).
- If a toy costs $8 and the price increases by $2, and the question asks, ""How much more does the toy cost now?"", students with this misconception might answer $10 (the new total price) instead of $2 (the price increase).
- If a water tank can hold 50 liters of water and 20 more liters are added, and the question asks, ""How much more water is in the tank?"", students with this misconception might answer 70 (the new total amount of water) instead of 20 (the additional water added)."
885,Thinks they can simplify algebraic fractions by cancelling unlike variables,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rules of simplifying numerical fractions to algebraic fractions. They might mistakenly believe that they can cancel out variables in the numerator and denominator, even if they are not the same, to simplify the fraction. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental rules of algebra and the properties of variables.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying fractions with variables, such as (2x)/(3y), students might incorrectly cancel out the x and y variables.
- When dealing with expressions like (x + 2)/(x + 3), students might try to cancel out the x's in the numerator and denominator.
- When simplifying algebraic expressions like (2x^2)/(3x), students might incorrectly cancel out the x's, without considering the effect of the exponent."
886,Believes that prime numbers cannot be even,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to prime numbers and they are given examples of prime numbers that are odd, such as 3, 5, and 7. They may generalize this pattern and assume that all prime numbers are odd, therefore believing that even numbers cannot be prime. This misconception may be reinforced if the definition of prime numbers is not clearly explained, or if students are not exposed to the exception of the even prime number 2.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When students are asked to identify prime numbers from a list and they exclude the number 2 because it is even.
* When students are asked to generate a list of prime numbers and they only include odd numbers.
* When students are solving problems that involve prime numbers and they incorrectly assume that an even number cannot be prime, leading to incorrect solutions."
887,"When using interpolation to estimate frequency, assumes half the frequency of the class containing the value will be above/below it, even if it is not the midpoint","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using interpolation to estimate the frequency of a value within a class interval in a grouped data set. Interpolation involves making an educated guess about the frequency of a value that falls within a class interval by assuming that the values are evenly distributed within that interval. 

However, some students mistakenly believe that when using interpolation, half of the frequency of the class interval will always be above the value and half will be below it, regardless of where the value actually falls within the interval. This assumption is only correct if the value is exactly at the midpoint of the interval, but not necessarily if it is closer to one end or the other.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly estimate the frequency of a value, which can affect the accuracy of their calculations and conclusions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Estimating the median or quartiles of a dataset from a cumulative frequency graph.
- Finding the estimated frequency of a specific value within a class interval in a histogram or frequency table.
- Using interpolation to estimate the value of a percentile or decile from a grouped dataset."
888,Does not understand the relationship between a ratio and fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that ratios and fractions are related concepts. They might view ratios as simply a comparison of two numbers, without realizing that ratios can be expressed as fractions, and vice versa. Students may not understand that a ratio of a:b can be written as the fraction a/b, and that the fraction a/b can also be expressed as the ratio a:b. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties when working with equivalent ratios, simplifying ratios, and applying ratios to real-world problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the number of boys to girls in a class, a student might write the ratio as 10:15, but struggle to express this as a fraction (10/15) or simplify it (2/3).
- When scaling a recipe, a student might be given a ratio of ingredients, such as 2:3 for sugar to flour, but have trouble converting this to a fraction (2/3) to determine the amount of flour needed for a specific amount of sugar.
- When working with equivalent ratios, a student might not recognize that the ratios 2:3 and 4:6 are equivalent, and that they can be expressed as the same fraction (2/3)."
889,"Believes when you plot a sequence, the line always passes through (0, 0)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students assume that all sequences or linear relationships have a direct proportional relationship that starts from the origin, (0, 0). They may believe that every time a sequence is plotted on a coordinate plane, the resulting line will always pass through the point (0, 0), indicating that when the input or independent variable is 0, the output or dependent variable is also 0.

This misconception may stem from early experiences with simple proportional relationships, such as the cost of items being directly proportional to the number of items purchased, or the distance traveled being directly proportional to the time traveled at a constant speed. In these cases, if there are no initial costs or initial distances, the line representing the relationship may indeed pass through (0, 0).

However, not all sequences or linear relationships have this characteristic. Some sequences may have a non-zero starting point or a non-zero intercept, meaning that the line representing the relationship does not pass through (0, 0).

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- When plotting a sequence of temperatures over time, a student may assume that the line will pass through (0, 0), even if the temperature was not 0 degrees at the start of the measurement.
- When analyzing the relationship between the number of hours worked and the total pay, a student may assume that the line will pass through (0, 0), even if there is a fixed initial payment or benefit.
- When modeling population growth over time, a student may assume that the line will pass through (0, 0), even if the initial population was not 0."
890,Thinks they had to give the new amount rather than the total percentage that the original has been increased by.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to calculate the percentage increase of a quantity, but instead of finding the percentage change, they calculate the new amount after the increase. They may add the increase to the original amount and provide the new total, rather than calculating the percentage increase as a proportion of the original amount.

For example, if the original price of an item is £50 and it is increased to £60, students with this misconception may answer £60 (the new amount) instead of 20% (the percentage increase).

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Calculating the percentage increase in the price of a product.
- Finding the percentage change in the number of items sold.
- Determining the percentage growth of a population over time.
- Calculating the percentage increase in the area or volume of a shape.

In each of these cases, students with this misconception may provide the new amount or value instead of the percentage change, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the concept of percentage increase."
891,Incorrectly cancels what they believe is a factor in algebraic fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe they can cancel out terms or factors in algebraic fractions that appear to be the same, but are not actually equivalent. They may treat variables and constants as if they can be canceled out in the same way as common factors in numerical fractions. This often happens when students are not fully understanding the properties of algebraic expressions, such as the distributive property or the concept of equivalent ratios.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Canceling a variable with a coefficient: Students may try to cancel a variable (e.g., 'x') with a coefficient (e.g., '2x') thinking that the 'x' terms will cancel out, when in fact, the coefficient affects the value of the variable.
- Case 2: Canceling unlike terms: Students might cancel out unlike terms in the numerator and denominator, such as canceling an 'x' term in the numerator with a 'y' term in the denominator, not realizing that these terms are not equivalent.
- Case 3: Canceling terms that are not factors: Students may attempt to cancel out terms that appear to be the same, but are not actually factors of the expression. For example, canceling an 'x' term in the numerator when it is part of a larger expression (e.g., 'x + 2')."
892,Believes each vertical line on a box plot represents 1 piece of data,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the purpose and construction of a box plot. They may think that each vertical line or mark on the box plot represents an individual data point, rather than understanding that the lines and marks represent specific statistical measures, such as the median, quartiles, and outliers. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly interpret the data, thinking that there are more data points than there actually are, or that the data is more spread out than it really is.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to create a box plot from a given dataset and they draw a vertical line for each data point.
- When students are interpreting a box plot and they count the number of vertical lines to determine the number of data points.
- When students are comparing two box plots and they conclude that one dataset has more data points than the other based on the number of vertical lines.
- When students are asked to identify outliers on a box plot and they mistakenly identify every vertical line as an individual data point."
893,"Believes when changing an improper fraction to a mixed number you divide the numerator by 10, regardless of the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the process of converting an improper fraction to a mixed number involves dividing the numerator by a fixed number, in this case, 10, instead of dividing by the actual denominator. They may have misinterpreted or misremembered the instructions or examples provided in class or in their textbooks.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When converting an improper fraction with a denominator other than 10, e.g., 25/4 or 17/3.
- When dealing with fractions that have denominators that are multiples of 10, but not exactly 10, e.g., 45/20 or 75/30.
- When working with word problems that involve converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, e.g., measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a quantity into equal parts.
- When simplifying complex fractions or comparing fractions with different denominators."
894,Believes expanding a squared expression means writing it as a set of double brackets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of expanding squared expressions in algebra. They believe that when a binomial (an expression with two terms) is squared, it simply means writing the expression twice in brackets, side by side, rather than applying the correct expansion formula. 

For example, if asked to expand (x + 3)^2, a student with this misconception might write (x + 3)(x + 3) as the expansion, but not actually multiply the terms out to get x^2 + 6x + 9.

This misconception will likely occur in cases such as:

- Expanding squared expressions with two terms: (x + y)^2, (a - b)^2
- Simplifying expressions like (2x + 1)^2
- Applying algebraic identities like (a + b)^2 = ?"
895,Believes a line of reflection must be touching the original shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a line of reflection must be physically touching or connected to the original shape in order for the reflection to occur. They may think that the line of reflection is a physical boundary that the shape must be in contact with, rather than understanding that it is a theoretical line that serves as a perpendicular bisector of the line segment connecting corresponding points on the original shape and its reflection.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to draw the line of reflection for a given shape and its reflection, they may insist on drawing the line so that it is touching the original shape, rather than understanding that it can be anywhere as long as it is the perpendicular bisector.
* When students are given a shape and asked to reflect it over a given line, they may incorrectly assume that the line must be touching the shape in order for the reflection to be valid.
* When students are solving problems involving reflections in real-world contexts, such as reflecting a shape over a mirror line, they may mistakenly believe that the mirror line must be physically touching the shape in order for the reflection to occur."
896,"When adding fractions with identical numerators, leaves the numerator and adds the denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to add fractions with the same numerators but different denominators. They mistakenly assume that since the numerators are the same, they can simply add the denominators together, resulting in an incorrect answer. For example, when adding 1/4 and 1/6, students with this misconception would leave the numerator as 1 and add the denominators to get 1/10. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions and the need to find a common denominator when adding fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Adding 1/8 and 1/12 to get 1/20
- Adding 2/6 and 2/8 to get 2/14
- Adding 3/10 and 3/15 to get 3/25
- Adding 1/3 and 1/5 to get 1/8"
897,Does not recognise an example of the alternate segment theorem,"Explanation: The alternate segment theorem is a concept in geometry that states that the angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. However, some students may not recognize examples of the alternate segment theorem, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the theorem itself or difficulty in identifying the relevant angles in a given diagram.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a diagram is not drawn to scale, making it difficult for students to identify the relevant angles.
- When the chord or tangent is not clearly labeled, causing students to misinterpret the given information.
- When the problem involves multiple angles and segments, leading to confusion in identifying the correct alternate segment.
- When the theorem is applied to a more complex shape, such as a circle with multiple tangents or chords.
- When the problem requires students to find a missing angle using the alternate segment theorem, but the given information is not explicitly stated."
898,Thinks x = 0 is the x axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the equation x = 0 represents the entire x-axis on a coordinate plane. In reality, the x-axis is a horizontal line where y = 0, and x can take any value. Students with this misconception may think that any point on the x-axis has an x-coordinate of 0, rather than understanding that x can vary while y remains constant at 0.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing linear equations, students may incorrectly label the x-axis as x = 0, rather than y = 0.
- When solving systems of equations, students may mistakenly substitute x = 0 into an equation, thinking it represents the x-axis.
- When finding x-intercepts of a function, students may incorrectly assume that the x-intercept is always at x = 0, rather than finding the actual value of x where the function crosses the x-axis."
899,Does not recognise parallel lines angle rules,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not understand that when two lines are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal, the alternate interior angles are equal, and the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees). They may believe that the angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal are unrelated or have a different relationship.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Believing that corresponding angles are not equal, and instead thinking that they are supplementary or have no relationship.
* Not recognizing that alternate interior angles are equal, and instead thinking that they are supplementary or have no relationship.
* Not understanding that interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary, and instead thinking that they are equal or have no relationship.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to find the measure of an angle in a diagram with parallel lines and a transversal, a student with this misconception may not use the correct angle relationships to solve the problem.
* When given a statement about parallel lines and angles, such as ""If two lines are parallel, then corresponding angles are equal,"" a student with this misconception may not recognize the statement as true or may not understand the implications of the statement.
* When working on a geometry problem that involves parallel lines and angles, a student with this misconception may become confused or make incorrect assumptions about the relationships between the angles."
900,Believes the constant gives the y-intercept even when a line is not written in the form y = mx + c,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the slope-intercept form of a linear equation (y = mx + c), where 'c' represents the y-intercept. They tend to generalize this concept and believe that the constant term in any linear equation represents the y-intercept, regardless of the form of the equation. This means that even if the equation is written in a different form, such as the general form (ax + by = d) or the standard form (ax + by = c), students with this misconception will incorrectly identify the constant term as the y-intercept.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When the equation is written in the general form (ax + by = d) and the student identifies 'd' as the y-intercept.
- When the equation is written in the standard form (ax + by = c) and the student identifies 'c' as the y-intercept without rearranging the equation to the slope-intercept form.
- When the equation has a constant term on the right-hand side, but it is not in the form y = mx + c, such as x + 2y = 3, and the student assumes the constant term '3' is the y-intercept."
901,Finds unit price but doesn't multiply up for number in question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are able to calculate the unit price of an item, but fail to multiply it by the quantity required to find the total cost. They understand the concept of finding the price per unit, but they don't apply it to the specific problem at hand, which requires them to find the total cost for a certain number of units.

For example:

* Case 1: A book costs £5 per copy, and a student is asked to find the cost of 3 books. The student calculates the unit price (£5) but doesn't multiply it by 3, giving an incorrect answer of £5 instead of £15.
* Case 2: A bakery sells a pack of 6 cookies for £2. A student is asked to find the cost of 18 cookies. The student calculates the unit price (£2 ÷ 6 = £0.33 per cookie) but doesn't multiply it by 18, giving an incorrect answer of £0.33 instead of £6.
* Case 3: A car travels 25 miles per gallon of fuel, and fuel costs £1.20 per gallon. A student is asked to find the cost of fuel for a 75-mile journey. The student calculates the unit price (£1.20 per gallon) and the number of gallons required (75 miles ÷ 25 miles per gallon = 3 gallons), but doesn't multiply the unit price by the number of gallons, giving an incorrect answer of £1.20 instead of £3.60."
902,Thinks 1 squared is 2,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of squaring a number. They might think that squaring a number means adding 1 to the number or doubling it, rather than multiplying the number by itself. In the case of 1 squared, they incorrectly assume the result is 2, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the operation or a lack of understanding of the concept of squaring as repeated multiplication.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When students are first introduced to the concept of squaring numbers and are asked to calculate 1 squared.
- When students are solving simple algebraic equations, such as x^2 = 1, and mistakenly think the solution is x = 2.
- When students are working with geometric shapes, such as finding the area of a square with a side length of 1 unit, and incorrectly calculate the area as 2 square units."
903,"Has increased by the value of the first value, rather than the difference","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating percentage increases or comparing changes in values. They mistakenly believe that when a value increases, it has increased by the value of the original amount, rather than by the difference between the original and new amounts. For example, if a shirt originally costs $10 and the price increases to $15, students with this misconception might think the price has increased by 100% of the original value ($10), rather than by 50% ($5, the difference between $10 and $15).

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Calculating percentage increases: If a book originally costs $20 and the price increases to $30, a student might say it increased by 100% (thinking it doubled), instead of by 50% (the actual increase).
2. Comparing changes in values: If a person's height increases from 150cm to 160cm, a student might say it increased by 150% (thinking it increased by the original height), instead of by 6.67% (the actual increase).
3. Analyzing data: When analyzing data on changes in population or sales, students might misinterpret the increases as being greater than they actually are, leading to incorrect conclusions."
904,Has taken the percentage from the original ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating successive percentage changes, such as calculating a percentage increase followed by another percentage increase, or a percentage decrease followed by another percentage decrease. They mistakenly apply the second percentage change to the original value, rather than the new value after the first percentage change.

For example, if a product is initially priced at $100 and has a 20% discount, followed by another 10% discount, students with this misconception may calculate the second discount as 10% of the original price ($100), rather than 10% of the discounted price ($80). 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Calculating the final price of a product after successive discounts.
- Determining the final amount of money in a savings account after multiple interest rate changes.
- Finding the final measurement of an object after multiple percentage changes in its size."
905,"Thinks the movement of the top number in a column vector is vertical, and the bottom number is horizontal rather than the other way round","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to column vectors in mathematics, particularly in the context of geometry and movement in a 2D plane. They mistakenly believe that the top number in a column vector represents vertical movement (up or down) and the bottom number represents horizontal movement (left or right). In reality, the top number should represent horizontal movement, and the bottom number should represent vertical movement.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to describe the movement of an object using column vectors, they might swap the directions of the movements.
- When solving problems involving vector addition or subtraction, students might add or subtract the components incorrectly due to their misconception about the direction each component represents.
- When graphing vectors on a coordinate plane, students might plot the points incorrectly, leading to incorrect representations of the movement or position described by the vector.
- When solving problems involving the magnitude and direction of vectors, students might calculate these values incorrectly due to their misunderstanding of the components' directions."
906,Does not know that sample size affects reliability,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the size of a sample does not impact the reliability or accuracy of the conclusions drawn from it. They may think that as long as they have some data, it doesn't matter how many data points they have, and that the results will be equally reliable. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between sample size and the reliability of statistical results.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student conducts a survey to determine the favorite food of students in their school and only asks 5 friends, assuming that the results will accurately represent the entire student body.
- Case 2: A student collects data on the effect of a new fertilizer on plant growth by testing it on only 2 plants, and then concludes that the fertilizer is effective for all plants.
- Case 3: A student analyzes the average height of students in their class using data from only 3 students and assumes that the result is representative of the entire class."
907,Does not find a common denominator when adding/subtracting fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. They tend to add or subtract the numerators (the numbers on top) without considering the denominators (the numbers on the bottom), or they simply add or subtract the denominators without finding a common base. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions and the need for a common denominator to perform operations with fractions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When adding fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6.
- When subtracting fractions with different denominators, e.g., 3/8 - 1/6.
- When comparing fractions with different denominators to determine which one is larger or smaller, e.g., 3/4 and 2/3.
- When solving word problems involving fractions, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza among friends."
908,"When adding or subtracting surds, believes the numbers under the root and the numbers in front should both be added or subtracted","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with surds, which are numbers expressed as the square root of another number. Students may believe that when adding or subtracting surds, they need to add or subtract both the numbers under the root sign (radicands) and the numbers in front of the root sign (coefficients) separately. For example, when adding 2√3 and 3√4, they may think they should add the numbers under the root (3 + 4) and the numbers in front (2 + 3) separately, resulting in an incorrect answer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Adding 2√5 and 4√7, where the student may add 5 and 7, and then add 2 and 4.
- Subtracting 3√2 from 5√3, where the student may subtract 2 from 3, and then subtract 3 from 5.
- Simplifying an expression like 2√3 + 2√5, where the student may add 3 and 5, and then multiply the result by 2 + 2."
909,Mixes up squaring with dividing by 2,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number (i.e., multiplying it by itself) is equivalent to dividing the number by 2. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the fundamental concept of squaring numbers.

For example, when asked to find the value of 6 squared (6²), a student with this misconception may incorrectly divide 6 by 2, resulting in an answer of 3, rather than the correct answer of 36.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: When simplifying expressions like (3x)², students may incorrectly divide 3x by 2 instead of multiplying it by itself.
2. Area calculations: When finding the area of a square or rectangle, students may mistakenly divide the side length by 2 instead of squaring it.
3. Solving equations: In equations like x² = 16, students may incorrectly divide x by 2 instead of finding the square root of 16.
4. Word problems: In word problems involving area or volume, students may misinterpret the problem and divide a value by 2 instead of squaring it, leading to incorrect solutions."
910,Cannot identify the correct side lengths to use when asked to find the area of a face,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to determine the correct side lengths to use when calculating the area of a specific face of a three-dimensional shape. They may confuse the different dimensions of the shape, such as the length, width, and height, or incorrectly identify the sides that form the face for which they are trying to find the area.

This misconception can occur in various situations, including:

- When dealing with rectangular prisms, students might mistakenly use the length and height instead of the length and width to find the area of the front face.
- When working with triangular prisms, students may incorrectly identify the base and height of the triangular face, leading to an incorrect calculation of the area.
- When finding the area of a face of a cube, students might confuse the different side lengths, which are all equal, and use the wrong dimensions to calculate the area.
- When calculating the surface area of a shape, students may incorrectly identify the side lengths to use for each face, leading to an incorrect total surface area."
911,Only multiplies the numerical terms when expanding a bracket,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to expanding brackets in algebra. They may incorrectly believe that only the numerical terms outside the bracket need to be multiplied with the terms inside the bracket, ignoring any algebraic terms (such as variables) that are also being multiplied. 

For example, when expanding 2(x + 3), students with this misconception might correctly multiply 2 by the constant term 3, but fail to multiply 2 by the variable term x, resulting in an incomplete expansion.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Expanding 3(2x + 1), where students might multiply 3 by 1 but not by 2x.
2. Expanding x(2 + 4), where students might not multiply x by both terms inside the bracket.
3. Expanding 2(3x - 4), where students might multiply 2 by -4 but not by 3x."
912,Thinks adding the same value to each side makes shapes similar,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that by adding the same value to each side of a shape, the resulting shape will be similar to the original shape. They may think that as long as the same number is added to each side, the shape's proportions and angles will remain the same, making it similar. However, this is not the case. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are working with scale drawings and mistakenly believe that adding the same value to each side will maintain the shape's proportions.
- When exploring the concept of similarity in geometry and think that adding a fixed value to each side will preserve the shape's angles and proportions.
- When solving problems involving enlargements or reductions of shapes and incorrectly assume that adding the same value to each side will result in a similar shape.
- When comparing the perimeters or areas of similar shapes and incorrectly believe that adding the same value to each side will maintain their similarity."
913,Believes the numerator stays the same when calculating a second pick of the same type without replacement on a tree diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with probability problems, specifically with tree diagrams, and they are asked to find the probability of two or more events happening without replacement. They mistakenly believe that the numerator (number of favorable outcomes) remains the same for the second pick, even though the total number of outcomes has changed due to the removal of one item.

For instance, let's consider a scenario where a student is asked to find the probability of picking two red balls from a bag containing 5 red balls and 3 blue balls without replacement. They may correctly calculate the probability of picking the first red ball, but when calculating the probability of picking the second red ball, they will use the same numerator (5) instead of adjusting it to reflect the fact that one red ball has already been removed.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Picking two cards of the same suit from a deck without replacement
* Selecting two students of the same gender from a group without replacement
* Choosing two items of the same color from a bag without replacement"
914,Finds 10% of an amount rather than the percentage being asked,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a specific percentage of an amount, but instead, they mistakenly find 10% of the amount and either add or subtract it to get their answer, or multiply the 10% by a factor to get the desired percentage. They may struggle to apply the concept of percentages to different proportions, leading them to rely on the easier calculation of 10%. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding 5% or 20% of an amount, the student might find 10% first and then halve or double it.
- When calculating a percentage increase or decrease, the student may find 10% of the original amount and add or subtract it to get their answer, regardless of the actual percentage change.
- When comparing the value of different percentage changes (e.g., 15% vs 25%), the student may incorrectly assume that the difference between the two percentages is 10% more or less, rather than understanding the actual proportional difference."
915,Does not recognise metres as a unit of length,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify metres as a standard unit of measurement for length or distance. They may be familiar with other units such as centimetres, millimetres, or even non-standard units like hand spans or paces, but fail to understand that metres are a fundamental unit of length in the metric system.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When asked to measure the length of a room or a long object, the student may respond with an answer in a different unit, like centimetres or yards.
- When given a measurement in metres, the student may not be able to visualise or understand the actual length being described.
- When solving problems that involve converting between units of length, the student may struggle to convert metres to or from other units.
- When asked to estimate the length of an object or distance, the student may not be able to use metres as a reference point.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to measure the length of a classroom and responds with an answer in centimetres (e.g., 1,200 cm) instead of metres (e.g., 12 m).
- Case 2: A student is given a problem that involves converting 5 metres to centimetres and struggles to perform the conversion.
- Case 3: A student is asked to estimate the length of a football field and responds with an answer in yards or feet instead of metres."
916,Thinks the fraction bar means multiply rather than divide,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the fraction bar (the line separating the numerator and denominator in a fraction) as a symbol for multiplication rather than division. As a result, they mistakenly multiply the numerator by the denominator instead of dividing the numerator by the denominator.

For example, when given the fraction 1/2, students with this misconception may think it means 1 multiplied by 2, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2 instead of 0.5.

Short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When simplifying fractions (e.g., 4/2)
- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators (e.g., 1/2 + 1/3)
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions (e.g., 2 1/3)
- When dividing fractions by other fractions (e.g., 1/2 ÷ 1/3)
- When solving word problems involving fractions (e.g., ""Tom has 1/2 of a pizza and his friend has 1/3 of a pizza. How much pizza do they have in total?"")"
917,Believes every direct or inverse proportion question uses the formula p=kq,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to direct and inverse proportionality and learn the formulas p = kq for direct proportion and p = k/q for inverse proportion. They may mistakenly assume that every problem involving direct or inverse proportion will use the formula p = kq. They might overlook the fact that inverse proportion uses a different formula, or that some problems might require a more nuanced approach. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases: 

- When solving problems involving inverse proportionality, students may incorrectly apply the direct proportion formula p = kq instead of the correct inverse proportion formula p = k/q. 
- In problems involving compound proportions or multiple variables, students might insist on using the p = kq formula, even when it's not applicable. 
- When working with real-world problems that require an understanding of proportionality, students might default to the p = kq formula without considering the context and the specific relationship between the variables."
918,Confuses x and y axes,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the x-axis and y-axis in a coordinate plane. They may incorrectly label or identify the axes, which can lead to errors in graphing, interpreting data, and understanding relationships between variables. Students may struggle to remember that the x-axis typically represents the horizontal axis (left-right) and the y-axis represents the vertical axis (up-down). This confusion can be exacerbated by the fact that the x-axis is often associated with the independent variable and the y-axis with the dependent variable, which can be a difficult concept for some students to grasp.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When graphing a function, a student plots the x values on the y-axis and vice versa.
- When reading a graph, a student incorrectly identifies the x-intercept as the y-intercept or vice versa.
- When creating a coordinate grid, a student labels the x-axis as the y-axis and vice versa.
- When working with real-world data, a student confuses the independent variable (x-axis) with the dependent variable (y-axis).
- When interpreting a scatter plot, a student incorrectly identifies the relationship between the variables due to a mix-up between the x and y axes."
919,Believes the gradient of a speed-time graph is the distance,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the information presented on a speed-time graph. They mistakenly believe that the gradient (slope) of the graph represents the distance traveled, rather than understanding what the gradient actually represents in the context of a speed-time graph.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to analyze the motion of an object using a speed-time graph, they might incorrectly calculate the distance traveled by finding the gradient of the graph.
- In problems where students are given a speed-time graph and asked to determine the distance traveled over a certain period, they might mistakenly use the gradient to calculate the distance.
- When comparing the motion of different objects using speed-time graphs, students might incorrectly conclude that the object with the steeper gradient has traveled a greater distance.
- In situations where students are asked to identify the time at which an object was traveling at a certain speed, they might mistakenly use the gradient to determine the distance traveled up to that point."
920,Believes that the cumulative frequency of an interval of grouped data can be used as the cumulative frequency for any value in that interval,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of cumulative frequency in grouped data. They believe that the cumulative frequency of an interval can be applied to any value within that interval, without considering the actual distribution of data within the interval. This means that they assume the cumulative frequency remains constant throughout the interval, which is not the case.

For example, consider a dataset of exam scores grouped into intervals of 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and so on. If the cumulative frequency for the interval 21-30 is 50, students with this misconception might assume that the cumulative frequency for a score of 22 is also 50, and for a score of 28 is also 50. They fail to recognize that the actual cumulative frequency may vary within the interval, depending on the specific distribution of scores.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Interpreting histograms or frequency tables with grouped data
- Calculating cumulative frequencies or percentages for specific values within an interval
- Comparing the distribution of data across different intervals or groups
- Determining the median or quartiles of a dataset with grouped data
- Solving problems involving the probability of a value falling within a certain interval."
921,Reads the wrong scale on the protractor when measuring acute angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are using a protractor to measure acute angles, but they mistakenly read the scale for obtuse angles (usually the outer scale) instead of the scale for acute angles (usually the inner scale). As a result, they may record an angle measurement that is significantly larger than the actual measurement.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When measuring the angle of a triangle, a student may place the protractor on the angle and read the outer scale, which shows an angle of 120°, instead of the inner scale, which shows the correct angle of 60°.
2. In a geometry exercise, a student is asked to measure the acute angle formed by two intersecting lines. They use a protractor and mistakenly read the outer scale, recording an angle of 150° instead of the correct angle of 30°.
3. When constructing a shape with specific angle measurements, a student may use a protractor to measure an acute angle, but reads the wrong scale, resulting in an incorrect angle measurement that affects the overall shape of the construction."
922,Believes we can only take the square root of a perfect square,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of square roots and are initially only shown examples of perfect squares, such as √16 = 4 and √25 = 5. As a result, they may assume that square roots can only be taken of numbers that have a whole number square root. They may struggle to understand that square roots can be taken of any positive number, including decimals and non-perfect squares.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When asked to simplify √2 or √3, students may say it's impossible because they are not perfect squares.
* When solving equations like x = √5, students may say there is no solution because 5 is not a perfect square.
* When working with real-world applications, such as finding the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, students may struggle to understand that the result can be a non-perfect square."
923,Thinks index notation represents repeated addition rather than repeated multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the index notation, such as 2^3, as 2 + 2 + 2 instead of 2 * 2 * 2. They may understand the concept of indices as simply adding a number a certain number of times, rather than raising it to a power through repeated multiplication.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When introducing index notation for the first time, students may confuse it with repeated addition, as they may have previously learned about multiplication as repeated addition.
- When dealing with small indices, such as 2^2 or 3^2, students may mistakenly calculate the result as 2 + 2 or 3 + 3, rather than 2 * 2 or 3 * 3.
- When solving problems involving indices with the same base, such as 2^3 + 2^2, students may incorrectly combine the terms using addition instead of calculating each separately and then adding the results.
- When simplifying expressions with indices, such as (2^2) * (2^3), students may misunderstand the application of the index rule and add the indices instead of multiplying the terms."
924,Believes to find the proportion of a pie chart sector you do frequency/sum of other frequencies rather than frequency/overall total,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of proportion in the context of a pie chart. They incorrectly believe that to find the proportion of a sector in a pie chart, they need to divide the frequency of that sector by the sum of the frequencies of all the other sectors, rather than dividing the frequency of that sector by the overall total of all frequencies.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the proportion of students who prefer a particular subject in a class, and they divide the number of students who prefer that subject by the total number of students who prefer other subjects.
- When analyzing data on the number of hours spent on different activities, students may divide the hours spent on one activity by the total hours spent on all other activities to find the proportion of time spent on that activity.
- In a survey of favorite colors, students may calculate the proportion of people who like a particular color by dividing the number of people who like that color by the total number of people who like other colors."
925,Believes the gradients of perpendicular lines are reciprocals of the same sign,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand that the gradients of perpendicular lines are related to each other but mistakenly believe that the relationship is simply a reciprocal one, without considering the change in sign. They may think that if the gradient of one line is 'm', the gradient of a line perpendicular to it is '1/m', without recognizing the need for a negative sign in the reciprocal.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, students may write the gradient of the perpendicular line as a positive reciprocal of the original gradient.
- When identifying whether two lines are perpendicular based on their gradients, students may incorrectly conclude that lines with gradients that are positive reciprocals of each other are perpendicular.
- When graphing lines and trying to draw a line perpendicular to a given line, students may use the incorrect gradient, resulting in a line that is not actually perpendicular.
- When solving problems involving the intersection of two perpendicular lines, students may use the incorrect relationship between the gradients, leading to incorrect solutions."
926,Believes the number of sides gives the order of rotational symmetry,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number of sides of a shape is directly related to its order of rotational symmetry. They may think that if a shape has 'n' sides, it must have 'n' orders of rotational symmetry. This means that they assume a shape can be rotated 'n' times to return to its original position, with each rotation being an equal fraction of a full turn.

For example:

- A student may think that a hexagon (6 sides) has 6 orders of rotational symmetry because it has 6 sides.
- A student may believe that an octagon (8 sides) has 8 orders of rotational symmetry.
- A student may assume that a triangle (3 sides) has 3 orders of rotational symmetry.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly determine the order of rotational symmetry for various shapes, failing to consider the actual symmetry properties of the shape."
927,Assumes that opposite angles in a quadrilateral sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the property of angles in triangles to quadrilaterals. They may recall that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees and mistakenly assume that opposite angles in a quadrilateral also sum to 180 degrees, not realizing that the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is actually 360 degrees.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the missing angle in a quadrilateral, students may incorrectly calculate the missing angle by subtracting the given angle from 180 degrees.
- When determining if a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, students may incorrectly assume that if opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, then the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral, students may incorrectly apply the formula for the sum of angles in a triangle, leading to incorrect calculations."
928,Divides when converting to a larger unit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when converting a measurement from a smaller unit to a larger unit, they need to divide the value. For example, when converting 1000 grams to kilograms, students may think they need to divide 1000 by a certain number to get the correct value in kilograms. This misconception arises from a lack of understanding of the relationships between different units and the concept of conversion factors.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 1500 milliliters to liters, a student may divide 1500 by a certain number instead of recognizing that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters.
- Converting 2500 meters to kilometers, a student may attempt to divide 2500 by a certain number instead of recognizing that 1 kilometer is equal to 1000 meters.
- Converting 500 grams to kilograms, a student may divide 500 by a certain number instead of recognizing that 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams."
929,"When using the capture-recapture method of sampling, believes you add the number marked first to the number caught second and add that to the number marked second to get the best estimate of population size","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the principle behind the capture-recapture method, which is used to estimate the size of a population. They incorrectly believe that simply adding the number of individuals initially marked to the number caught during the second sampling, and then adding the number marked during the second sampling, will provide an accurate estimate of the population size. This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of the method's underlying assumptions and calculations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is tasked with estimating the population size of a fish species in a lake. They catch 50 fish, mark them, and release them. During the second sampling, they catch 75 fish, including 20 marked ones. The student incorrectly estimates the population size by adding 50 (initially marked) + 75 (caught during the second sampling) + 20 (marked during the second sampling).

- Case 2: In a field study, students are asked to estimate the population size of a specific type of insect. They capture 30 insects, mark them, and release them. During the second capture, they catch 40 insects, including 10 marked ones. The student mistakenly calculates the population size by adding 30 (initially marked) + 40 (caught during the second sampling) + 10 (marked during the second sampling).

- Case 3: A student is conducting a research project to estimate the population size of a particular bird species. They capture 20 birds, mark them, and release them. During the second capture, they catch 35 birds, including 15 marked ones. The student incorrectly estimates the population size by adding 20 (initially marked) + 35 (caught during the second sampling) + 15 (marked during the second sampling)."
930,When solving simultaneous equations thinks that identical terms in given equations can be eliminated by either adding or subtracting.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of solving simultaneous equations using the method of elimination. They might misunderstand the idea that identical terms can be eliminated by either adding or subtracting, without considering the signs and coefficients of those terms. They may think that simply because the terms look the same (e.g., both have an 'x' or both have a 'y'), they can be eliminated, regardless of whether they are on the same side of the equation or have the same coefficient.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When both equations have the same variable with the same coefficient, but on opposite sides of the equation (e.g., 2x + 3y = 5 and 2x - 4 = 3y).
* When both equations have the same variable, but with different coefficients (e.g., x + 2y = 4 and 2x + 3y = 7).
* When both equations have the same constant term, but with different signs (e.g., x + y = 3 and x - y = -3).
* When students try to eliminate a variable by adding or subtracting the equations without checking if the coefficients are the same (e.g., 2x + 3y = 5 and x + 2y = 3)."
931,Does not understand where to place inputs/ operations/ outputs when drawing a function machine,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to represent a function or a mathematical relationship using a function machine diagram. They may struggle to correctly identify where the inputs, operations, and outputs should be placed within the diagram.

In a function machine, the input is the value that is being transformed or operated on, the operation is the process being applied to the input, and the output is the resulting value. However, students may confuse the placement of these components, leading to incorrect representations of the function.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Placing the operation before the input, implying that the operation is being applied to nothing.
* Swapping the input and output, suggesting that the output is being used as the starting value.
* Including unnecessary or redundant components, such as multiple inputs or operations that are not relevant to the function.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A student is asked to draw a function machine that represents the equation 2x + 3. They may incorrectly place the ""+3"" before the input ""x"", rather than after the multiplication operation.
* Case 2: A student is given a function machine with a single input and two operations. They may confuse the order of the operations, placing the second operation before the first.
* Case 3: A student is asked to create a function machine that takes a number as input and outputs its double. They may incorrectly label the input as the output, and vice versa."
932,Adds instead of multiplies when calculating total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add the frequencies of individual groups or categories instead of multiplying the frequency of a single group or category by the number of groups or categories. This can lead to incorrect calculations of total frequency, especially in situations where groups have the same frequency.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When calculating the total number of items in multiple identical sets, students may add the number of items in one set to itself instead of multiplying.
- When finding the total frequency of an event that occurs multiple times at the same rate, students may add the frequencies instead of multiplying the frequency by the number of occurrences.
- In data analysis, when combining multiple groups with the same frequency, students may incorrectly add the frequencies instead of multiplying the frequency by the number of groups."
933,Does not know the meaning of corresponding,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to understand the concept of ""corresponding"" in mathematics, particularly in geometry. In the context of shapes and geometry, corresponding refers to the relationship between two or more shapes or objects that have the same position or orientation. For example, corresponding angles, corresponding sides, or corresponding vertices. 

Students with this misconception may struggle to identify which parts of two shapes are corresponding, leading to difficulties in understanding concepts such as congruent and similar shapes, symmetry, and transformations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying corresponding angles in two shapes, students may incorrectly pair angles that are not in the same relative position.
- When working with congruent shapes, students may struggle to match corresponding sides or vertices.
- When describing the symmetry of a shape, students may fail to identify corresponding points or lines on either side of the axis of symmetry.
- When performing transformations such as translations or rotations, students may not understand how the corresponding parts of the shape change.
- When comparing similar shapes, students may have difficulty identifying the corresponding sides or angles that are in proportion."
934,Thinks the subtraction sign means divide,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of subtraction and its corresponding symbol (-). They mistakenly believe that the subtraction sign indicates division, rather than the actual operation of finding the difference between two numbers. This confusion can lead to incorrect calculations and a fundamental misunderstanding of basic arithmetic operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving simple subtraction problems, such as 8 - 2, students may incorrectly divide 8 by 2 instead of subtracting 2 from 8.
- In word problems, like ""Tom has 15 pencils and gives 3 to his friend,"" students may divide 15 by 3 instead of subtracting 3 from 15 to find the number of pencils Tom has left.
- When faced with a mathematical expression like 24 - 4, students may incorrectly divide 24 by 4 instead of subtracting 4 from 24."
935,Fails to use the properties of simple shapes to work out missing lengths,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to apply the basic properties of simple shapes, such as rectangles, triangles, and squares, to find missing lengths. They may struggle to recognize and utilize relationships between different parts of a shape, such as opposite sides being equal in length or the sum of interior angles in a triangle being 180 degrees.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- When given a rectangle with a missing side length, a student may not recognize that opposite sides are equal and instead try to guess the length or use an unrelated method.
- When presented with a right-angled triangle, a student may not use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, even when given the lengths of the other two sides.
- When shown a square with a missing diagonal length, a student may not recognize that the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When faced with a shape that can be divided into simpler shapes, a student may not break it down and use the properties of the individual shapes to find the missing length.
- When given a shape with symmetrical features, a student may not use this symmetry to find missing lengths, such as recognizing that the two halves of a symmetrical shape are mirror images of each other."
936,Thinks the first term in a sequence is the term before the sequence begins (0th term),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the first term in a sequence. They incorrectly assume that the first term refers to a term before the sequence starts, often labeling it as the ""0th term"". In their understanding, the sequence begins with a term that comes before the actual first term. This leads to incorrect identification and labeling of terms in the sequence.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When finding the nth term of an arithmetic or geometric sequence, students may incorrectly start counting from a non-existent 0th term.
2. When identifying the first term of a sequence, students may label it as the second term, assuming there is a term before it.
3. In word problems, students may misinterpret the starting point of a sequence, assuming it begins before the actual first event or value.
4. When graphing sequences, students may incorrectly plot the first term, shifting the entire graph one unit to the right.
5. When solving problems involving sequence notation, students may confuse the first term with a non-existent 0th term, leading to incorrect calculations."
937,"When adding or subtracting surds, simplifies the surds correctly but puts the digits in the answer the wrong way round","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of simplifying surds but struggle with the correct ordering of the terms in the answer. They might correctly simplify each surd, but then incorrectly combine the terms, resulting in a final answer with the digits in the wrong order. This could be due to a lack of attention to the original expression or a misunderstanding of how to combine like terms.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Adding or subtracting surds with different coefficients, e.g., 3√2 + 2√2, where the student may simplify correctly but then swap the coefficients.
- Combining surds with the same radicand but different signs, e.g., 5√3 - 2√3, where the student may get the signs or the order of the terms mixed up.
- Simplifying and adding or subtracting surds with fractions, e.g., 1/2√6 + 3/4√6, where the student may incorrectly combine the fractions or swap the numerators and denominators."
938,"Thinks 1 square metre = 100,000 cubic centimetres","Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the conversion between units of area and volume. They may understand that 1 square metre is equal to 10,000 square centimetres (since 1 metre = 100 centimetres), but then incorrectly apply the conversion factor for volume, which is 1 cubic metre = 1,000,000 cubic centimetres (or 1,000 litres). As a result, they mistakenly think that 1 square metre is equal to 100,000 cubic centimetres, rather than understanding that these units measure different physical quantities.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Calculating the volume of water required to cover an area of 1 square metre to a certain depth.
- Converting between units of area and volume in real-world problems, such as measuring the volume of a room or the amount of material needed to cover a surface.
- Solving problems that involve both area and volume, such as finding the volume of a prism or a cylinder."
939,Describes position to term rule using term to term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly describe the position-to-term rule in a sequence using the term-to-term rule. In other words, students incorrectly explain how to find a specific term in a sequence by describing how each term changes from the previous one, rather than identifying the relationship between the term number (position) and the term itself.

For example, in the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, a student might say: ""You add 3 each time to get the next term"" (term-to-term rule). However, when asked to describe the position-to-term rule, they might incorrectly say: ""You add 3 to the previous term to get the next term, so for the 5th term, you start with 2 and add 3 four times"" instead of identifying the relationship between the term number and the term itself.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When students are asked to describe the rule for finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, but they provide an explanation of how each term changes from the previous one.
* When students are given a sequence and asked to find a specific term, but they use the term-to-term rule to find the term instead of identifying the position-to-term rule.
* When students are asked to write a formula for the nth term of a sequence, but they write a formula that represents the term-to-term rule instead of the position-to-term rule."
940,When writing a function as a function machine confuses the input and the output.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to represent a function as a ""function machine"" - a simple diagram showing an input, a process, and an output. In this context, some students get confused about what constitutes the input and the output of the function. They may incorrectly label the input as the output, and vice versa, or they may confuse the roles of the input and output in the function machine. This can lead to incorrect representations of the function and difficulties in understanding how the function works.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When students are asked to draw a function machine for a simple function, such as ""double the input"" or ""add 2 to the input"", they may incorrectly label the input as the output, or vice versa.
* When students are given a word problem involving a function, such as ""Tom has 5 more pencils than his friend"", they may confuse the input (the number of pencils Tom's friend has) with the output (the number of pencils Tom has).
* When students are working with more complex functions, such as those involving multiple steps or operations, they may become confused about which part of the process is the input and which is the output."
941,Does not recognise that subtracting a larger number from a smaller number will give a negative answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students do not fully understand the concept of subtraction and its relationship with negative numbers. They may believe that subtracting a larger number from a smaller number is not possible or will result in a positive number, rather than understanding that it will yield a negative result. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of exposure to negative numbers or insufficient practice with subtraction problems involving larger and smaller numbers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When subtracting a larger number from a smaller number in a basic subtraction problem, such as 3 - 5.
- Case 2: When solving word problems that involve subtracting a larger quantity from a smaller quantity, such as ""Tom has 5 pencils and gives 8 pencils to his friend. How many pencils does Tom have left?""
- Case 3: When working with number lines or hundreds charts and moving to the left (subtracting) by a larger amount than the starting number.
- Case 4: When solving algebraic equations involving subtraction with negative numbers, such as x - 5 = -2.
- Case 5: When interpreting data in statistics that involves negative numbers, such as a temperature change of -5 degrees Celsius."
942,Thinks you need to include the total as well as the individual parts when asked to write a ratio,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to write a ratio, and they mistakenly believe that the total number of items or parts should be included along with the individual parts. This can occur when students are not clear about the definition of a ratio, which is a comparison of two or more quantities. They may think that including the total will provide a more complete picture, not realizing that a ratio only compares the individual parts.

For example, consider the following scenarios where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A basket contains 12 red apples and 8 green apples. When asked to write a ratio of red apples to green apples, the student may write 12:8:20, including the total number of apples (20) along with the individual parts (12 and 8).
- Case 2: A recipe requires 2 cups of flour and 1 cup of sugar. When asked to write a ratio of flour to sugar, the student may write 2:1:3, including the total number of cups (3) along with the individual parts (2 and 1).
- Case 3: A group of students consists of 15 boys and 10 girls. When asked to write a ratio of boys to girls, the student may write 15:10:25, including the total number of students (25) along with the individual parts (15 and 10)."
943,Divides by (n-2) rather than n when finding an interior angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the interior angle of a polygon. They mistakenly believe that to find the interior angle, they should divide the total sum of interior angles by the number of sides minus 2 (n-2) instead of the total number of sides (n). This error likely stems from a misunderstanding of the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon, which is (n-2) * 180 degrees. However, when finding the measure of each interior angle in a regular polygon, the correct calculation involves dividing the total sum of interior angles by the total number of sides (n).

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the interior angle of a regular hexagon, where students might divide the sum of interior angles (720 degrees) by 4 (6-2) instead of 6.
- Calculating the interior angle of a regular octagon, where students might divide the sum of interior angles (1080 degrees) by 6 (8-2) instead of 8.
- Determining the interior angle of a regular triangle, where students might divide the sum of interior angles (180 degrees) by 1 (3-2) instead of 3."
944,"When dividing involving a power of 10, gives an answer 10 times bigger than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers by powers of 10. They may incorrectly assume that dividing by a power of 10 will result in an answer that is 10 times bigger than the actual answer. For example, when dividing 100 by 10, some students might think the answer is 1000 instead of 10. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of place value and how powers of 10 work in division.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Dividing 500 by 10 and thinking the answer is 5000 instead of 50.
- Dividing 2000 by 100 and thinking the answer is 20000 instead of 20.
- Dividing 400 by 100 and thinking the answer is 4000 instead of 4.
- Dividing 800 by 10 and thinking the answer is 8000 instead of 80."
945,Does not think a number can be a multiple of itself,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of the concept of multiples. They may believe that a multiple of a number must be a product of that number and another number greater than 1. For example, they may think that the multiples of 5 are 10, 15, 20, etc., but not 5 itself. This misunderstanding can lead them to exclude the number itself as a multiple, despite it being a valid multiple.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When listing multiples of a number, students may start from the second multiple (e.g., listing multiples of 3 as 6, 9, 12, etc., instead of 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.).
- When asked if a number is a multiple of itself, students may respond with a ""no"" (e.g., saying 4 is not a multiple of 4).
- When solving problems involving factors and multiples, students may fail to consider the number itself as a possible multiple (e.g., finding the least common multiple of 6 and 8, but not considering 6 and 8 as multiples of themselves)."
946,Believes a proportion of a whole is whole/part not part/whole,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret proportions or fractions as the whole quantity divided by the part, rather than the part divided by the whole. In other words, they might believe that a proportion is calculated by dividing the total amount by the portion being considered, rather than the other way around. This can lead to incorrect calculations and misunderstandings of proportional relationships.

For instance, if a pizza is divided into 8 slices and 2 slices have been eaten, students with this misconception might think the proportion of the eaten pizza is 8/2, rather than 2/8. Similarly, if a toy box contains 12 toys and 4 of them are red, they might think the proportion of red toys is 12/4, rather than 4/12.

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- Calculating the proportion of students in a class who have completed their homework.
- Determining the proportion of ingredients in a recipe.
- Finding the proportion of a shape that is shaded or colored.
- Calculating the proportion of a task that has been completed.
- Determining the proportion of people who voted for a particular candidate in an election."
947,Makes the number negative when asked to find the reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the reciprocal of a number, but instead of flipping the number (i.e., changing its position as numerator and denominator), they mistakenly make the number negative. For example, when asked to find the reciprocal of 5, students with this misconception would write -5 instead of the correct answer, 1/5.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with fractions and students are asked to find the reciprocal of a whole number, such as finding the reciprocal of 3.
- In algebra, when solving equations involving fractions and needing to find the reciprocal to isolate a variable.
- In geometry, when working with proportions and needing to find the reciprocal of a scale factor.
- When performing operations with fractions, such as dividing fractions, and needing to find the reciprocal of one of the fractions.
- In graphing functions, when dealing with the reciprocal function and mistakenly making the number negative instead of flipping it."
948,Believes squaring is the same as adding two,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number (e.g., 3²) means adding the number to itself (e.g., 3 + 3). They fail to understand that the exponentiation operation of squaring represents the multiplication of the number by itself (e.g., 3² = 3 * 3). As a result, they may incorrectly calculate squared values.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating area of a square or rectangle: A student may think that the area of a square with a side length of 4 is 4 + 4 = 8, instead of 4² = 4 * 4 = 16.
- When working with algebraic expressions: A student may simplify an expression like x² to x + x, instead of understanding it as x multiplied by x.
- When solving problems involving exponential growth or decay: A student may misinterpret the effect of squaring a value, leading to incorrect predictions or calculations."
949,Confuses midpoint and gradient between two points,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between two fundamental concepts in coordinate geometry: finding the midpoint of a line segment and calculating the gradient (slope) of a line passing through two points. The midpoint is the point that divides a line segment into two equal parts, whereas the gradient measures the steepness of a line.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly apply the midpoint formula (which involves averaging the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the two points) when asked to find the gradient, or vice versa, apply the gradient formula (which involves finding the ratio of the difference in y-coordinates to the difference in x-coordinates) when asked to find the midpoint.

This misconception can lead to errors in various mathematical contexts, such as graphing, equation solving, and problem-solving.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When asked to find the midpoint of a line segment with endpoints (2,3) and (4,5), a student may incorrectly apply the gradient formula and arrive at an incorrect answer.

2. When given two points (1,2) and (3,4) and asked to find the gradient of the line passing through them, a student may mistakenly use the midpoint formula and obtain an incorrect result.

3. In a word problem, students may be given the coordinates of two points on a map and asked to find the midpoint or the gradient of the line connecting them. If they confuse the two concepts, they will arrive at an incorrect solution.

4. When graphing a line, students may be asked to find the midpoint of a line segment or the gradient of a line. If they confuse the two concepts, their graph may be incorrect, leading to further errors in their work."
950,Thinks there are 5 days in a week,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a distorted understanding of the basic unit of time, specifically the number of days in a week. They may have miscounted or misremembered the days, resulting in the incorrect assumption that there are only 5 days in a week. This could be due to a lack of exposure to calendars, incorrect information, or difficulties with counting and basic number sense.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to count the days of the week and stop at 5, thinking that is the total number.
- When students are scheduling events or appointments and plan for a 5-day week, leading to confusion and errors.
- When students are solving math problems involving time and incorrectly calculate durations or deadlines based on a 5-day week.
- When students are reading calendars or schedules and misinterpret the layout, leading them to believe there are only 5 days in a week.
- When students are comparing their daily routines or activities with others, assuming everyone has the same 5-day week."
951,Only recognises the positive form of a quadratic graph,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are only familiar with the standard form of a quadratic graph that opens upwards (e.g. y = x^2) and are not aware that quadratic graphs can also open downwards (e.g. y = -x^2). As a result, they may struggle to identify and work with quadratic graphs that have a negative coefficient of x^2.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When graphing a quadratic function, students may always assume that the graph will have a minimum point and open upwards, even if the coefficient of x^2 is negative.
* When solving quadratic equations, students may not consider the possibility of a negative discriminant, which would indicate that the graph has no real roots.
* When given a quadratic graph that opens downwards, students may incorrectly identify it as not being a quadratic graph or may struggle to find its equation.

Some short cases where this misconception will occur:

* Case 1: Graphing the equation y = -x^2 + 3x - 2. Students may incorrectly assume that the graph will open upwards.
* Case 2: Solving the equation x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0. Students may not consider the possibility that the graph has no real roots if the coefficient of x^2 is negative.
* Case 3: Identifying the type of graph represented by the equation y = -2x^2 - 3x + 1. Students may incorrectly identify it as not being a quadratic graph due to its negative coefficient of x^2."
952,Adds the index to the number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of indices (exponents) and incorrectly add the index to the base number instead of raising the base number to the power of the index. For example, when calculating 2^3, students with this misconception may think the answer is 2 + 3 = 5, instead of correctly calculating 2 to the power of 3, which is 8.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions with indices, such as 3^2 or 4^5.
- When solving equations involving indices, such as 2^x = 8.
- When working with geometric sequences or series, where indices are used to describe the relationships between terms.
- When applying the rules of indices, such as the product rule or the power rule.
- When solving problems involving exponential growth or decay, where indices are used to model real-world situations."
953,Believes you cannot find the modal category from a pie chart unless given the total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that in order to determine the modal category (the category with the highest frequency) from a pie chart, they need to know the total frequency or the actual numerical values of each category. They may believe that without this information, it's impossible to compare the sizes of the different sectors in the pie chart and identify the modal category.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a pie chart with only percentages and no actual frequencies, and they are asked to identify the modal category.
- When students are presented with a pie chart that has sectors of very similar sizes, making it difficult to visually determine which one is the largest without knowing the exact frequencies.
- When students are asked to compare the modal categories of two or more different pie charts, and they think that without knowing the total frequencies, they cannot make a comparison.
- When students are given a pie chart with a large number of categories, and they feel that without knowing the total frequency, it's too complex to identify the modal category."
954,"Confuses adding 3 with cubing, in algebra","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly interpret the notation of a number or variable with a small '3' written next to or above it. They might think that it means adding 3 to the number or variable instead of understanding it as cubing the number or variable, which means multiplying the number or variable by itself three times.

For example:

- A student might think that 2³ means 2 + 3, instead of 2 × 2 × 2.
- When solving an algebraic expression like x³, a student might interpret it as x + 3, rather than x × x × x.
- In an equation like y = 2x³, a student might mistakenly calculate y as 2x + 3, rather than 2 × (x × x × x).
- When simplifying an expression like (2 + 1)³, a student might incorrectly expand it as (2 + 1) + 3, instead of correctly cubing the entire expression."
955,"When multiplying, treats digits in other columns as if they are units","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying multi-digit numbers. They tend to treat each digit in the multiplicand as if it is in the units place, rather than considering its actual place value. This means that when multiplying, they will multiply each digit in the multiplicand by the multiplier, without taking into account the place value of each digit.

For example, when multiplying 43 by 5, a student with this misconception may multiply 4 (tens place) and 3 (units place) separately by 5, but treat both results as if they are in the units place. They may calculate 4 x 5 = 20 and 3 x 5 = 15, but then add the results as if they are both units, resulting in an incorrect answer.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* Multiplying multi-digit numbers, e.g. 43 x 5 or 24 x 9
* Multiplying numbers with zeros, e.g. 400 x 3 or 205 x 2
* Solving word problems that involve multiplication of multi-digit numbers, e.g. ""If a bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 43 books, how many books can the bookshelf hold in total?"""
956,Thinks that fractions involving a fraction as the denominator can just be read as mixed numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to complex fractions, where a fraction appears as the denominator. They may mistakenly believe that these fractions can be directly read as mixed numbers, without understanding the need to simplify or divide the fractions first. For example, they might think that 1/1/2 can be read as ""one and a half"" (a mixed number), rather than recognizing it as a more complex fraction requiring simplification.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying complex fractions, such as 3/1/4 or 2/3/4.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with a fraction as the denominator, such as 1/1/2 + 1/1/3.
- When comparing the size of fractions with a fraction as the denominator, such as comparing 1/1/2 and 1/1/3.
- When solving real-world problems that involve fractions with a fraction as the denominator, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe."
957,Believes the mean must be an integer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students assume that the mean of a set of numbers must always be a whole number. They may believe this because they are used to working with whole numbers in everyday life, or because they have only encountered examples of means that are whole numbers in their previous studies. As a result, when faced with a set of numbers that do not add up to a multiple of the total count, they may struggle to understand how the mean can be a decimal value.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* Case 1: A student is asked to find the mean of the numbers 3, 4, 5, and 6. They calculate the sum as 18, but then divide by 4 to get 4.5, which they may not accept as a valid answer because it is not an integer.
* Case 2: A student is given a set of exam scores with a total of 245 points out of 5 students. When asked to find the mean score, they may calculate it as 245 ÷ 5 = 49.0, but then round it to 49, assuming that the mean must be a whole number.
* Case 3: A student is working with a dataset of temperatures recorded over a week, with values such as 22.5°C, 24.2°C, and 25.8°C. When asked to find the mean temperature, they may struggle to understand how the mean can be a decimal value, such as 24.5°C."
958,Misunderstands how to calculate the upper bound in subtraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly calculate the upper bound of a subtraction problem involving numbers with a given degree of accuracy, such as those rounded to the nearest 10, 100, or 1000. They may misunderstand the rules for determining the upper bound when subtracting two rounded numbers. For instance, students might think that to find the upper bound of a subtraction, they simply subtract the lower bound of the second number from the upper bound of the first number, which can lead to an incorrect result.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When subtracting two rounded numbers, such as 500 (rounded to the nearest 100) minus 200 (rounded to the nearest 100), a student might incorrectly calculate the upper bound of the result.
- In problems involving the subtraction of measurements with a given degree of accuracy, like 4.5 m (rounded to the nearest 0.1 m) minus 2.3 m (rounded to the nearest 0.1 m), students may struggle to find the correct upper bound of the result.
- When solving word problems that involve subtracting rounded quantities, such as ""A bakery sold 1500 loaves of bread (rounded to the nearest 100) and gave away 200 loaves (rounded to the nearest 100) for free. What is the maximum number of loaves sold?"", students may apply the misconception to calculate the upper bound."
959,Believes it is impossible to subtract a bigger number from a smaller number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to subtraction and are initially taught that it is used to find the difference between two numbers, often with the larger number being the minuend (the number being subtracted from) and the smaller number being the subtrahend (the number being subtracted). They may incorrectly generalize that the minuend must always be larger than the subtrahend, and therefore believe that it's impossible to subtract a bigger number from a smaller number. They might think that this operation is invalid or doesn't make sense.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When dealing with negative numbers. Students might struggle with expressions like 3 - 5, where the subtrahend (5) is greater than the minuend (3).
- Case 2: When solving word problems involving debts or losses. For example, if someone has £5 and owes £8, students might find it hard to understand that they can subtract 8 from 5, resulting in a negative number (-3), which represents a debt.
- Case 3: When performing arithmetic operations with integers. Students might have trouble evaluating expressions like 2 - 7 or -4 - 9, where the subtrahend is greater than the minuend."
960,Divides by the index,"Explanation: The misconception ""Divides by the index"" refers to a common error students make when dealing with exponents or indices, particularly when simplifying expressions or solving equations. This misconception arises when students incorrectly assume that the index (or exponent) is a number by which they should divide, rather than understanding its true function as an indicator of repeated multiplication.

For example, when simplifying expressions like 2^3, students may incorrectly divide 2 by 3, resulting in 0.67, instead of correctly calculating the result as 2 multiplied by itself 3 times (2 × 2 × 2 = 8).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: 3^2 (students may answer 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5 instead of 9)
2. Solving equations: 2^x = 16 (students may try to divide 2 by x instead of finding the correct value of x)
3. Evaluating powers: 4^5 (students may incorrectly calculate 4 ÷ 5 instead of 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4)
4. Comparing quantities: 2^3 vs. 3^2 (students may incorrectly compare the results by dividing the bases by the indices instead of correctly calculating the values)"
961,Does not spot the difference between a gradual change of gradient and 2 distinct line segments with different constant gradients,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to distinguish between a graph that shows a gradual change in gradient, often seen in curves or non-linear relationships, and a graph that consists of two distinct line segments with different constant gradients, often indicating a piecewise linear relationship.

In the case of a gradual change of gradient, the rate of change of the function is not constant, resulting in a smooth curve. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly interpret this as two separate line segments with different gradients, rather than recognizing the continuous change in gradient.

On the other hand, when dealing with two distinct line segments with different constant gradients, students may mistakenly believe that the graph is showing a gradual change in gradient, rather than recognizing the abrupt change in slope between the two segments.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When analyzing the graph of a quadratic function, students may mistakenly believe that the curve consists of two separate line segments with different gradients rather than recognizing the continuous change in gradient.
* When working with piecewise linear functions, students may incorrectly interpret the graph as showing a gradual change in gradient rather than recognizing the distinct line segments with different constant gradients.
* When dealing with real-world data, such as the relationship between temperature and time, students may struggle to distinguish between a gradual change in gradient and distinct line segments with different constant gradients, leading to incorrect interpretations of the data.
* When solving problems involving motion and velocity, students may mistakenly believe that an object's velocity is changing gradually when in fact it is moving with two distinct constant velocities."
962,Thinks 1 cubic metre = 1000 cubic centimetres,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to accurately convert between units of measurement, particularly between cubic metres (m³) and cubic centimetres (cm³) or they do not understand the relationship between the metric units of volume, leading them to make incorrect conversions. They may be confusing it with 1 litre = 1000 cubic centimetres or not fully grasping the concept of volume and unit conversion factors.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the volumes of different objects, one measured in cubic metres and the other in cubic centimetres.
- When solving problems involving the conversion of volume units, such as calculating the volume of a tank or container in cubic centimetres from a given volume in cubic metres.
- When reading measurement scales or labels that display different units, such as measuring the volume of liquids or solids in cubic centimetres and then recording it in cubic metres.
- When applying mathematical formulas that require volume conversions, such as calculating the density of an object using mass and volume.
- When interpreting real-world applications, such as understanding the capacity of a swimming pool or water tank in cubic metres and converting it to cubic centimetres for comparison purposes."
963,Thinks there are 50 minutes in 1 hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of the basic unit of time. They may have been told or assumed that an hour is almost the same length as a standard class period, which is often around 50 minutes, rather than the actual 60 minutes. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of exposure to the correct definition of an hour or a misinterpretation of the way time is divided and used in everyday life.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- When asked to convert 1 hour to minutes, the student answers 50 minutes.
- When calculating the duration of an event that lasted 2 hours, the student answers 100 minutes.
- When solving a problem involving time, such as ""If I have 1 hour to finish my homework, and I spend 20 minutes on the first question, how many minutes do I have left?"", the student may calculate the remaining time based on 50 minutes instead of 60 minutes."
964,"When dividing involving a power of 10, gives an answer 10 times smaller than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers by powers of 10. They may understand that when multiplying by 10, the digits shift one place to the left (e.g., 10 × 5 = 50), but when dividing by 10, they incorrectly apply the same logic in reverse. Instead of simply shifting the digits one place to the right (e.g., 50 ÷ 10 = 5), they shift it two places to the right or apply other incorrect rules, resulting in an answer that is 10 times smaller than the correct one.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. 400 ÷ 10 = ? (Student answers 0.4 instead of 40)
2. 50 ÷ 10 = ? (Student answers 0.05 instead of 5)
3. 2000 ÷ 100 = ? (Student answers 2 instead of 20)
4. 8 ÷ 0.1 = ? (Student answers 0.08 instead of 80)
5. 450 ÷ 10 = ? (Student answers 0.45 instead of 45)

In these cases, students demonstrate an incorrect understanding of the relationship between division and powers of 10, leading to answers that are consistently 10 times smaller than the correct ones."
965,Adds the numerators when working out a combined probability,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the probability of two or more events occurring together, also known as combined or compound probability. Instead of applying the correct method, such as multiplying the probabilities of the individual events, students mistakenly add the numerators (the numbers on top) of the fractions representing the individual probabilities. This incorrect approach can lead to probabilities greater than 1, which is impossible.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- A spinner has a 1/4 chance of landing on red and a 1/3 chance of landing on blue. What is the probability of spinning red and then blue? (Student incorrectly adds 1 + 1 to get 2, instead of multiplying the probabilities).
- A coin has a 1/2 chance of landing on heads, and a dice has a 1/6 chance of rolling a 6. What is the probability of flipping heads and rolling a 6? (Student incorrectly adds 1 + 1 to get 2, instead of multiplying the probabilities).
- A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If a ball is drawn and then replaced, what is the probability of drawing a red ball and then a blue ball? (Student incorrectly adds the numerators of the individual probabilities instead of multiplying them)."
966,Gives an answer of 0 when there are no solutions to an equation.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to solve an equation and they find that there are no values of the variable that satisfy the equation. Instead of stating that the equation has no solutions, they incorrectly conclude that the solution is 0. This misconception may stem from the fact that students are used to seeing 0 as a valid solution to equations, such as in the case of a linear equation that intersects the x-axis at the origin.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When solving quadratic equations with no real roots, such as x^2 + 1 = 0.
* When solving linear equations with no solutions, such as 2x + 3 = 2x + 4.
* When solving systems of equations that are inconsistent, such as x + y = 2 and x + y = 3."
967,"When solving simultaneous equations graphically, only gives one of two solutions","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the relationship between the graphical representation of simultaneous equations and the solutions they represent. When graphing two linear equations on a coordinate plane, the points of intersection between the lines correspond to the solutions of the simultaneous equations. However, some students may mistakenly assume that there is only one solution to the equations, possibly due to incomplete graphing, not considering all possible intersections, or failing to account for potential coincident lines (where the lines overlap). This misconception may also stem from a lack of understanding that two lines can intersect at more than one point if they are not straight, but in the case of linear equations, they can intersect at most once, however the misconception might arise when dealing with non-linear equations.


Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When graphing two linear equations that intersect at two distinct points, but the student only identifies one intersection.
2. When dealing with non-linear equations, such as quadratic or cubic equations, which can have multiple intersections, but the student assumes there is only one solution.
3. When the lines are coincident (i.e., they overlap), and the student fails to recognize that there are infinitely many solutions.
4. When the lines are parallel, and the student assumes there is one solution, when in fact, there are no solutions."
968,Confuses powers and multiples,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of powers (exponents) and confuse them with multiples. Students may think that a power represents the number of times a number is added to itself, rather than the number of times a number is multiplied by itself. For example, they might believe that 2^3 means 2 + 2 + 2, rather than 2 × 2 × 2.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of exponential relationships.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- Simplifying expressions with exponents (e.g., 2^4, 3^2)
- Solving equations involving exponents (e.g., 2^x = 16)
- Comparing the growth of exponential and linear functions (e.g., y = 2^x vs. y = 2x)
- Real-world applications, such as calculating compound interest or population growth, where exponential relationships are involved."
969,Believes you can subtract from inside brackets without expanding when solving an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving algebraic equations involving brackets. They mistakenly believe that they can directly subtract a value from inside the brackets without following the order of operations (i.e., expanding the brackets first). This can lead to incorrect simplification and ultimately, an incorrect solution to the equation.

For example, in the equation 2(x - 3) = 10, a student with this misconception might incorrectly simplify it by subtracting 3 from x without multiplying 2 by both x and -3. Similarly, in the equation 5(x + 2) - 3 = 12, they might attempt to subtract 3 from inside the brackets, ignoring the multiplication of 5 with both x and 2.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- 3(2x - 1) = 11, where a student might try to subtract 1 from 2x without multiplying 3.
- 2(x + 4) - 2 = 8, where a student might try to subtract 2 from inside the brackets without expanding.
- x(x - 2) + 1 = 6, where a student might incorrectly simplify the equation by subtracting 2 from x without considering the multiplication of x with both x and -2."
970,"In inverse proportion, believes k is the total of the two variables ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of inverse proportionality. In an inverse proportion relationship, two variables are related in such a way that as one variable increases, the other decreases, and vice versa, while their product remains constant. The constant of proportionality, often represented as k, is the product of the two variables, not their sum. Students who hold this misconception may think that k is the total or sum of the two variables, rather than their product.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When solving problems involving inverse proportion, such as ""y is inversely proportional to x, and when x = 2, y = 6, find the value of y when x = 3"", students may incorrectly calculate k as the sum of x and y (e.g., k = 2 + 6 = 8) instead of their product (e.g., k = 2 × 6 = 12).
* When graphing inverse proportion relationships, students may incorrectly label the constant of proportionality, k, as the sum of the x and y values at a particular point on the graph, rather than the product of those values.
* When comparing different inverse proportion relationships, students may incorrectly conclude that the relationship with the larger sum of variables has a larger constant of proportionality, rather than recognizing that the constant of proportionality depends on the product of the variables."
971,Believes that adding a negative will increase the value of the original number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of negative numbers and their operations. They might think that adding a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive value, thus increasing the original number. This is because, in their everyday experiences, the term ""add"" is often associated with an increase or a gain. As a result, they may struggle to comprehend that adding a negative number actually represents a decrease or a loss.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving simple arithmetic problems, such as 5 + (-3), students may answer 8, thinking that the addition of a negative number increases the value.
- In word problems, like ""Tom has 10 pencils and gives 2 away,"" students might represent the situation as 10 + (-2) and incorrectly conclude that Tom now has 12 pencils.
- When working with number lines, students may move in the wrong direction when adding a negative number, resulting in an incorrect answer."
972,Does not realise that if the horizontal and vertical measurements of a diagonal line segment switch it remains the same size,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the properties of diagonal line segments and the relationship between their horizontal and vertical measurements. They may believe that if the horizontal and vertical measurements of a diagonal line segment are swapped, the length of the diagonal line segment will change. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the Pythagorean theorem and the concept of equivalent ratios.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the length of a diagonal line segment in a rectangle and switching the length and width.
- When comparing the lengths of diagonal line segments in different rectangles with the same dimensions but with length and width swapped.
- When solving problems involving right-angled triangles and the Pythagorean theorem, and the measurements of the horizontal and vertical sides are interchanged.
- When working with similar triangles and the concept of proportional sides.
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as building design, and the measurements of diagonal lines need to be calculated."
973,Finds area of whole circle rather than area of sector,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a sector of a circle, but they mistakenly calculate the area of the entire circle instead. The students understand the formula for the area of a circle (A = πr^2), but they fail to apply the concept of a sector, which is a fraction of the circle. As a result, they do not multiply the area of the circle by the fraction of the circle that the sector represents (usually given as a central angle in degrees).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is asked to find the area of a sector of a circle with a central angle of 60 degrees and a radius of 4 cm. Instead of finding the area of the sector, they calculate the area of the entire circle (16π cm^2) and do not multiply it by the fraction of the circle that the sector represents (60/360 or 1/6).
* A student is given a real-world problem, such as finding the area of a slice of pizza that is 1/8 of a circular pizza with a diameter of 14 inches. Instead of finding the area of the slice, they calculate the area of the entire pizza (π(7)^2 = 49π in^2) and do not divide it by 8 to find the area of the slice.
* A student is asked to find the area of a sector of a circle with a central angle of 90 degrees and a radius of 3 m. Instead of finding the area of the sector, they calculate the area of the entire circle (9π m^2) and do not multiply it by the fraction of the circle that the sector represents (90/360 or 1/4)."
974,Believes multiplying a positive by a negative gives a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of negative numbers and the multiplication rules that apply to them. They may think that multiplying two numbers always results in a positive answer, regardless of the signs of the numbers being multiplied. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the abstract concept of negative numbers and the rules of multiplication, or because they have not been exposed to enough examples to solidify their understanding.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying a positive integer by a negative integer, e.g., 3 × -4.
- When multiplying a negative fraction by a positive integer, e.g., -1/2 × 3.
- When solving algebraic expressions, such as -2x × 3, where x is a positive value.
- When working with word problems that involve opposite directions or opposite effects, such as a temperature decrease or a financial loss.
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as calculating the change in temperature or the result of a financial transaction involving a loss."
975,"When solving an equation, multiplies instead of dividing ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with an equation that involves a variable multiplied by a coefficient, and they need to isolate the variable. Instead of dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient to solve for the variable, they mistakenly multiply both sides by the coefficient, which can lead to an incorrect solution.

For example, in the equation 2x = 6, students with this misconception might multiply both sides by 2, resulting in 4x = 12, instead of dividing both sides by 2, which would give x = 3.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When solving linear equations with coefficients, e.g., 3x = 9
- When working with algebraic expressions involving multiplication and division, e.g., 4x/2 = 8
- When solving problems involving proportions or ratios, e.g., 2x/5 = 3/2
- When solving word problems that require the application of mathematical operations to solve for an unknown quantity, e.g., ""If Sally has 3 times as many pencils as John, and John has 6 pencils, how many pencils does Sally have?"""
976,"Thinks a Fibonacci sequence must start with 1, 1","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the Fibonacci sequence with the typical example starting with 1, 1, and they mistakenly assume that all Fibonacci sequences must begin with these numbers. They may not understand that a Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recursive relationship where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, and that it can start with any two numbers. As a result, they may struggle to identify or generate Fibonacci sequences that start with different numbers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to generate a Fibonacci sequence and they always start with 1, 1, without considering the possibility of starting with other numbers.
- When students are given a sequence that follows the Fibonacci pattern but starts with different numbers, and they fail to recognize it as a Fibonacci sequence.
- When students are asked to apply Fibonacci sequences to real-world problems, such as modeling population growth or financial markets, and they incorrectly assume that the sequence must start with 1, 1, limiting their ability to adapt the sequence to the specific problem."
977,Confuses the sign for parallel lines as being dashes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the symbol for parallel lines is a series of dashes or hyphens (- - -), rather than the correct symbol which is two vertical lines (||). This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect notation and potentially cause confusion in understanding geometric concepts involving parallel lines.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to the concept of parallel lines and are unsure of the correct notation.
- When reading or writing geometric expressions involving parallel lines, such as ""line A is parallel to line B"", and incorrectly using dashes instead of the correct symbol.
- When interpreting diagrams or graphs that involve parallel lines and misinterpreting the notation used.
- When solving problems that require students to identify or draw parallel lines, and using the incorrect notation to indicate parallelism."
978,"When completing the square, believes the constant in the bracket is the coefficient of x","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They mistakenly think that when rewriting the quadratic expression in the form (x + a)^2, the constant term 'a' inside the bracket is the same as the coefficient of x in the original quadratic expression. This misunderstanding shows a lack of comprehension of the actual process of completing the square, which involves creating a perfect square trinomial by adding and subtracting a specific constant term.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When the coefficient of x is a whole number, students might assume it directly translates to the constant inside the bracket. For example, in the expression x^2 + 4x, they might think the completed square form is (x + 4)^2.
- When working with more complex quadratic expressions, such as x^2 + 5x + 2, students may incorrectly identify the constant inside the bracket as 5, instead of following the proper procedure for completing the square.
- In problems where the coefficient of x^2 is not 1, such as 2x^2 + 3x, students with this misconception may struggle to properly complete the square due to their incorrect assumption about the constant inside the bracket."
979,Thinks can combine the numerator and denominator after simplifying an algebraic fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students incorrectly assume that after simplifying an algebraic fraction, they can combine the numerator and denominator as if they were simple numbers. They fail to recognize that the numerator and denominator are separate algebraic expressions, often containing variables, and cannot be added or combined in the same way as numerical fractions.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying a fraction like (x + 2)/(x + 2), students might think they can combine the x's and the 2's to get a simplified answer of (2x + 4).
- When simplifying a fraction like (x + 1)/(x - 1), students might think they can combine the x's and the constants to get a simplified answer of 2x.
- When simplifying a fraction like (2x + 2)/(x + 1), students might think they can combine the 2x and the 2 to get a simplified answer of (2x + 3)/(x + 1) or even just 4."
980,Hasn't lined up the place value columns when writing out the calculation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are performing arithmetic operations involving multi-digit numbers, such as addition or subtraction. They may fail to properly align the digits in the correct place value columns, leading to incorrect calculations. This can happen when students are writing out the calculation horizontally or vertically, and they don't take care to line up the hundreds, tens, and ones places correctly.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When adding or subtracting multi-digit numbers, such as 456 + 279 or 945 - 378.
- When performing calculations involving money or measurements, such as £45.60 + £27.90 or 456g - 278g.
- When solving word problems that involve multi-digit numbers, such as ""Tom has 456 pencils and he gives 279 to his friend, how many pencils does Tom have left?""
- When performing calculations involving decimal numbers, such as 45.6 + 27.9 or 94.5 - 37.8."
981,Believes inequalities cannot be combined,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that inequalities cannot be combined or operated on in the same way as equations. They may think that inequalities are standalone statements and cannot be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided like equations. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the properties of inequalities, such as the ability to add or subtract the same value from both sides of an inequality, or to multiply or divide both sides by a positive value.

This misconception can lead students to believe that they cannot solve systems of inequalities or combine multiple inequalities to form new ones. They may also struggle with solving inequalities that involve multiple variables or complex expressions.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

* When solving a system of linear inequalities, such as 2x + 3y > 5 and x - 2y < 3.
* When combining two or more inequalities to form a new inequality, such as x > 2 and x < 5.
* When solving inequalities involving multiple variables, such as 2x + 5y > 3x - 2y.
* When working with compound inequalities, such as 2x + 3 > 5 and x - 2 < 3."
982,Calculates perimeter when asked for area,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly calculate the perimeter of a shape instead of its area. Perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape, while area is the amount of space inside the shape. Students with this misconception may incorrectly apply the formula for perimeter (e.g., adding up the lengths of all sides) when they are asked to find the area of a shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the area of a rectangle, a student might add up the lengths of all sides (e.g., 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 14) instead of multiplying the length and width (e.g., 3 x 4 = 12).
- When asked to find the area of a triangle, a student might add up the lengths of the three sides (e.g., 3 + 4 + 5 = 12) instead of using the formula for the area of a triangle (e.g., 1/2 x base x height).
- When asked to find the area of a complex shape, a student might break it down into smaller shapes and calculate their perimeters, rather than finding the areas of each shape and adding them together."
983,"When the dividend is a mixed number and the divisor is an integer, thinks they only divide the fraction by the integer.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a mixed number by an integer. They incorrectly assume that they only need to divide the fractional part of the mixed number by the integer, ignoring the whole number part. This can lead to incorrect results, as the whole number part should also be considered in the division process.

For example, when dividing 3 1/2 by 2, a student with this misconception might only divide the 1/2 by 2, resulting in 1/4, and then incorrectly state the answer as 3 1/4, instead of converting the mixed number to an improper fraction (7/2) and then dividing by 2.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- 2 3/4 ÷ 3
- 1 1/2 ÷ 4
- 3 2/3 ÷ 2
- 5 1/4 ÷ 5"
984,Writes the numerator of an improper fraction as the number of wholes when converting to a mixed number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the numerator of an improper fraction directly represents the number of whole units when converting it to a mixed number. They fail to understand that the numerator actually represents the total number of equal parts, which may include both whole units and fractional parts. As a result, they incorrectly write the numerator as the whole number part, without properly dividing it by the denominator to find the actual whole number component.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Converting the improper fraction 7/4 to a mixed number, where students may incorrectly write the whole number part as 7, instead of dividing 7 by 4 to get 1 with a remainder of 3.
* Converting the improper fraction 9/2 to a mixed number, where students may incorrectly write the whole number part as 9, instead of dividing 9 by 2 to get 4 with a remainder of 1.
* Converting the improper fraction 11/3 to a mixed number, where students may incorrectly write the whole number part as 11, instead of dividing 11 by 3 to get 3 with a remainder of 2."
985,Believes that repeated percentage change is equivalent to a single change by the sum of the percentages,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that applying multiple percentage changes to a value is the same as adding the percentages together and applying the result as a single change. For instance, if a product's price increases by 10% and then by another 10%, some students might think the overall change is 20% (10% + 10%), rather than calculating the compound effect of the two separate percentage changes.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Calculating the overall percentage change in the price of an item after multiple discounts or markups.
- Determining the total percentage change in an investment or a bank account balance after multiple interest rate changes.
- Analyzing the cumulative effect of annual percentage changes in population growth, inflation rates, or other statistical data.

In each of these cases, the student may simply add the percentages together, overlooking the compounding effect that occurs when multiple percentage changes are applied sequentially."
986,Does not understand that a remainder can be written as a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers and they believe that remainders can only be expressed as whole numbers, not fractions. They may have difficulty understanding that a remainder is essentially the amount left over after a division operation, and that it can be represented as a fraction of the divisor. This limited understanding can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of flexibility when working with division problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a number by another number and the remainder is not a whole number, for example, 7 ÷ 4 = 1 with a remainder of 3, which can also be written as 1 3/4.
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, for instance, 3 1/2 can be written as 7/2, but students may struggle to see the remainder as a fraction.
- When solving real-world problems that involve division, such as measuring ingredients for cooking or dividing materials for a project, and the remainder needs to be expressed as a fraction.
- When simplifying fractions or working with equivalent ratios, and a remainder needs to be rewritten as a fraction to complete the calculation."
987,Believes that the order of a worded calculation should be changed to follow BIDMAS ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction), which is a set of rules governing the order of operations in mathematical expressions. Students may mistakenly believe that the order of operations in worded calculations should be altered to follow the BIDMAS sequence, even if the context of the problem does not require it. 

For example, consider the following worded calculation: ""Tom has 5 groups of 3 pencils each, and then he gives 2 pencils to his friend."" Students with this misconception might change the order of the calculation to follow BIDMAS and calculate as follows: 5 × 3 - 2 = ?, but incorrectly change it to 5 - 2 × 3 = ?.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Worded calculations involving multiple operations, such as ""5 groups of 3 pencils each, and then 2 more groups are added, how many pencils are there in total?""
2. Worded problems that involve a mix of operations, such as ""If Sara has £15 and spends £3 on a toy, then buys 2 packs of sweets for £2 each, how much money does she have left?""
3. Real-world scenarios that require mathematical calculations, such as calculating the total cost of items at a store, where students might incorrectly apply the BIDMAS sequence."
988,"When converting a percentage to a decimal, just writes all the digits after a decimal point.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a percentage to a decimal. They mistakenly believe that to convert a percentage, they can simply write the percentage value after a decimal point, without actually performing the necessary operation of dividing by 100. For example, when converting 25% to a decimal, students might incorrectly write 0.25% as 0.25 is the correct answer but when converting 250%, they might write 0.250 which is incorrect.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Converting 10% to a decimal, where students might write 0.10, which happens to be correct in this case, but it doesn't show understanding.
- Converting 200% to a decimal, where students might write 0.200, which is incorrect.
- Converting 5% to a decimal, where students might write 0.05, which is correct but again doesn't show understanding of the conversion process."
989,Does not understand that area under a speed time graph gives distance because distance = speed x time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the relationship between the area under a speed-time graph and the concept of distance. They may understand the formula ""distance = speed x time"" in isolation, but struggle to visualize and apply it in the context of a graph. Specifically, they may not grasp that the area under the speed-time graph represents the accumulation of distance traveled over time, and that this area is a direct result of the product of speed and time.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the distance traveled by an object given its speed-time graph, and they only focus on the speed or time axis without considering the area under the graph.
- When students are given a scenario where an object's speed changes over time, and they are asked to find the total distance traveled. They may incorrectly calculate the distance by only using the speed and time values at specific points, rather than finding the area under the entire graph.
- When students are comparing the distance traveled by two objects with different speed-time graphs, and they incorrectly conclude that the object with the higher speed or longer time traveled the greater distance, without considering the area under each graph."
990,Does not realise you can use equivalent fractions to break fractions up into smaller divisions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize that equivalent fractions can be used to break down a fraction into smaller, more manageable parts. They may believe that a fraction is a fixed entity that cannot be altered or divided further. As a result, they may struggle with operations involving fractions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, students may not realize that they can find a common denominator by using equivalent fractions.
- When comparing the size of fractions, students may not understand that equivalent fractions can be used to compare fractions with different denominators.
- When solving problems involving fractions of shapes or quantities, students may not recognize that equivalent fractions can be used to break down the shape or quantity into smaller parts.
- When simplifying fractions, students may not realize that equivalent fractions can be used to simplify a fraction to its lowest terms.
- When solving real-world problems involving fractions, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza among friends, students may not understand that equivalent fractions can be used to break down the quantities into smaller, more manageable parts."
991,Believes that when finding area under graph you can use the upper y value rather than average of upper and lower,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area under a graph, particularly when approximating the area using rectangles or trapezoids. They mistakenly believe that they can simply use the upper y-value of the graph as the height of the rectangle or trapezoid, rather than finding the average of the upper and lower y-values. This results in an overestimation or underestimation of the actual area under the graph.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Approximating the area under a velocity-time graph to find the distance traveled by an object.
2. Finding the area under a curve to calculate the definite integral in calculus.
3. Determining the area under a graph representing the rate of change of a quantity to find the total change.
4. Calculating the area of a trapezoid or a complex shape using the formula for area, but using only the upper y-value instead of the average of the upper and lower y-values.
5. Solving problems in physics, engineering, or economics where the area under a graph represents a physical quantity, such as work, energy, or revenue."
992,"Thinks they find the length of a line between 2 points by adding coordinates, rather than subtracting","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the length of a line between two points on a coordinate plane. They incorrectly believe that the length can be calculated by adding the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the two points. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of distance and how it relates to the coordinate plane.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the length of a horizontal or vertical line, students may add the x-coordinates or y-coordinates instead of subtracting them.
- When calculating the distance between two points using the distance formula, students may incorrectly add the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates instead of using the correct formula.
- When working with real-world problems, such as finding the distance between two locations on a map, students may apply the incorrect method of adding coordinates, leading to inaccurate results."
993,Believes the length of the arms influence the size of the angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the length of the arms of an angle determines its size. They may think that an angle with longer arms is larger than an angle with shorter arms, regardless of the actual degree measure of the angle. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of angles and how they are measured.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing two angles with different arm lengths but the same degree measure, students may incorrectly say the angle with longer arms is larger.
- When drawing angles, students may try to make the arms of the angle longer or shorter to change its size, rather than focusing on the actual angle formed by the two arms.
- When solving problems involving angle measurements, students may incorrectly assume that the length of the arms affects the calculation of the angle's size.
- When working with real-world examples, such as measuring angles in a room or in a diagram, students may be confused by the varying lengths of the arms and incorrectly determine the angle's size."
994,"When completing the square in the form (x - a)^2 + b, believes b = a^2 + the original constant","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They understand that completing the square involves rewriting the quadratic in a perfect square form, but they mistakenly believe that the constant term 'b' in the completed square form is simply the sum of 'a' squared (where 'a' is the number being subtracted from 'x') and the original constant term in the quadratic expression.

For example, when completing the square for the expression x^2 - 4x + 5, students with this misconception may think that 'b' is simply (-4/2)^2 + 5, which is 4 + 5 = 9. This would lead them to incorrectly write the completed square form as (x - 2)^2 + 9.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When the original quadratic expression has a negative leading coefficient, e.g., -x^2 + 6x - 3.
- When the original quadratic expression has a non-integer constant term, e.g., x^2 - 3x + 2.5.
- When the original quadratic expression has a non-integer coefficient of x, e.g., x^2 - 2.5x + 1.

In each of these cases, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the value of 'b' in the completed square form."
995,Believes the lowest common multiple is found my multiplying the numbers together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the lowest common multiple (LCM) and assume that it can be found by simply multiplying the given numbers together. They may think that the product of the numbers is the smallest number that both numbers can divide into evenly, without realizing that this method often results in a larger number than necessary, rather than the smallest possible multiple.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Finding the LCM of 4 and 6, where students might multiply 4 and 6 to get 24, which is actually the correct LCM, but this is just a coincidence. This can reinforce the misconception.
- Finding the LCM of 12 and 15, where students might multiply 12 and 15 to get 180, when in fact the LCM is 60.
- Finding the LCM of 10 and 20, where students might multiply 10 and 20 to get 200, when in fact the LCM is 20."
996,Does not know that units of volume are usually cubed,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware that units of volume are typically three-dimensional and therefore require cubing to accurately represent the amount of space occupied. Students may mistakenly assume that units of volume are the same as units of length or area, which can lead to incorrect calculations and conversions. This lack of understanding can cause confusion when working with different units of volume, such as cubic meters (m³), cubic centimeters (cm³), or liters (L).

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When converting between different units of volume, such as milliliters (mL) to liters (L), students may not cube the conversion factor.
- When calculating the volume of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a rectangular prism, students may not cube the length of the sides.
- When comparing the volumes of different objects or containers, students may not take into account the cubed units, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- When solving real-world problems involving volume, such as calculating the amount of water in a pool or the volume of a package, students may not use cubed units, resulting in incorrect answers."
997,Subtracts instead of multiplies,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they need to subtract a certain value instead of multiplying it. In multiplication, we are adding a number a certain number of times, but students with this misconception may think that the operation is subtraction, which is a completely different concept. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication, or due to a mistake in interpreting the mathematical operation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 books. If the student is asked to find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, they may subtract 3 from 5 instead of multiplying 5 by 3.

2. A bakery sells 4 rows of cakes, with 6 cakes in each row. A student with this misconception may subtract 6 from 4 instead of multiplying 4 by 6 to find the total number of cakes.

3. A farmer has 3 baskets, each containing 8 apples. To find the total number of apples, a student with this misconception may subtract 8 from 3 instead of multiplying 3 by 8."
998,"When the final stage of solving a problem is ""variable to a power"" = constant, assume the constant is the answer, without finding the root.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving equations involving exponents or powers and reach the final stage where the variable is raised to a power and equals a constant. Instead of taking the root of both sides to isolate the variable, they mistakenly assume that the constant is the solution to the equation. This can happen when students overlook the fact that the variable is raised to a power or misunderstand the concept of inverse operations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: Solving the equation x^2 = 16, a student may assume the answer is 16 instead of taking the square root of both sides to find x = ±4.
* Case 2: When solving the equation 2^x = 8, a student may think the answer is 8, rather than using logarithms or recognizing that 2^3 = 8, so x = 3.
* Case 3: In the equation x^3 = 27, a student may incorrectly assume the answer is 27, instead of taking the cube root of both sides to find x = 3.
* Case 4: Solving the equation (x + 2)^2 = 25, a student may think the answer is 25, rather than taking the square root of both sides and solving for x."
999,Confuses the method of selection with the group selected in statistics,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of sampling methods in statistics, specifically the difference between the method used to select a group (e.g., random sampling, stratified sampling) and the actual group of individuals or items being selected. 

They may think that the method itself is what defines the group, rather than the characteristics of the individuals or items within the group. This confusion can lead to incorrect conclusions about the population being studied.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to describe a sampling method, students might describe the characteristics of the group instead of the method used to select them (e.g., ""We selected a group of tall people"" instead of ""We used random sampling"").
- When interpreting data, students might assume that a particular sampling method guarantees a representative sample, without considering the actual characteristics of the group selected (e.g., ""Since we used stratified sampling, our sample must be representative of the whole population"").
- When designing an experiment, students might focus on the method of selection rather than ensuring that the group selected is representative of the population being studied (e.g., ""We'll just use a random sample, so it doesn't matter who's in the group"")."
1000,Draws false conclusion from a pie chart,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly interpret the data presented in a pie chart, leading to false conclusions. They may misread or misinterpret the proportions, percentages, or labels on the chart, resulting in an inaccurate understanding of the data. This can happen when students lack a thorough understanding of how to read and analyze pie charts, or when they make assumptions about the data without properly considering the chart's context and limitations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student looks at a pie chart showing the favorite colors of a class and concludes that the majority of the class likes the color blue, when in fact, the chart shows that blue is the favorite color of only 30% of the class.
- A student analyzes a pie chart displaying the sales of different products and assumes that the product with the largest slice of the pie is the most profitable, without considering the actual sales figures or profit margins.
- A student examines a pie chart illustrating the distribution of different age groups in a population and incorrectly concludes that the majority of the population is elderly, when the chart actually shows that the majority is made up of young adults.
- A student looks at a pie chart comparing the scores of different teams in a competition and mistakenly believes that the team with the largest slice of the pie is the overall winner, without considering the actual scores or competition rules."
1001,Does not know how to divide a fraction by an integer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unsure of how to divide a fraction by an integer. They may incorrectly assume that dividing a fraction by an integer is the same as dividing the numerator by the integer, or they may think that the integer should be converted to a fraction with a denominator of 1. They may also struggle with understanding the concept of dividing by a whole number, leading to incorrect operations or confusion.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions like (1/2) ÷ 3, students may attempt to divide only the numerator (1) by 3, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- When solving word problems, such as ""A recipe calls for 1/4 cup of sugar to be shared among 6 people"", students may struggle to divide the fraction by the integer.
- When working with mixed numbers, such as 2 1/3 ÷ 2, students may be unsure of how to proceed with the division operation."
1002,Thinks the elevation is the plan view of a shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to visualize and understand the differences between various views of a 3D shape, specifically the elevation and plan view. Elevation refers to the 2D representation of a 3D object from the side, whereas plan view is the 2D representation from directly above. Students with this misconception may think that the elevation of a shape is the same as its plan view, leading to confusion when interpreting or creating diagrams.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to draw the elevation of a 3D shape, students may draw the shape as if looking down on it from above, rather than from the side.
- When interpreting architectural drawings or blueprints, students may misinterpret the elevation of a building as its floor plan.
- When creating their own designs for 3D models, students may label their plan view as the elevation, or vice versa.
- When working with isometric drawings, students may have difficulty distinguishing between the plan view and elevation, leading to incorrect representations of the shape.
- When solving problems involving 3D shapes, students may incorrectly apply formulas or calculations due to their misunderstanding of the elevation and plan view."
1003,"Believes the equation of a vertical line is in the form y = ax, where a is the x intercept","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the equation of a line and its graphical representation. They may have learned that the equation of a line can be represented in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. However, for a vertical line, the concept of slope (m) is not applicable because the line does not have a slope in the traditional sense (i.e., the slope is undefined). 

The misconception occurs when students try to apply the general equation of a line (y = mx + b) to a vertical line and incorrectly assume that the coefficient 'a' represents the x-intercept. This shows a lack of understanding of the unique properties of vertical lines and their equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to find the equation of a vertical line passing through a given point, students may write y = ax, where a is the x-coordinate of the point.
2. When graphing a vertical line, students may incorrectly label the x-intercept as the value of 'a' in the equation y = ax.
3. When solving a system of equations involving a vertical line, students may try to use the equation y = ax to find the intersection point with another line."
1004,Thinks that a number in front of a bracket means divide,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a number in front of a bracket or parentheses indicates division, rather than multiplication. For example, they might interpret the expression 2(3 + 4) as 2 divided by (3 + 4), rather than 2 multiplied by (3 + 4). This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a fundamental misunderstanding of algebraic notation.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

* Evaluating expressions like 3(2x + 1), where the student may think they need to divide 3 by the quantity inside the bracket.
* Simplifying equations like 4(x + 5) = 20, where the student may incorrectly divide 4 by (x + 5) instead of multiplying.
* Solving problems involving algebraic expressions, such as 2(5 - 3) + 1, where the student may misinterpret the operation in front of the bracket."
1005,"Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order, unless brackets are used","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). They incorrectly assume that operations should be carried out in the order in which they appear from left to right, unless brackets are used to indicate otherwise.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations, as students may perform addition or subtraction before multiplication or division, or ignore the priority of indices. 

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. 3 + 4 × 5: A student with this misconception would calculate 3 + 4 first, then multiply 7 by 5, resulting in an incorrect answer of 35, instead of the correct answer of 23.

2. 12 ÷ 3 + 2: A student would divide 12 by 3, then add 2, which is correct in this case, but if the question was 12 + 3 ÷ 2, they would add 12 and 3 first, then divide by 2, resulting in an incorrect answer.

3. 9 - 3 + 2: A student would subtract 3 from 9, then add 2, which is correct, but if the question was 9 + 3 - 2, they would add 9 and 3 first, then subtract 2, which is correct, but they are not following the order of operations correctly.

4. 8 × 2 + 12 ÷ 4: A student would multiply 8 by 2, then add 12, then divide by 4, resulting in an incorrect answer, instead of following the correct order of operations."
1006,Believes the mean is something divided by the number of categories given,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to calculate the mean, they should divide a quantity by the number of categories or groups in a dataset, rather than dividing the total sum of values by the total number of data points. This indicates a misunderstanding of the concept of mean as an average value, where students are incorrectly applying the idea of division to categories rather than individual data points.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is given a dataset with multiple categories and is asked to find the mean, they might divide the sum of all values by the number of categories instead of the total number of data points.
- In a bar chart with different categories, a student might attempt to find the mean by dividing the total value by the number of bars, rather than the total number of observations.
- When a student is asked to calculate the average score of students in different classes, they might mistakenly divide the total score by the number of classes instead of the total number of students."
1007,Does not connect rotational symmetry to number of sides/vertices,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize the relationship between the number of sides or vertices of a shape and its rotational symmetry. They may not understand that a shape's rotational symmetry is related to the number of times it looks the same when rotated around its center. For example, a square has 4-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same when rotated 90 degrees (or a quarter turn) around its center, and this is connected to the fact that it has 4 sides. Similarly, an equilateral triangle has 3-fold rotational symmetry because it looks the same when rotated 120 degrees (or a third of a turn) around its center, and this is connected to the fact that it has 3 sides.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify the rotational symmetry of a regular polygon, such as a square, triangle, or hexagon, and they fail to consider the number of sides or vertices.
- When students are given a shape with an irregular number of sides, such as a pentagon or a heptagon, and they struggle to determine its rotational symmetry because they don't understand the connection to the number of sides.
- When students are asked to create a shape with a specific rotational symmetry, such as 5-fold or 6-fold, and they fail to consider the number of sides or vertices needed to achieve that symmetry."
1008,"When dividing an integer by a fraction, thinks they multiply numerator and denominator by the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing an integer by a fraction and mistakenly believe that they can simply multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the integer. They may think that this process will somehow ""cancel out"" the fraction, leading them to an incorrect solution.

For example, when dividing 6 by 1/2, students with this misconception may multiply the numerator (1) and denominator (2) by 6, resulting in 6/12, which they may then simplify to 1/2. 

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Dividing 8 by 1/4, where the student may multiply the numerator and denominator by 8, resulting in 8/32.
- Dividing 9 by 3/4, where the student may multiply the numerator and denominator by 9, resulting in 27/36.
- Dividing 12 by 2/3, where the student may multiply the numerator and denominator by 12, resulting in 24/36."
1009,Does not know the meaning of bisect,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unclear about the concept of bisecting in geometry. Bisecting involves dividing a shape or line into two equal parts. Students with this misconception may struggle to understand the significance of bisecting angles, lines, or shapes, leading to errors in geometric constructions, calculations, and problem-solving.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to construct an angle bisector, the student may draw a line that divides the angle into two unequal parts.
- When required to bisect a line segment, the student may divide it into two unequal parts or fail to understand the importance of using a perpendicular bisector.
- In problem-solving, the student may misunderstand the concept of bisecting in the context of shapes, such as bisecting a rectangle or a triangle, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions."
1010,Believes the largest number in a set of numbers is always their highest common factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of a set of numbers. They may believe that the HCF is the largest number in the set, rather than the largest number that divides all the numbers in the set without leaving a remainder. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the definition and properties of HCF, and may be due to a superficial understanding of the concept or a failure to grasp the underlying mathematical principles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the HCF of a set of numbers, a student may simply choose the largest number in the set as the answer, without checking whether it divides the other numbers evenly.
- When comparing the HCFs of different sets of numbers, a student may assume that the set with the largest numbers will always have the largest HCF.
- When solving problems involving fractions or ratios, a student may incorrectly simplify fractions by using the largest number in the numerator or denominator as the HCF, rather than finding the actual HCF of the numbers involved.
- When working with real-world applications of HCF, such as measuring lengths or quantities, a student may mistakenly assume that the largest measurement or quantity is the HCF of the set, rather than finding the actual HCF."
1011,Does not know the distributive property,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not understand that the distributive property allows them to distribute a single value or operation across multiple values or operations. In the context of multiplication over addition or subtraction, students may not recognize that a single value can be multiplied to multiple values separately. 

For example, in the expression 3(4 + 5), students with this misconception may not know that they can multiply the 3 to both the 4 and the 5 separately, resulting in 3*4 + 3*5 = 12 + 15 = 27. Instead, they may try to add 4 and 5 first and then multiply, which is correct but doesn't demonstrate an understanding of the distributive property.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Expanding algebraic expressions: 2(x + 3) 
- Multiplying numbers with multiple digits: 4(20 + 5)
- Solving word problems: Tom has 3 bags, each containing 4 apples and 5 oranges. How many fruits does Tom have in total?"
1012,Squares when asked to find the square root,"Explanation: A common misconception students have is that when they're asked to find the square root of a number, they think it means finding the square of the number instead. This is because the words ""square"" and ""square root"" are often confused with each other. The students might recall the process of squaring a number, which involves multiplying it by itself, and incorrectly apply this process when asked to find the square root.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the square root of a perfect square, they might give the square of the number instead. For example, if asked to find the square root of 16, they might answer 256 (which is 16^2) instead of 4.
- When solving equations that involve square roots, students might square the number instead of finding its square root, leading to incorrect solutions.
- In geometry, when finding the length of a side of a square or a right-angled triangle, students might square the given values instead of finding their square roots, resulting in incorrect lengths.
- In data analysis, when dealing with data that involves square roots, such as standard deviation, students might apply the squaring process instead, leading to incorrect results."
1013,Answers as if there are 100 minutes in an hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 minutes in an hour, instead of the correct 60 minutes. This error may stem from a misunderstanding of the relationship between minutes and hours, or a simple arithmetic mistake. Students with this misconception may have difficulty accurately converting between hours and minutes, leading to incorrect calculations and time estimations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting hours to minutes, a student may multiply the number of hours by 100 instead of 60, resulting in an incorrect total number of minutes.
- When comparing the duration of events, a student may mistakenly assume that an event lasting 100 minutes is equal to 1 hour, when in fact it is approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes.
- When solving problems involving elapsed time, a student may incorrectly calculate the time difference between two events, leading to incorrect answers.
- When reading analog clocks, a student may misinterpret the hour and minute hands, believing that each hour represents 100 minutes instead of 60."
1014,Believes the frequency of the midpoint of a group is half the total frequency of the group,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of frequency distribution in grouped data. They incorrectly assume that the midpoint of a group, also known as the class midpoint or class mark, has a frequency that is half the total frequency of the group. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of midpoints and how frequencies are distributed within a group.

In reality, the frequency of the midpoint is not necessarily half the total frequency of the group. The frequency of the midpoint is simply the number of data points that fall within the group, and it can be any value depending on the data distribution.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A student is given a histogram with equal class intervals and is asked to find the frequency of the midpoint of a particular group. They may assume that the frequency of the midpoint is half the total frequency of the group, leading to incorrect calculations.

2. In a data analysis problem, a student is asked to find the mean of a grouped dataset. They may use the midpoint of each group to estimate the mean, but incorrectly assume that the frequency of the midpoint is half the total frequency, leading to an incorrect calculation of the mean.

3. A student is creating a frequency distribution table for a dataset and needs to determine the frequency of the midpoint of a group. They may fall into this misconception and incorrectly record the frequency of the midpoint as half the total frequency, leading to an incorrect frequency distribution table.

4. When comparing two datasets, a student may assume that the midpoint of a group in one dataset has half the frequency of the total group, leading to incorrect comparisons and conclusions about the datasets."
1015,"When answering questions regarding adding items to get a new ratio, looks at the difference between the numbers in the original and new ratio rather than finding the size of a part","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to solve problems involving equivalent ratios, where they need to find the missing value in a new ratio. Instead of understanding that the ratio is a comparison of parts to the whole, and that equivalent ratios have the same proportion of parts, students mistakenly focus on the difference between the corresponding numbers in the original and new ratios.

They might think that if the original ratio is 2:3 and the new ratio is x:6, they would look at the difference between the second parts (6 - 3 = 3) and apply the same difference to the first part (2 + 3 = 5), resulting in an incorrect answer.

This misconception shows that students do not fully grasp the concept of equivalent ratios and are not thinking about the proportional relationship between the parts.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- A recipe requires a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar. If you want to make a larger batch using 6 cups of sugar, how many cups of flour do you need?
- A school has a student-teacher ratio of 5:1. If the school hires more teachers and the new ratio becomes x:4, how many students are there for every 4 teachers?
- A car travels 250 miles in 5 hours. If it travels for 8 hours at the same rate, how many miles does it cover?"
1016,Confuses the hundreds and hundred thousands place value columns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the positioning of digits within a large number. They struggle to differentiate between the hundreds and hundred thousands place value columns, often leading to incorrect readings or writings of numbers. This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the base-10 number system or insufficient practice in reading and writing large numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading or writing numbers greater than 100,000, such as 143,219, where students may mistakenly identify the '1' as being in the hundreds place instead of the hundred thousands place.
- When comparing numbers, such as 145,000 and 1,450, where students may incorrectly state that 1,450 is larger due to the misplaced understanding of the hundreds and hundred thousands places.
- When performing arithmetic operations, such as adding or subtracting numbers with multiple digits, where students may misalign numbers due to their misunderstanding of place value columns."
1017,Does not understand how to solve linear two step equations,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to solve linear two-step equations, which require two operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to isolate the variable. They may have difficulty deciding which operation to perform first, or they may perform the operations in the wrong order. This can lead to incorrect solutions or incomplete work.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* When solving an equation like 2x + 5 = 11, students may try to subtract 2 from both sides instead of subtracting 5 first.
* When solving an equation like x/4 + 2 = 5, students may try to multiply both sides by 4 without first subtracting 2.
* When solving an equation like 3x - 2 = 7, students may try to add 2 to both sides without first dividing both sides by 3.
* When solving an equation like x/2 - 3 = 2, students may try to add 3 to both sides without first multiplying both sides by 2."
1018,Thinks the fraction 1/n can express sharing n items between any number of people,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of fractions, specifically the part-whole relationship represented by the fraction 1/n. They may believe that the fraction 1/n can be used to describe sharing n items among any number of people, rather than understanding that it specifically represents one equal part out of a total of n parts.

For example, students with this misconception may think that 1/6 means one item shared among any number of people, rather than one item being one-sixth of the total. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect applications of fractions in real-world scenarios.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: If Sara has 6 cookies and she wants to share them among her friends, a student with this misconception may think that 1/6 represents one cookie shared among 2, 3, or 10 friends, rather than specifically representing one-sixth of the total number of cookies.
- Case 2: When solving a problem that involves dividing a pizza among a group of people, a student with this misconception may incorrectly apply the fraction 1/n to represent the share of pizza each person gets, regardless of the total number of people.
- Case 3: In a scenario where a toy box contains 6 toys to be shared among a group of children, a student with this misconception may think that 1/6 represents one toy shared among any number of children, rather than understanding that it represents one-sixth of the total number of toys."
1019,Believes class width = frequency density,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the class width in a grouped data set is equal to the frequency density. Class width refers to the range of values in a particular class or group, whereas frequency density is a measure of how often a value occurs within a given class, usually calculated by dividing the frequency by the class width. This misconception may lead students to incorrectly interpret data and make inaccurate conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When creating histograms, students may label the y-axis as class width instead of frequency density, resulting in incorrect scaling.
2. In calculations, students might use the class width as a substitute for frequency density, leading to incorrect calculations of mean, median, or mode.
3. When comparing data sets, students might assume that classes with the same width have the same frequency density, which is not necessarily true.
4. In data analysis, students may misinterpret the distribution of data, thinking that a wider class width indicates a higher frequency density, when in fact, it only indicates a broader range of values."
1020,Believes it's not possible to solve simultaneous equations graphically,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations using algebraic methods, such as substitution or elimination. They may assume that graphical methods are only used for simple linear equations and not for more complex systems of equations. As a result, they may think that it's not possible to solve simultaneous equations graphically, or that it's not a valid or reliable method.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to solve a system of two linear equations with two variables, and they immediately resort to algebraic methods without considering graphical approaches.
* When students are given a pair of linear equations with different slopes and y-intercepts, and they struggle to visualize how these lines intersect, leading them to doubt the effectiveness of graphical methods.
* When students are faced with a system of non-linear equations, such as quadratic or circular equations, and they assume that graphical methods are not applicable in these cases.
* When students are asked to find the solution to a system of equations in a real-world context, such as finding the point of intersection of two lines on a map, and they don't consider using graphical methods to solve the problem."
1021,Believes an outlier is not determined by distance from the mean,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that an outlier is solely determined by its extremity or unusualness in a dataset, rather than its distance from the mean. They might think that any data point that seems unusual or is at the extreme ends of the data set is an outlier, without considering whether it is actually far away from the mean. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify data points as outliers based on superficial characteristics, rather than a thorough analysis of the data. They may also overlook the importance of the mean in determining what constitutes an outlier.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When analyzing a dataset with a small range of values, a student might identify the highest or lowest value as an outlier simply because it is the most extreme, without considering whether it is actually far away from the mean.

2. When looking at a dataset with multiple extreme values, a student might assume that all of these values are outliers, without evaluating their distance from the mean.

3. When dealing with a dataset that has a skewed distribution, a student might misidentify data points as outliers due to their position in the distribution, rather than their actual distance from the mean.

4. When comparing two datasets with different means and ranges, a student might incorrectly identify data points as outliers based on their position in one dataset, without considering the mean and distribution of the other dataset."
1022,Believes you multiply matching bases when carrying out a multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying numbers with the same base but different exponents. They incorrectly assume that when multiplying numbers with the same base, they simply multiply the bases together, rather than adding the exponents. For example, when multiplying 2^3 and 2^4, they might think the answer is 2 * 2 = 4, rather than understanding that the bases are the same and the exponents should be added, resulting in 2^(3+4).

This misconception can occur in the following short cases:

- Multiplying numbers with the same base in algebra, such as 3^2 * 3^5
- Simplifying expressions with exponents, such as (2^3) * (2^2)
- Solving problems involving exponential growth or decay, where numbers with the same base need to be multiplied
- Working with scientific notation, where numbers are expressed in the form a * 10^b, and need to be multiplied together."
1023,Believes that the complement of a set in a triple Venn consists of the elements that only belong to one other set,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with triple Venn diagrams, which involve three overlapping sets. They may mistakenly believe that the complement of a set (i.e., the set of elements that are not in the original set) consists only of the elements that belong to one other set, but not to the intersection of the other two sets or the region outside all three sets.

For example, in a triple Venn diagram with sets A, B, and C, a student with this misconception might think that the complement of set A (denoted as A') consists only of the elements that are in set B or set C, but not in both, and not in the region outside all three sets.

This misconception can lead to errors when working with set operations, such as finding the union, intersection, or difference of sets.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When finding the complement of a set in a triple Venn diagram, a student might write A' = B ∪ C, instead of considering the entire region outside set A, including the intersection of B and C, and the region outside all three sets.
* When solving problems involving set operations, a student might incorrectly simplify expressions, such as (A ∩ B)' = C, instead of considering the entire complement of the intersection of A and B.
* When interpreting real-world scenarios involving sets, a student might mistakenly identify the complement of a set as only the elements that belong to one other set, rather than considering the entire context."
1024,When solving an equation thinks they add when in fact they need to multiply,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between numbers and operations in an equation. They might incorrectly assume that the presence of a number or a variable next to another number implies addition, rather than multiplication. This can be due to a lack of understanding of algebraic notation, where the absence of a multiplication symbol (×) is assumed to be multiplication.

For example, in the equation 2x = 6, students with this misconception might think that 2 is added to x, rather than 2 being multiplied by x. This can lead to incorrect solutions and a misunderstanding of the equation's underlying structure.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Solving linear equations: 3x = 9, where students might think 3 is added to x instead of multiplied.
2. Simplifying expressions: 2(3x), where students might think 2 is added to 3x instead of multiplied.
3. Word problems: ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils each"", where students might think the answer is 3 + 4 instead of 3 × 4."
1025,Forgets to include the intersection value when asked for total value of a set in a Venn diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with Venn diagrams, which are used to visualize the relationships between sets. In a Venn diagram, the intersection is the area where two or more sets overlap, representing the elements that are common to both sets. When asked to find the total value of a set, students might forget to include the intersection value, only counting the elements that are unique to that set. This can lead to an incorrect total value, as the intersection value is an essential part of the set.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A Venn diagram shows the number of students who play soccer, basketball, or both. The student is asked to find the total number of students who play soccer, but forgets to include the students who play both soccer and basketball.
- A Venn diagram illustrates the number of people who like reading books, watching movies, or both. The student is asked to find the total number of people who like reading books but fails to include the people who enjoy both activities.
- A Venn diagram represents the number of cars that are red, have four doors, or both. The student is asked to find the total number of cars that are red, but neglects to include the cars that are both red and have four doors."
1026,Does not reverse the order of operations when finding the input of a function machine,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with function machines, which are often used to represent simple functions. When given a function machine and an output value, students are asked to find the input value that produced the given output. However, some students may incorrectly assume that they can simply perform the operations in the same order as the function machine to ""undo"" the process and find the input. They fail to recognize that the inverse operations need to be performed in the reverse order to obtain the original input.

For example, consider a function machine that multiplies the input by 2 and then adds 3. If the output is 11, students with this misconception may try to find the input by first subtracting 3 and then dividing by 2, rather than reversing the order of operations by first subtracting 3 and then dividing the result by 2.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A function machine adds 5 to the input and then multiplies the result by 2. If the output is 16, a student with this misconception may try to find the input by first dividing 16 by 2 and then subtracting 5, rather than reversing the order of operations.
- Case 2: A function machine subtracts 2 from the input and then divides the result by 3. If the output is 2, a student with this misconception may try to find the input by first multiplying 2 by 3 and then adding 2, rather than reversing the order of operations.
- Case 3: A function machine multiplies the input by 4 and then subtracts 1. If the output is 11, a student with this misconception may try to find the input by first adding 1 and then dividing by 4, rather than reversing the order of operations."
1027,Believes the median is the frequency for the middle category in a table,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the median in the context of grouped data, particularly in tables or histograms. They may mistakenly believe that the median is simply the frequency or value associated with the middle category or class, rather than understanding it as the middle value of the entire dataset when it is arranged in order.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When working with discrete data, students may focus on the category with the highest frequency, thinking that the median is the number of occurrences in that category, rather than finding the actual middle value.
- In histograms or bar charts, students might incorrectly identify the median as the height of the middle bar, which represents the frequency, rather than considering the cumulative frequencies to determine the median.
- When dealing with grouped data, students may assume that the median is the midpoint of the modal class (the class with the highest frequency), rather than understanding that the median is a value that divides the data into two equal parts.
- In tables with an even number of data points, students might mistakenly take the frequency of the middle two categories and assume that is the median, instead of finding the average of the two middle values."
1028,Multiplies up without finding unit price in proportion question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with proportion problems involving prices and quantities. Instead of finding the unit price (price per unit of an item) and using it to solve the problem, students tend to multiply the given price by a factor, without considering the actual relationship between the price and the quantity. This can lead to incorrect solutions, as the student is not taking into account the proportional relationship between the variables.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* A recipe for 4 people requires 2 bags of flour, each costing $5. How much will it cost to make the recipe for 6 people? (Student may multiply $10 by 1.5, instead of finding the unit price per person)
* A car travels 120 miles in 3 hours, using 12 gallons of fuel. If fuel costs $2 per gallon, how much will it cost to travel 180 miles? (Student may multiply $24 by 1.5, instead of finding the unit price per mile)
* A bookshelf has 5 shelves, each holding 8 books. If the bookshelf costs $120, how much will a bookshelf with 7 shelves cost? (Student may multiply $120 by 1.4, instead of finding the unit price per shelf)"
1029,Does not understand that a line graph shows a relationship between 2 variables,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that a line graph is used to display the relationship between two variables, often with one variable on the x-axis (independent variable) and the other on the y-axis (dependent variable). They may mistakenly believe that a line graph is simply a way to show a sequence of events or to compare different categories.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to create a graph to show how a quantity changes over time, they might use a line graph without understanding that the line represents the relationship between the time (independent variable) and the quantity (dependent variable).
- When students are given a set of data and asked to choose the most suitable type of graph to display it, they might choose a line graph without considering whether the data shows a relationship between two variables.
- When interpreting a line graph, students might focus solely on the individual data points without recognizing the overall trend or relationship between the variables that the line represents.
- When students are asked to describe the relationship between two variables shown on a line graph, they might struggle to identify the relationship or mistakenly describe it as a simple comparison between categories."
1030,When dividing numbers with the same base divides the base numbers and the powers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with division of numbers with the same base raised to different powers. They mistakenly believe that dividing these numbers involves dividing the base numbers and the powers separately. 

For instance, when dividing 6^8 by 6^4, students with this misconception may think that they need to divide the bases (6 ÷ 6) and the powers (8 ÷ 4), rather than applying the correct rule for dividing numbers with the same base. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and the rules for dividing numbers with the same base.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Dividing 2^6 by 2^3
- Simplifying the expression 4^8 ÷ 4^2
- Evaluating the expression (3^9) / (3^5)"
1031,Believes raising a negative number to an odd power will give a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students incorrectly apply the rule that raising a negative number to a power will always result in a positive answer. They may have learned that squaring a negative number gives a positive result (e.g., (-2)^2 = 4), and incorrectly generalize this to all exponents. However, when the exponent is odd, the negative sign is preserved, not changed. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and negative numbers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Simplifying expressions with negative bases and odd exponents, such as (-3)^3 or (-2)^5
* Solving equations with negative numbers and odd exponents, such as (-x)^3 = -8
* Graphing functions with negative bases and odd exponents, such as y = (-x)^3
* Working with real-world problems that involve negative numbers and odd exponents, such as calculating the volume of a cube with a negative side length."
1032,Confuses cube rooting with squaring a number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of cube roots and squaring numbers. They might think that finding the cube root of a number is the same as squaring it, or vice versa. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the fundamental differences between these two mathematical operations.

Cube rooting involves finding a number that, when multiplied by itself twice, gives the original value. On the other hand, squaring a number involves multiplying it by itself once. This misconception may stem from the fact that both operations involve exponentiation, but the exponent and the operation are different.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying expressions involving cube roots and squares, students might incorrectly apply the rules of one operation to the other.
- When solving equations involving cube roots and squares, students might mistakenly square a number instead of finding its cube root, or vice versa.
- In word problems involving volumes of cubes or squares, students might incorrectly apply the wrong operation, leading to incorrect solutions.

For example:

- Case 1: A student is asked to find the cube root of 64. They might incorrectly square 8 (since 8^2 = 64) and give the answer as 64, instead of finding the cube root of 64, which is actually 4.
- Case 2: A student is asked to find the area of a square with a side length of 4 units. They might incorrectly find the cube root of 4 instead of squaring 4, leading to an incorrect answer."
1033,Does not know that you can have a decimal percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are under the impression that percentages can only be whole numbers. They may believe that percentages must be integers, such as 25%, 50%, or 75%, and are unfamiliar with the concept of decimal percentages, like 25.5% or 0.5%. This misunderstanding can stem from limited exposure to real-world applications of percentages or an incomplete understanding of how percentages are calculated and represented.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When calculating interest rates or investment returns that are not whole numbers, such as a 4.25% interest rate on a savings account.
* When dealing with statistics, like a survey result showing that 42.7% of respondents prefer a particular product.
* When working with measurement errors or tolerances, such as a machine part with a 0.5% margin of error.
* When calculating discounts or markups in retail, such as a 10.5% discount on a sale item.
* When analyzing data, like a graph showing a 3.2% increase in sales over a certain period."
1034,believes the complement of a set consists of elements which only belong to one set,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of set complement. They may think that the complement of a set only includes elements that are unique to one set and do not overlap with any other set. In reality, the complement of a set includes all elements that are not in the original set, regardless of whether they belong to other sets or not.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify the complement of a set, especially when dealing with multiple sets and their relationships.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When finding the complement of a set within a universal set, students may exclude elements that are common to other sets.
2. When working with Venn diagrams, students may incorrectly shade the regions that represent the complement of a set, missing the overlapping regions.
3. In problems involving set operations, such as union and intersection, students may miscalculate the result due to a misunderstanding of the complement.
4. When solving problems involving probability and events, students may incorrectly calculate the probability of the complement of an event, leading to incorrect results."
1035,"When multiplying a decimal less than 1 by an integer, gives an answer 10 times smaller than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of decimal multiplication. They may think that multiplying a decimal less than 1 by an integer will result in a much smaller answer, often 10 times smaller than the actual result. For example, if asked to calculate 0.5 x 6, they may answer 0.06, instead of the correct answer, 3.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Multiplying a decimal less than 1 by a single-digit integer: 0.4 x 3 (students may answer 0.04 instead of 1.2)
- Multiplying a decimal less than 1 by a multi-digit integer: 0.2 x 14 (students may answer 0.02 instead of 2.8)
- Word problems involving real-life scenarios: If a book costs $0.8 and you buy 5 books, how much will you pay in total? (students may answer $0.08 instead of $4)"
1036,"Only gives 1 value of x for a given value of y, when reading from a parabolic graph","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the relationship between x and y values on a parabolic graph. They may assume that for a given value of y, there is only one corresponding value of x. This misunderstanding can occur due to a lack of understanding of the nature of quadratic relationships and the shape of parabolas, which can have two x-intercepts or points with the same y-coordinate but different x-coordinates.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding x-intercepts or solutions to a quadratic equation, students may only identify one solution instead of two.
- When solving problems that involve finding the x-value(s) corresponding to a given y-value on a parabola, students may only provide one answer.
- When graphing a parabola, students may not recognize that the curve can have two points with the same y-coordinate but different x-coordinates.
- When analyzing real-world data that follows a parabolic pattern, students may misinterpret the results by assuming there is only one solution or x-value for a given y-value."
1037,Believes time = speed x distance,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly rearrange the formula for calculating distance (distance = speed x time) and believe that time is the product of speed and distance. They may think that as speed and distance increase, time will also increase, which is incorrect. This misconception shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between these three variables.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving problems involving constant speeds, students may incorrectly calculate the time taken for an object to travel a certain distance.
- When comparing the time taken for different objects to travel the same distance at different speeds, students may mistakenly conclude that the object with the higher speed takes longer.
- When analyzing real-world scenarios, such as travel times for different modes of transportation, students may misapply the formula and arrive at incorrect conclusions."
1038,Thinks reciprocal button raises to a power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the function of the reciprocal button (usually denoted as '1/x' on calculators) and believe that it raises a number to a power, rather than calculating its reciprocal. The reciprocal of a number is actually 1 divided by that number. Students with this misconception may think that pressing the reciprocal button will increase or decrease the value of the number by raising it to a certain power, rather than flipping the number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When using calculators to find the reciprocal of a fraction or a decimal, students might interpret the result as the number being raised to a power.
- In algebra, when solving equations involving fractions or rational expressions, students might mistakenly use the reciprocal button to try to simplify or solve the equation, thinking it will raise the value to a power.
- When working with trigonometry and using the reciprocal button to find the reciprocal of a trigonometric function (e.g., 1/sin(x)), students may think it raises the function to a power rather than finding its reciprocal."
1039,Believes finding a percentage of an amount involves adding the percentage to 10% of the amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding a percentage of an amount. They incorrectly assume that to find a percentage of an amount, they need to first find 10% of the amount and then add the required percentage to it. For example, if they are asked to find 25% of 200, they would first find 10% of 200 (which is 20) and then add 25 to it (or add 15, since 25 - 10 = 15), resulting in an incorrect answer of 35.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding 15% of 500: Student may find 10% of 500 (which is 50) and then add 5 to it, resulting in an incorrect answer of 55.
- Calculating a 20% discount on a £100 item: Student may find 10% of £100 (which is £10) and then add £10 to it, resulting in an incorrect answer of £20 discount.
- Determining 35% of 800: Student may find 10% of 800 (which is 80) and then add 25 to it (or add 25, since 35 - 10 = 25), resulting in an incorrect answer of 105."
1040,Does not measure bearing clockwise from the north line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to measure bearings in a map or diagram, but instead of measuring the angle clockwise from the north line (0° or 360°), they measure it counterclockwise or from a different reference point. This can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions in problems involving navigation, geography, and trigonometry.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is asked to find the bearing of a landmark from a given location on a map, and they measure the angle counterclockwise from the east line instead of clockwise from the north line.
2. In a navigation problem, a student is given the bearings of two landmarks and is asked to find their position, but they measure the bearings counterclockwise, resulting in incorrect calculations.
3. A student is asked to draw a diagram showing the bearing of a ship from a lighthouse, and they draw the angle counterclockwise from the south line instead of clockwise from the north line.
4. In a geography lesson, a student is asked to identify the direction of a city from a given location using bearings, but they measure the angle from the west line instead of the north line, resulting in an incorrect answer."
1041,Does not know a rhombus is a type of parallelogram ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize that a rhombus is a specific type of parallelogram. A rhombus has all the properties of a parallelogram, including opposite sides being parallel and equal in length, and opposite angles being equal. However, students may mistakenly believe that a rhombus is a distinct and separate shape from a parallelogram, rather than being a subset of parallelograms with the additional property of all sides having equal length.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify and classify different types of quadrilaterals, they may list rhombus and parallelogram as separate categories without recognizing the overlap.
* When solving problems that involve properties of parallelograms, students may not apply these properties to rhombi, treating them as distinct shapes.
* In geometry problems that require students to find the perimeter or area of a rhombus, they may not use the properties of parallelograms to simplify the problem.
* When asked to provide examples of different types of parallelograms, students may not include rhombi in their list."
1042,"When dividing a number written in standard form by an integer, thinks you divide the power on the ten rather than the number component.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers written in standard form (also known as scientific notation) by integers. They mistakenly believe that they need to divide the power of 10 (the exponent) by the integer, rather than dividing the number component (the coefficient) by the integer. This shows a lack of understanding of the properties of standard form and how to perform operations with numbers in this form.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dividing 4.5 × 10^6 by 3, a student with this misconception may write (4.5 ÷ 3) × 10^(6 ÷ 3) = 1.5 × 10^2, instead of dividing only the coefficient 4.5 by 3 and leaving the power of 10 unchanged.
- When solving a problem that involves dividing 9.2 × 10^8 by 4, a student with this misconception may attempt to divide the exponent 8 by 4, resulting in an incorrect solution.
- When working on a calculation that involves dividing 2.1 × 10^5 by 7, a student with this misconception may mistakenly divide the power of 10 (5) by 7, rather than dividing the coefficient 2.1 by 7."
1043,Mixes up cubes and cuboids,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between cubes and cuboids, often using the terms interchangeably or incorrectly identifying one as the other. A cube is a three-dimensional shape with six square faces of equal size, while a cuboid is a three-dimensional shape with six rectangular faces, where the length, width, and height can be different. Students may mistakenly believe that any rectangular prism is a cube, or vice versa.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify and name different 3D shapes, they might incorrectly label a cuboid as a cube or vice versa.
* When calculating the volume or surface area of a shape, students may apply the formula for a cube to a cuboid, or vice versa, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When solving problems involving real-life objects, such as building blocks or boxes, students may misidentify the shape of the object, leading to incorrect conclusions or calculations.
* When working with nets or diagrams of 3D shapes, students may struggle to visualize and correctly identify the shape, leading to confusion between cubes and cuboids."
1044,Misremembers the quadratic formula,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly recall the quadratic formula, which is used to solve quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. The quadratic formula is often memorized as a procedure, but if students don't understand the underlying concept, they may misremember it. This can lead to incorrect solutions to quadratic equations.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving quadratic equations, such as x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, a student may incorrectly recall the formula as x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4a)) / 2a, forgetting the 'c' term.
- When faced with a quadratic equation in a different form, such as x^2 - 7x = 0, a student may incorrectly apply the misremembered quadratic formula.
- In a high-pressure situation, such as a test or exam, a student may misremember the quadratic formula due to stress or time constraints.
- When working with more complex quadratic equations, such as those with coefficients that are not integers, a student may incorrectly apply the misremembered quadratic formula, leading to incorrect solutions."
1045,"Believes reading from a cumulative frequency diagram will give the frequency above a certain value, rather than below","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misinterpret the concept of a cumulative frequency diagram. They mistakenly believe that the value read from the diagram represents the number of data points above a certain value, rather than the total number of data points below or equal to that value. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from the data.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to find the number of students who scored above a certain mark in an exam, a student might incorrectly read the cumulative frequency diagram and give the frequency of students who scored below that mark instead.
- When analyzing data on the heights of people, a student might mistakenly conclude that the cumulative frequency diagram shows the number of people taller than a certain height, rather than the number of people shorter than or equal to that height.
- When interpreting data on the time taken to complete a task, a student might incorrectly believe that the cumulative frequency diagram shows the number of tasks that took longer than a certain time, rather than the number of tasks that took less than or equal to that time."
1046,Does not understand remainders in division,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of remainders in division. They may believe that the remainder is simply the amount ""left over"" without understanding its relationship to the divisor and dividend. This can lead to difficulties in interpreting and calculating remainders, especially when dealing with word problems or real-world applications.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When dividing a number by another and the result is not a whole number, e.g., 17 ÷ 5 = ?, students may not understand that the remainder (2) represents the amount left over after dividing 17 into groups of 5.
- In word problems, such as ""Tom has 18 cookies and wants to package them in boxes of 4. How many boxes can he make?"", students may not account for the remainder, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with different types of remainders, such as those resulting from dividing decimals or fractions, students may become confused about how to interpret and calculate the remainder.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a quantity of materials, students may not understand how to handle remainders, leading to errors or inaccuracies.
- When solving problems that involve multiple steps, such as multi-digit division or division with regrouping, students may struggle to keep track of remainders and make mistakes as a result."
1047,Estimates a measurement on a diagram rather than working it out,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the measurement of a particular part of a diagram, such as the length of a line segment or the size of an angle. Instead of using mathematical techniques or tools (e.g., rulers, protractors) to accurately calculate the measurement, they make a rough estimate based on visual inspection of the diagram. This can lead to inaccurate answers and a lack of understanding of mathematical concepts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A student is given a diagram of a rectangle and asked to find the length of its diagonal. Instead of using the Pythagorean theorem, they estimate the length based on how long it looks compared to the sides.
* Case 2: A student is given a diagram of a triangle and asked to find the size of one of its angles. Instead of using a protractor or angle properties, they estimate the angle size based on how ""pointy"" or ""wide"" it appears.
* Case 3: A student is given a diagram of a circle and asked to find the circumference. Instead of using the formula C = 2πr, they estimate the circumference based on how ""big"" the circle looks."
1048,"When adding/subtracting fractions, adds/subtracts the denominators and multiplies the numerators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of adding and subtracting fractions. They incorrectly assume that to add or subtract fractions, one simply adds or subtracts the denominators (the numbers at the bottom of the fraction) and multiplies the numerators (the numbers at the top of the fraction). This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of clear understanding of equivalent ratios, the purpose of finding common denominators, or inadequate practice with fraction operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When adding fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6, a student might incorrectly add the denominators (4 + 6 = 10) and multiply the numerators (1 * 1 = 1), resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/10.
- When subtracting fractions with the same numerator, e.g., 2/5 - 2/3, a student might incorrectly subtract the denominators (5 - 3 = 2) and multiply the numerators (2 * 2 = 4), resulting in an incorrect answer of 4/2.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with the same denominator but different numerators, e.g., 3/8 + 2/8, a student might still apply the misconception and incorrectly add the denominators (8 + 8 = 16) and multiply the numerators (3 * 2 = 6), resulting in an incorrect answer of 6/16."
1049,Misunderstands the process of making a variable the subject of an equation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to isolate a specific variable in an equation, often due to a lack of understanding of the inverse operations required to solve for that variable. They may incorrectly apply operations, fail to perform the operations in the correct order, or not perform the operations to both sides of the equation. This can lead to incorrect solutions or incomplete isolation of the variable.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* Case 1: The student is given the equation 2x + 5 = 11 and is asked to solve for x. They may add 5 to both sides instead of subtracting 5, resulting in an incorrect solution.
* Case 2: The student is given the equation x/4 = 9 and is asked to solve for x. They may multiply both sides by 2 instead of 4, or not multiply both sides at all, resulting in an incorrect solution.
* Case 3: The student is given the equation 3x - 2 = 14 and is asked to solve for x. They may add 2 to both sides, but then fail to divide both sides by 3, resulting in an incomplete isolation of the variable.
* Case 4: The student is given the equation x + 2 = 9 and is asked to solve for x. They may subtract 3 from both sides instead of 2, or subtract 2 from only one side, resulting in an incorrect solution."
1050,Thinks there are 10g in a kilogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between grams (g) and kilograms (kg). They may think that 1 kilogram is composed of 10 units of grams, rather than understanding that 1 kilogram is actually equal to 1000 grams. This error can stem from a lack of understanding of the metric system and the prefixes used to denote different units of measurement.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to convert 2 kilograms to grams, the student may answer 20 grams instead of 2000 grams.
- When comparing the weight of two objects, one weighing 500 grams and the other 1 kilogram, the student may think the 1 kilogram object is only slightly heavier than the 500-gram object, rather than being twice as heavy.
- When solving a problem that involves adding or subtracting weights in grams and kilograms, the student may incorrectly convert between the two units, leading to an incorrect answer."
1051,"When multiplying by a multiple of 10, gives an answer 10 times bigger than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of place value and the effect of multiplying by multiples of 10. They may think that multiplying by a multiple of 10 simply adds a 0 to the end of the original number, rather than understanding that each digit in the number is shifted one place to the left for every factor of 10.

For example, when multiplying 5 by 20, students with this misconception may think that the answer is 500, rather than understanding that the 5 should be multiplied by 20, resulting in 100.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying single-digit numbers by multiples of 10 (e.g., 3 × 10, 5 × 20)
- When multiplying multi-digit numbers by multiples of 10 (e.g., 14 × 10, 25 × 30)
- When solving real-world problems involving scaling or enlargement (e.g., ""If I have 5 boxes, and each box can hold 10 items, how many items can I hold in total if I have 20 boxes?"")"
1052,Uses length scale factor for volume without cubing,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when a 3D shape is enlarged or reduced by a certain scale factor, its volume will change by the same scale factor as its length. They fail to recognize that the volume of a 3D shape changes by the cube of the scale factor applied to its length. As a result, they incorrectly apply the length scale factor to the original volume without cubing it, leading to incorrect calculations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the volume of similar 3D shapes, such as two similar cubes or spheres, and the student only multiplies the original volume by the length scale factor instead of cubing it.
- When solving problems involving proportional changes in 3D shapes, such as ""If a cube has its edge length doubled, what is the new volume?"" and the student simply doubles the original volume instead of multiplying it by 2^3.
- When working with real-world applications, such as calculating the volume of a scaled-up or scaled-down model of a building or a container, and the student fails to account for the cubing of the scale factor in their calculations."
1053,"Believes that when converting ratio to fractions, the denominator is the product of the parts of the ratio","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of ratios and fractions. They think that to convert a ratio to a fraction, they need to multiply the parts of the ratio to get the denominator. For example, given a ratio of 2:3, they believe the fraction would be 2/(2*3) = 2/6, instead of understanding that the parts of the ratio represent the proportion of the whole.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Converting a ratio of 1:4 to a fraction, where the student will write 1/(1*4) = 1/4 instead of understanding it's actually 1/5.
- Converting a ratio of 3:2 to a fraction, where the student will write 3/(3*2) = 3/6 instead of understanding it's actually 3/5.
- Comparing ratios and fractions in problems involving scaling, proportions, or equivalent ratios, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
1054,Performs subtraction in wrong order,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly switch the order of numbers in a subtraction problem. They may subtract the larger number from the smaller number, instead of subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. This misconception can arise due to a lack of understanding of the concept of subtraction as finding the difference between two numbers, and not just an automatic reversal of addition.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

- 5 - 3: The student may write 3 - 5 instead, resulting in an incorrect answer of -2.
- 10 - 2: The student may write 2 - 10, leading to an incorrect answer of -8.
- 24 - 17: The student may subtract 24 from 17, resulting in an incorrect answer of -7."
1055,Does not notice all changes in a sequence of visual patterns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify or continue a sequence of visual patterns, but they fail to notice all the changes that are happening within the pattern. They might focus on one aspect of the pattern that is changing, while overlooking other changes that are also occurring. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the next item in the sequence or the underlying rule governing the pattern.

For example, in a sequence of shapes where both the color and the number of sides are changing, a student with this misconception might notice the change in color but not the change in the number of sides. They might then incorrectly predict the next shape in the sequence based solely on the color change, without taking into account the change in the number of sides.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- A sequence of shapes where the color and size are both changing, but the student only notices the change in color.
- A pattern of blocks where the number of blocks and the orientation of the blocks are both changing, but the student only notices the change in the number of blocks.
- A sequence of numbers where the digits and the font style are both changing, but the student only notices the change in the digits.
- A pattern of geometric shapes where the shape and the background color are both changing, but the student only notices the change in the shape."
1056,Chooses an incorrect point in between the shapes when describing a 90 or 270 degree rotation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to describe or visualize a rotation of a shape by 90 or 270 degrees. Instead of choosing the correct center of rotation (usually the origin or a specific point on the shape), they incorrectly choose a point that is not the center of rotation, often somewhere in between the original shape and its image after rotation.

This misconception can lead to incorrect descriptions of the rotation, as the student may try to rotate the shape around this incorrect point, resulting in an incorrect image.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When describing a 90-degree rotation of a square, a student chooses the midpoint of one of its sides as the center of rotation, instead of the center of the square.
* When visualizing a 270-degree rotation of a triangle, a student chooses a point outside the triangle, rather than the origin or the centroid of the triangle.
* When rotating a shape on a coordinate grid, a student chooses a point that is not the origin (0, 0), resulting in an incorrect image."
1057,Finds the unit fraction when asked to find a non-unit fraction of an amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a non-unit fraction (e.g., 3/4) of a given amount, but instead, they only find the unit fraction (e.g., 1/4) of the amount and fail to multiply it by the numerator (e.g., 3). As a result, they provide an answer that represents only one part of the total amount, rather than the required proportion.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find 2/3 of 18, a student finds 1/3 (which is 6) but fails to multiply it by 2, giving an incorrect answer of 6 instead of 12.
- When asked to find 3/4 of 24, a student finds 1/4 (which is 6) but fails to multiply it by 3, giving an incorrect answer of 6 instead of 18.
- When asked to find 5/6 of 30, a student finds 1/6 (which is 5) but fails to multiply it by 5, giving an incorrect answer of 5 instead of 25."
1058,"Believes that in the nth term of a descending sequence, b is the difference between the term and the positive multiple of n","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the nth term in an arithmetic sequence, particularly in a descending sequence. They incorrectly believe that the constant 'b' represents the difference between the term and a positive multiple of 'n', rather than understanding that 'b' is typically the starting value or a constant added/subtracted from the product of 'n' and the common difference.

For example, consider the sequence: 20, 17, 14, 11, ...

In this case, a student with this misconception might think that the 'b' in the nth term formula is the difference between each term and a positive multiple of 'n'. They might incorrectly write the formula as something like an = -3n + b, where 'b' is the difference between the term and a multiple of 'n'. However, this misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of the sequence.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the nth term of a descending arithmetic sequence.
- When determining the next term in a sequence that decreases by a constant difference.
- When solving problems that involve a decreasing pattern, such as the cost of items decreasing over time.
- When interpreting real-world data that exhibits a downward trend, such as the amount of money in a savings account decreasing over time.
- When comparing the rates of decrease between different sequences or scenarios."
1059,Does not know the definition of the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unsure or misunderstand the concept of ""range"" in the context of data and statistics. They may think that the range refers to all the values in a dataset, the highest value, the lowest value, or even the average value. They may also confuse the range with other statistical concepts, such as the median or mode.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the range of a set of numbers, a student might list all the numbers instead of finding the difference between the highest and lowest values.
- When comparing two datasets, a student might say that the dataset with the highest maximum value has the larger range, without considering the minimum value.
- When analyzing a graph or chart, a student might mistakenly identify the range as the highest point on the graph, rather than the difference between the highest and lowest points.
- When solving a problem that involves finding the range of a dataset, a student might calculate the mean or median instead, or perform some other unrelated calculation."
1060,Thinks positive values in a column vector denote movement left and down (and vice-versa for negative values).,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly reverse the conventional direction associated with positive and negative values in column vectors, particularly in the context of translations in geometry. Normally, in a column vector, a positive value in the top row represents movement to the right (or east), and a positive value in the bottom row represents movement up (or north). Similarly, a negative value in the top row represents movement to the left (or west), and a negative value in the bottom row represents movement down (or south). 

However, students with this misconception think that a positive value in the top row means moving left and a positive value in the bottom row means moving down. They also believe the opposite for negative values, thinking that a negative value in the top row indicates movement to the right and a negative value in the bottom row indicates movement up.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:
1. When describing translations in the coordinate plane using column vectors.
2. When performing calculations involving column vectors in the context of transformations in geometry.
3. When interpreting the results of adding or subtracting column vectors to determine the final position or image of a point after a sequence of translations."
1061,When asked to rotate by 90 degrees rotates by 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of rotation in geometry. They may struggle to visualize or understand the magnitude of a 90-degree rotation, leading them to rotate an object or shape by 180 degrees instead. This could be due to a lack of spatial awareness, difficulty in understanding angle measurements, or simply a misunderstanding of the instruction to ""rotate by 90 degrees.""

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When asked to rotate a shape in a math problem to create a new shape or pattern.
- In real-world applications, such as design or architecture, where rotating objects by specific angles is crucial.
- In tasks that require students to describe the effect of a rotation on a shape or object.
- When working with symmetries, where rotations by 90 degrees are used to create symmetrical patterns.
- In construction or engineering, where precise rotations are necessary to achieve desired outcomes."
1062,"When using the capture-recapture method of sampling, believes you divide the number caught second by the number marked second to find the best estimate of population size","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the formula used in the capture-recapture method of sampling. They incorrectly believe that to estimate the population size, they need to divide the total number of individuals caught in the second sample by the number of marked individuals recaptured in the second sample. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the purpose of marking individuals in the first sample and how it relates to estimating the population size.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are dealing with a capture-recapture problem and are asked to estimate the population size of a particular species.
- When students are working with real-world data from a capture-recapture study and need to apply the method to estimate population size.
- When students are comparing the effectiveness of different sampling methods, including capture-recapture, and need to calculate population estimates.
- When students are analyzing data from a study that used the capture-recapture method and need to interpret the results in the context of population size estimation."
1063,Adds rather than multiplies when asked for a total,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the total or overall amount in a situation that involves repeated groups or sets, but they incorrectly use addition instead of multiplication. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition. Students may think that simply adding the numbers together will give them the total, without considering the number of groups or sets involved.

Examples of cases when this misconception may occur:

* If Sally has 3 boxes of crayons, and each box contains 8 crayons, a student with this misconception may answer that Sally has 3 + 8 = 11 crayons, instead of multiplying 3 x 8 = 24 crayons.
* If a bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 6 books, a student with this misconception may answer that the bookshelf can hold 5 + 6 = 11 books, instead of multiplying 5 x 6 = 30 books.
* If a bakery sells 4 rows of cupcakes, with 8 cupcakes in each row, a student with this misconception may answer that the bakery sells 4 + 8 = 12 cupcakes, instead of multiplying 4 x 8 = 32 cupcakes."
1064,Confuses the union and intersection of inequalities,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with multiple inequalities and need to find the union or intersection of their solution sets. Students who hold this misconception often incorrectly combine the solution sets, leading to incorrect answers. They may mistakenly think that the union of two inequalities means the solutions that satisfy both inequalities simultaneously (which is actually the definition of intersection), or that the intersection of two inequalities means the solutions that satisfy either inequality (which is actually the definition of union). This confusion can lead to incorrect graphing of solution sets on number lines, incorrect answers to compound inequality questions, and a general lack of understanding of how to work with multiple inequalities.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When graphing the solution sets of two inequalities on a number line and being asked to find the union or intersection of the two solution sets.
* When solving compound inequalities, such as ""find the values of x that satisfy 2x > 3 and x < 5"".
* When working with systems of linear inequalities and needing to find the intersection of the solution sets of two or more inequalities.
* When answering questions that involve finding the union or intersection of two solution sets, such as ""what are the values of x that satisfy x > 2 or x < -3""."
1065,Does not recognise a unit of area in word form,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify or recognize units of area when they are written in word form, such as 'square centimetres' or 'square metres'. They may be familiar with the abbreviations (e.g., cm² or m²) but struggle to understand the equivalent word form. This can lead to difficulties in reading, writing, and interpreting measurements, particularly in real-world contexts where word forms are commonly used.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A recipe requires a piece of parchment paper that is 50 square centimetres in area. A student with this misconception may not recognize that 'square centimetres' refers to a unit of area.
2. A room is described as having a floor area of 20 square metres. A student with this misconception may not understand what 'square metres' means in this context.
3. A student is asked to find the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 metres and a width of 3 metres, and the answer is required in square metres. They may struggle to recognize that the unit 'square metres' is the correct unit of area."
1066,Does not think that the compensation strategy for the multiplication of 2 numbers is valid.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the compensation strategy in multiplication, but struggle to understand or accept its validity. The compensation strategy involves breaking down a multiplication problem into simpler parts by adding or subtracting a certain number to make the calculation easier. For example, when multiplying 19 x 7, a student might use the compensation strategy by calculating (20 x 7) - 7. However, some students may not think this strategy is valid, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the distributive property of multiplication or an over-reliance on memorization rather than understanding the underlying math concepts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying numbers close to 10 or multiples of 10 (e.g., 9 x 7, 19 x 5, 29 x 3).
- When multiplying numbers that can be broken down into simpler parts (e.g., 48 x 5 = (50 x 5) - (2 x 5)).
- When using real-world applications of multiplication, such as calculating the area of a room or the cost of items, where compensation strategies can be useful for mental math calculations."
1067,Confuses measures of turn (ie. degrees) and measures of length,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between units used to measure angles or turns (degrees) and units used to measure length (such as meters, centimeters, etc.). They may incorrectly apply the concept of length measurement to angles, thinking that degrees are a measure of distance rather than a measure of rotation. This can lead to misunderstandings in various mathematical contexts, particularly in geometry and measurement problems.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the perimeter of a shape and a student includes the angle measurements in degrees as part of their calculation.
- When a student is asked to turn an object by a certain angle and they attempt to measure it with a ruler instead of a protractor.
- When students are asked to find the length of an arc of a circle and they confuse the degree measure of the central angle with the length of the arc.
- When students are asked to solve problems involving the relationship between the angle of a slope and the length of the slope, and they incorrectly apply the concept of degrees as a measure of length."
1068,Believes the fx column for calculating mean is value + frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean from a frequency table. They incorrectly assume that to find the total sum of values in the dataset, they need to add the value and frequency together for each group, rather than multiplying the value by the frequency. This results in an incorrect calculation of the mean.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the mean from a frequency table, a student may write 2 + 3 in the fx column instead of 2 x 3, where 2 is the value and 3 is the frequency.
- If a dataset has a value of 5 occurring 4 times, a student with this misconception may calculate the total sum as 5 + 4 = 9, instead of the correct calculation of 5 x 4 = 20.
- When finding the mean of exam scores, a student might incorrectly add the score and the number of students who received that score, rather than multiplying them together."
1069,Assumes an angle is the size that it looks in the (not to scale) diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the size of an angle in a diagram is directly proportional to how it appears visually, rather than understanding that the actual size of the angle is determined by its measurement in degrees. They may assume that an angle that looks larger in a diagram is actually larger in terms of degrees, without considering the scale of the diagram or the actual measurements.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When working with diagrams that are not drawn to scale, students may assume that an angle that appears larger is actually larger, without checking the measurements.
- When comparing angles in different diagrams, students may assume that the angle that looks larger is actually larger, without considering the scale of each diagram.
- When solving problems involving angles in geometry, students may make incorrect assumptions about the size of angles based on how they appear in the diagram, rather than using measurements or calculations to determine the actual size.
- When working with optical illusions or 3D diagrams, students may be misled by the visual appearance of angles and assume they are larger or smaller than they actually are."
1070,Believes that dividing by 10 gives 1%,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between division by 10 and percentages. They incorrectly assume that dividing a number by 10 directly gives the result as a percentage, specifically 1%. This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of the concept of percentages, place value, and division. Students may think that moving the decimal point one place to the left (which is equivalent to dividing by 10) changes the value to 1% of the original number.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to find 1% of 500 and divides 500 by 10, thinking the result (50) is 1% of 500.
- When calculating a discount, a student divides the original price by 10 and assumes the result is a 1% discount.
- A student is asked to convert a fraction to a percentage and incorrectly divides the numerator by 10, thinking it gives the percentage value."
1071,Confuses obtuse and acute angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between obtuse and acute angles. They may mistakenly identify an obtuse angle (greater than 90 degrees) as an acute angle (less than 90 degrees), or vice versa. This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the definitions of these angle types or difficulty in visualizing and measuring angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When identifying angles in shapes: A student may incorrectly label an obtuse angle in a triangle as acute, or an acute angle in a triangle as obtuse.
2. When measuring angles with a protractor: A student may misread the protractor and record an obtuse angle as acute, or an acute angle as obtuse.
3. When comparing angles: A student may incorrectly compare the size of two angles, stating that an obtuse angle is smaller than an acute angle, or vice versa.
4. When solving problems involving angle sums: A student may incorrectly calculate the sum of angles in a shape, leading to incorrect conclusions about the types of angles present."
1072,Multiplies by the index,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of indices (exponents) and incorrectly multiply the base by the index instead of raising the base to the power of the index. This means they treat the index as a coefficient rather than an exponent. For example, when given the expression 2^3, students with this misconception may calculate it as 2 * 3 = 6, instead of correctly calculating it as 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Simplifying expressions with indices, e.g., 3^2, where students may calculate it as 3 * 2 = 6 instead of 3 * 3 = 9.
- Solving equations with indices, e.g., 2^x = 8, where students may incorrectly solve for x by dividing 8 by 2 instead of finding the correct value of x.
- Evaluating numerical expressions involving indices, e.g., 4^2 * 2^3, where students may incorrectly multiply the bases by the indices instead of correctly applying the exponent rules."
1073,Believes if you add the same value to all numbers in the dataset the range will change,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that the range of a dataset is the difference between the highest and lowest values. They may think that adding the same value to all numbers in the dataset will change the range, possibly because they believe the increase in the actual values will affect the spread of the data.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When a student is asked to find the new range after adding a constant value to all the data points in a dataset. For example, if the original dataset is {2, 5, 8, 11} and 3 is added to each number, the student may think the range will change.
- Case 2: When a student is given a real-life scenario, such as the prices of items increasing by a fixed amount, and they need to determine the new range of prices.
- Case 3: When a student is working with a word problem that involves temperature changes, and they need to find the new range of temperatures after a uniform increase or decrease."
1074,Multiplies rather than divides,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they need to multiply instead of divide in a mathematical problem. This can happen when students are faced with problems that involve scaling, equivalent ratios, or proportions. Students may incorrectly assume that multiplying will provide the correct solution, rather than recognizing that division is the correct operation to use.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A recipe calls for 4 cups of flour to make 8 cookies. If a student wants to make 4 cookies, they may multiply 4 cups by 1/2 instead of dividing 4 cups by 2 to find the correct amount of flour needed.
2. A bookshelf has 12 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If a student wants to know how many books can fit on 3 shelves, they may multiply 12 shelves by 3 instead of dividing the total number of books (12 x 8) by 4 to find the correct answer.
3. A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. If a student wants to know how many miles the car travels per hour, they may multiply 240 miles by 4 instead of dividing 240 miles by 4 to find the correct answer."
1075,When asked to add fractions uses the method for multiplying fractions instead.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to add fractions, but they mistakenly apply the method used for multiplying fractions. In multiplying fractions, students multiply the numerators together to get the new numerator and multiply the denominators together to get the new denominator. However, when adding fractions, students need to follow a different procedure, which involves finding a common denominator. 

The misconception likely stems from the fact that both operations involve some form of combining the numerators and denominators, but students may not fully understand the distinct processes involved. As a result, they may incorrectly assume that adding fractions is similar to multiplying them, leading to incorrect solutions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When given two fractions with different denominators to add, such as 1/4 + 1/6, a student with this misconception might multiply the numerators (1 * 1 = 1) and denominators (4 * 6 = 24), resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/24.

2. When asked to add fractions with the same denominator, such as 1/4 + 2/4, a student might still apply the multiplication method, multiplying the numerators (1 * 2 = 2) and denominators (4 * 4 = 16), resulting in an incorrect answer of 2/16.

3. In word problems involving the addition of fractions, such as ""Tom has 1/4 of a pizza, and his friend gives him 1/6 of a pizza. How much pizza does Tom have now?"", a student with this misconception might again incorrectly apply the multiplication method to add the fractions."
1076,Cancels digits when dividing,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that when dividing numbers, they can simply cancel out digits that appear in both the dividend and divisor, without considering the actual place value of the digits or following the correct procedure for division. For example, when dividing 12 by 3, a student might incorrectly cancel out the '1' and '3', thinking that they can simplify the division problem by eliminating common digits.

This misconception can arise from a misunderstanding of the concept of cancelling common factors in fractions or a lack of understanding of the place value system.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Dividing 24 by 4: A student might cancel out the '4' in the dividend and divisor, thinking the answer is simply 2, without performing the actual division.
- Dividing 100 by 10: A student might cancel out the '0's, thinking the answer is 1, without understanding that the place value of the digits is important.
- Dividing 63 by 3: A student might cancel out the '3' in the dividend and divisor, thinking the answer is 6, without considering the tens place value of the '6'."
1077,Believes all multiples of odd numbers are odd,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the property of odd numbers. They may have learned that odd numbers multiplied by odd numbers result in odd numbers (e.g., 3 × 3 = 9, 5 × 5 = 25). However, they incorrectly extend this rule to all multiples of odd numbers, assuming that any number multiplied by an odd number will always result in an odd number. They may fail to consider the case where an odd number is multiplied by an even number.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When asked to determine the parity (odd or even) of a product involving an odd number, such as 3 × 4 or 5 × 6.
* When identifying patterns in number sequences, such as listing the multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, ...) and assuming all of them are odd.
* When solving simple multiplication problems, like 7 × 2, and expecting the result to be an odd number."
1078,"Ignores numbers written as words in worded questions, and just calculates using those written in digits","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with word problems that include numerical values written in both digits and words. Instead of considering all the given information, they tend to focus only on the numbers written in digits and disregard the numbers written in words. This can lead to incorrect calculations and ultimately, incorrect answers.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A question states: ""Tom has 5 boxes of pencils. Each box contains five hundred pencils. How many pencils does Tom have in total?"" The student might ignore the word ""five hundred"" and only use the digit ""5"" in their calculation.
- A problem asks: ""A book costs £8. If Sara has eight pounds in her wallet and her friend gives her five more, how much money does Sara have now to buy the book?"" The student might disregard the word ""eight"" and only consider the digit ""5"" in their calculation.
- A question states: ""A bakery sells 4 cakes per day. If they sell four hundred and fifty cakes in a month, how many days did they sell cakes?"" The student might ignore the words ""four hundred and fifty"" and only use the digit ""4"" in their calculation."
1079,Believes factors add to give a number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the factors of a number are the numbers that add up to that number, rather than the numbers that multiply together to give that number. For example, they might think that the factors of 6 are 2 and 4 because 2 + 4 = 6, rather than recognizing that the factors of 6 are actually 1, 2, 3, and 6 because these numbers can be multiplied together in pairs to give 6 (e.g., 1 x 6, 2 x 3).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When students are asked to list the factors of a number, they may provide numbers that add up to the given number instead of numbers that multiply together to give the number.
* When solving problems that involve finding the factors of a number, students may incorrectly use addition instead of multiplication to identify the factors.
* When working with multiplication and division problems, students may confuse the concepts of addition and multiplication, leading them to believe that factors add up to a number instead of multiplying together to give that number.

For instance:

* Case 1: A student is asked to find the factors of 8. They respond with 3 and 5 because 3 + 5 = 8, instead of recognizing the correct factors as 1, 2, 4, and 8.
* Case 2: A student is given the equation 2 x 3 = ? and responds with 5 because they believe the factors 2 and 3 add up to 5, instead of recognizing that 2 and 3 multiply together to give 6."
1080,Believes there are 20 minutes in an hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of time and its units. They may be familiar with the fact that there are 20 groups of 3 minutes in an hour in some contexts (e.g., a 3-minute song is played 20 times in an hour) or they may be simply incorrectly dividing the hour into smaller units. They might not fully grasp the idea that an hour consists of 60 minutes, which is a fundamental concept in time measurement.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the duration of an event, they may provide answers in 20-minute blocks.
- When students are required to convert time from hours to minutes, they may consistently multiply the hours by 20 instead of 60.
- When students are asked to create schedules or timetables, they may divide the hour into 20-minute intervals instead of 60 minutes.
- When students are solving word problems involving time, they may assume that there are 20 minutes in an hour, leading to incorrect calculations and answers."
1081,"When subtracting fractions, divides the numerators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to fraction subtraction and they incorrectly generalize the process. They mistakenly believe that to subtract fractions, they need to divide the numerators (the numbers on top) instead of finding a common denominator and subtracting the numerators while keeping the denominator the same. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of equivalent ratios or a lack of understanding of the importance of common denominators in fraction operations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Subtracting simple fractions: 1/2 - 1/4 (student may divide 1 by 1 instead of finding a common denominator)
* Subtracting fractions with different denominators: 3/4 - 2/5 (student may divide 3 by 2 instead of finding a common denominator)
* Word problems involving fraction subtraction: ""Tom has 3/4 of a pizza and he gives 1/6 to his friend. How much pizza does Tom have left?"" (student may incorrectly divide the numerators to solve the problem)"
1082,"When multiplying with negative numbers, assumes any negative sign can be ignored","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to multiplication with negative numbers. They may struggle to understand the concept of negative numbers and how they interact with multiplication. As a result, they might assume that the negative sign can be ignored, treating the multiplication as if it were between two positive numbers. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when dealing with real-world applications or more complex mathematical problems.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying two negative numbers, e.g., (-3) × (-4), where students might ignore the negative signs and give an answer of 3 × 4 = 12, instead of the correct answer, which is also 12, but for the right reason (i.e., the product of two negative numbers is positive).
- Multiplying a negative number by a positive number, e.g., (-3) × 4, where students might disregard the negative sign and give an answer of 3 × 4 = 12, instead of the correct answer, which is -12.
- Solving algebraic expressions involving negative numbers, such as -2x, where students might ignore the negative sign and incorrectly solve for x.
- Working with real-world problems that involve negative temperatures, debts, or other quantities, where ignoring the negative sign can lead to incorrect conclusions or decisions."
1083,Does not know the meaning of uniform cross section,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to comprehend the concept of a uniform cross-section in 3D shapes, specifically in geometry. They may struggle to identify or understand that a uniform cross-section means that the shape remains the same when cut at any point perpendicular to its length. This could be due to a lack of visualization skills or inadequate exposure to real-life examples of such shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify or describe the characteristics of 3D shapes like prisms or cylinders, students may fail to recognize the uniformity of their cross-sections.
- In problems requiring the calculation of the volume or surface area of 3D shapes, students may not consider the uniform cross-section, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When comparing different 3D shapes, students might not recognize the uniform cross-section as a key distinguishing feature between shapes.
- In real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, students may struggle to understand how uniform cross-sections are used in design and construction."
1084,Has removed brackets but not performed the operation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with mathematical expressions that involve brackets (or parentheses) and operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. The student correctly identifies that the brackets need to be removed but incorrectly assumes that simply removing the brackets is enough, without carrying out the operation that was enclosed within the brackets.

For example, in the expression 3 × (2 + 4), a student with this misconception may write 3 × 2 + 4, removing the brackets but failing to evaluate the expression inside the brackets first.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Evaluating expressions such as 2 × (5 - 1), where the student may write 2 × 5 - 1 instead of first calculating the expression inside the brackets.
- Simplifying algebraic expressions like 2(x + 3), where the student may write 2x + 3 without distributing the 2 to both terms inside the brackets.
- Working with mathematical formulas, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle, A = l × (w + h), where the student may incorrectly remove the brackets without evaluating the expression inside."
1085,Multiplied the powers rather than added them,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with exponents and are required to simplify expressions that involve multiplying two or more terms with exponents. Instead of adding the exponents as per the laws of exponents, students mistakenly multiply them, leading to incorrect results.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions like (2^3) × (2^4), students may write 2^(3 × 4) = 2^12 instead of 2^(3 + 4) = 2^7.
- When simplifying expressions like (x^2) × (x^5), students may write x^(2 × 5) = x^10 instead of x^(2 + 5) = x^7.
- When simplifying expressions like (3^2) × (3^6), students may write 3^(2 × 6) = 3^12 instead of 3^(2 + 6) = 3^8."
1086,Thinks the perimeter of a sector is the same as arc length ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definitions of perimeter of a sector and arc length. They may believe that the perimeter of a sector only refers to the curved part of the sector, which is actually the definition of arc length. As a result, they may ignore the two straight sides (radii) that make up the sector, and only consider the length of the curved part when calculating the perimeter.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to find the perimeter of a sector with a given radius and angle, students may only calculate the arc length using the formula (angle/360) × 2πr, without adding the two radii.
- When comparing the perimeters of two sectors with the same arc length but different radii, students may incorrectly conclude that the perimeters are equal.
- When solving problems involving the perimeter of a sector in real-world contexts, such as finding the perimeter of a circular garden bed or a pizza slice, students may overlook the radii and only consider the arc length."
1087,Thinks the interior angles of a polygon add up to 100n,"Explanation: This misconception suggests that students mistakenly believe the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be calculated by multiplying the number of sides (n) by 100. This incorrect formula would lead to students miscalculating the sum of interior angles for polygons with different numbers of sides.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to find the sum of interior angles of a hexagon (6-sided polygon) and responds with an answer of 600 degrees (6 x 100).
- Case 2: A student is given an octagon (8-sided polygon) and claims the sum of its interior angles is 800 degrees (8 x 100).
- Case 3: A student is asked to find the sum of interior angles of a triangle and responds with an answer of 300 degrees (3 x 100)."
1088,Believes you add the denominators when finding a fraction of another fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a fraction of another fraction. For example, if asked to find 1/2 of 3/4, some students mistakenly believe that they should add the denominators (2 and 4) together, resulting in an incorrect solution. This misunderstanding may stem from a lack of understanding of fraction multiplication or an overextension of the concept of adding fractions with like denominators.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Finding 1/3 of 2/5, where students may add 3 and 5 to get 8 as the new denominator.
- Calculating 3/4 of 2/3, where students may add 4 and 3 to get 7 as the new denominator.
- Determining 2/5 of 1/2, where students may add 5 and 2 to get 7 as the new denominator."
1089,Cannot identify mutually exclusive events,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to recognize situations where two or more events cannot happen simultaneously, known as mutually exclusive events. In probability, mutually exclusive events are those that have no common outcomes, meaning that if one event happens, the other cannot. Students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate probabilities by failing to account for the fact that some events are mutually exclusive.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the probability of rolling a 3 or a 6 on a single six-sided die, a student may add the probabilities of rolling a 3 and rolling a 6, without realizing that these events are mutually exclusive (i.e., a single roll can't result in both a 3 and a 6).
- In a scenario where a student is asked to find the probability of drawing a heart or a diamond from a standard deck of cards, they may incorrectly assume that these events can happen together and add their probabilities, rather than recognizing that drawing a heart means not drawing a diamond, and vice versa.
- When asked to calculate the probability of a coin landing on either heads or tails, a student may mistakenly add the probabilities of each outcome, not understanding that the coin can only land on one side at a time, making the events mutually exclusive."
1090,Doesn't recognise commutativity of addition with negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that the commutative property of addition, which states that the order of the numbers being added does not change the result, also applies to negative numbers. Students may believe that the order of the numbers matters when adding negative numbers, and that a + (-b) is not equal to -b + a.

For example, students with this misconception may struggle with the following cases:

- Case 1: Evaluating the expression 3 + (-5) and thinking it's different from -5 + 3.
- Case 2: Simplifying the expression -2 + 7 and thinking the result would be different if it were written as 7 + (-2).
- Case 3: Solving a problem that involves adding a negative number to a positive number, such as 4 + (-9), and thinking that the order of the numbers affects the result.
- Case 4: Comparing expressions like 2 + (-3) and -3 + 2, and not recognizing that they have the same value."
1091,Confuses a variable with a formula,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a variable, which represents a single value or a range of values, and a formula or expression, which is a mathematical operation or set of operations performed on one or more variables. Students may mistakenly treat a variable as if it were an expression that can be manipulated algebraically, or they may attempt to use a formula as if it were a single value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When simplifying expressions, students may try to ""solve"" a variable, rather than just simplifying the expression. For example, when given the expression 2x, a student may try to solve for x, rather than recognizing that the expression is already simplified.

2. When solving equations, students may confuse the variable with a numerical value, leading to incorrect solutions. For example, in the equation x + 3 = 5, a student may think that x is equal to the expression ""5 - 3"" rather than recognizing that x is a variable that represents a single value.

3. When graphing functions, students may treat the function as a variable, rather than recognizing that it is an expression that describes a relationship between variables. For example, when graphing the function y = 2x, a student may try to plot the function as if it were a single point, rather than recognizing that it is a line that describes a relationship between x and y.

4. When working with formulas, students may substitute values into a variable and then try to manipulate the formula as if it were an expression. For example, when given the formula A = πr^2 and asked to find the area of a circle with radius 4, a student may substitute 4 for r and then try to simplify the formula, rather than recognizing that the formula is a fixed expression that describes a relationship between variables."
1092,Cannot spot a coefficient within a written scenario,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to identify a coefficient in a written scenario, particularly when it is not explicitly stated as a numerical value. Coefficients are often numbers that multiply variables in an algebraic expression, but in real-world scenarios, they may be described in words. Students with this misconception may have difficulty recognizing the coefficient if it is expressed as a ratio, a proportion, or embedded within a word problem. They may also struggle to distinguish between the coefficient and other numerical values present in the scenario.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A bookshelf has 3 groups of boxes, with each group containing an equal number of boxes (x). If the total number of boxes is 15, students may not recognize that 3 is the coefficient of x.
- A recipe requires 2 times the amount of sugar as the amount of flour (x) needed. Students may not identify 2 as the coefficient of x.
- A bicycle travels 4 times faster than a person walking at a speed of x miles per hour. Students may not recognize 4 as the coefficient of x.
- A company produces 5 batches of a product, with each batch containing x units. If the total production is 25 units, students may not realize that 5 is the coefficient of x."
1093,Has multiplied the value of the first term by the the term being asked,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a specific term in an arithmetic sequence. They mistakenly believe that to find the value of a particular term, they need to multiply the first term by the term number they are looking for. For example, if the first term is 3 and they are asked to find the 5th term, they might multiply 3 by 5, resulting in an incorrect answer of 15.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Finding the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 2: Student might calculate 2 x 10 = 20.
- Calculating the 8th term of a sequence with a first term of 5: Student might calculate 5 x 8 = 40.
- Determining the 12th term of a sequence with a first term of 4: Student might calculate 4 x 12 = 48."
1094,Believes when frequencies multiply by a scale factor in a table the mean also multiplies by that scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that when the frequencies in a table are multiplied by a certain scale factor, the mean of the data set will also be multiplied by the same scale factor. This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of how the mean is calculated and how changes to the frequencies affect the mean.

For example, consider the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is given a table showing the number of hours spent watching TV per week, with frequencies of 5, 10, and 15 for 2, 4, and 6 hours respectively. If the frequencies are multiplied by 2, the student might assume that the mean number of hours spent watching TV per week will also double.
- Case 2: A student is analyzing a table of exam scores, with frequencies of 10, 20, and 30 for scores of 50, 60, and 70 respectively. If the frequencies are multiplied by 3, the student might believe that the mean score will also triple.
- Case 3: A student is working with a table showing the number of books read per month, with frequencies of 2, 4, and 6 for 1, 2, and 3 books respectively. If the frequencies are multiplied by 4, the student might assume that the mean number of books read per month will also quadruple.

In each of these cases, the student is mistakenly applying the scale factor to the mean, rather than recalculating the mean based on the new frequencies."
1095,Believes that vectors of different magnitudes can be equal.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that vector equality is determined not only by the direction but also by the magnitude. They may believe that as long as two vectors have the same direction, they are equal, regardless of their lengths or magnitudes. This misconception can be attributed to an incomplete understanding of vector properties, particularly the distinction between vector equality and parallel vectors.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When comparing two vectors in a diagram, a student might say that two vectors pointing in the same direction are equal, even if one is longer than the other.
2. In a problem involving vector addition, a student might incorrectly assume that two vectors with the same direction can be combined by simply adding their magnitudes without considering their actual lengths.
3. When determining if two vectors are equal, a student might only check if they have the same direction, neglecting to verify if their magnitudes are also the same."
1096,Thinks there are 10cl in a millilitre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 10 centilitres (cl) in 1 millilitre (mL), rather than understanding that 1 centilitre is equal to 10 millilitres. This error can stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between different units of measurement, particularly in the metric system.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting between units of measurement in a recipe, such as changing millilitres to centilitres.
- When measuring liquids in a science experiment and incorrectly labelling or converting units.
- When solving problems involving capacity, such as calculating the total volume of liquid in a container.
- When comparing the volumes of different liquids, such as comparing the volume of juice in a 1L bottle to the volume of water in a 100cl bottle."
1097,Is not able to identify a situation where Pythagoras' Theorem is needed,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to recognize scenarios where Pythagoras' Theorem can be applied to solve problems. Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. However, some students may have difficulty identifying situations where the theorem is necessary, often due to a lack of understanding of the theorem's relevance or its connection to real-world problems.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Students may attempt to use other mathematical formulas or methods to solve problems that involve right-angled triangles, rather than recognizing the opportunity to apply Pythagoras' Theorem.
* When faced with a problem that requires the use of Pythagoras' Theorem, students may become stuck or uncertain about how to proceed, failing to recognize the theorem's relevance to the situation.
* Students may struggle to distinguish between situations where Pythagoras' Theorem is applicable and those where it is not, leading to incorrect or incomplete solutions.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A student is asked to find the length of a ladder leaning against a wall, given the height of the wall and the distance from the base of the ladder to the wall. The student fails to recognize that Pythagoras' Theorem can be used to solve this problem.
* Case 2: A student is given a problem involving a right-angled triangle with two known side lengths and is asked to find the length of the third side. However, the student attempts to use a different mathematical formula, such as the formula for the area of a triangle, rather than Pythagoras' Theorem.
* Case 3: A student is presented with a real-world scenario, such as designing a building or a bridge, that requires the use of Pythagoras' Theorem to calculate distances or heights. However, the student fails to recognize the opportunity to apply the theorem, leading to an incomplete or inaccurate solution."
1098,Finds the mean instead of the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the range of a set of numbers, but instead, they calculate the mean. The mean is the average of a set of numbers, whereas the range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the set. Students may get confused between these two concepts and apply the formula for the mean, which involves adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total count, instead of simply subtracting the smallest value from the largest value to find the range.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are given a set of exam scores and asked to find the range of scores, but they calculate the mean score instead.
* When students are analyzing data on the heights of their classmates and are asked to find the range of heights, but they calculate the average height instead.
* When students are working with a set of temperatures recorded over a week and are asked to find the range of temperatures, but they calculate the mean temperature instead.
* When students are given a set of scores in a game and are asked to find the range of scores, but they calculate the average score instead."
1099,Believes gradient at a point = y coordinate/x coordinate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient, specifically at a point on a curve or a line. They incorrectly assume that the gradient at a point can be found by simply dividing the y-coordinate of the point by its x-coordinate. This misconception ignores the fact that the gradient is a measure of the rate of change of the function at that point, which involves the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When finding the gradient at a point on a linear graph, students may simply divide the y-coordinate by the x-coordinate, ignoring the actual slope of the line.
* When dealing with non-linear graphs, such as quadratic or cubic functions, students may again divide the y-coordinate by the x-coordinate, without considering the tangent to the curve at that point.
* In real-world applications, such as calculating the gradient of a physical slope or a financial graph, students may apply this misconception, leading to incorrect results."
1100,Believes direct proportion means a 1:1 ratio,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of direct proportion, thinking that it always represents a 1:1 ratio. In other words, they believe that for every unit increase in one variable, the other variable will also increase by exactly one unit. This is not necessarily the case, as direct proportion only means that the two variables change at a constant rate, not necessarily at a 1:1 ratio.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the cost of items in different quantities, students may assume that if 1 item costs $2, then 2 items will cost $4, which is correct, but they may also think that this is the only possible direct proportion (1:1).
- In a recipe, if 2 cups of flour are needed to make 4 cookies, students may think that to make 6 cookies, they will need 3 cups of flour (maintaining a 1:1 ratio), without considering the actual proportion.
- When analyzing the relationship between distance and time, students might assume that if it takes 1 hour to travel 10 miles, it will take 2 hours to travel 20 miles, which might not be the case if the speed is not constant.
- In a graph showing a direct proportion, students may expect the line to have a slope of 1, representing a 1:1 ratio, and be confused if the slope is different."
1101,Believes stratified samples should be evenly split,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a stratified sample must have an equal number of participants from each subgroup or stratum. They may think that if they are sampling from different subgroups within a population (e.g., by age, location, or other characteristics), each subgroup should contribute the same number of participants to the sample, resulting in an even split.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Conducting a survey: Students may decide to survey 100 people from a population consisting of 4 age groups (18-25, 26-35, 36-45, and 46-55). They might assume that they need to sample 25 people from each age group to create a stratified sample.

2. Analyzing customer preferences: Students may want to collect data on customer preferences for a product, splitting the sample by location (urban, suburban, and rural). They may think they need to collect data from an equal number of customers (e.g., 50) from each location.

3. Studying student performance: Students might want to analyze student performance across different school types (public, private, and charter). They may believe that their sample should consist of an equal number of students from each school type.

4. Investigating environmental issues: Students may be studying the effects of pollution on different types of water sources (rivers, lakes, and oceans). They may assume that their stratified sample should have an equal number of data points from each type of water source.

5. Researching employee satisfaction: Students may want to study employee satisfaction across different departments within a company (marketing, sales, and IT). They might think they need to collect data from an equal number of employees from each department."
1102,Believes that addition should be used when finding the difference between two values on a time series graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the difference between two values on a time series graph. They mistakenly believe that they should add the values together instead of subtracting one from the other. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of ""difference"" or a misunderstanding of how to interpret the data on the graph. Students may think that by adding the values, they are finding the total or the combined value, rather than the actual difference between the two points.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the number of items sold in two different years on a time series graph, a student may add the values together, thinking that this will give them the total number of items sold.
- When analyzing the temperature readings on a time series graph, a student may add the temperatures together, instead of finding the difference between the highest and lowest temperatures.
- When looking at a time series graph of a company's profits, a student may add the profits from two different years, thinking that this will give them the total profit, instead of finding the difference in profits between the two years."
1103,"When reading integers on a number line, assumes each dash is 2","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the intervals or dashes marked on a number line represent a unit of 2, rather than the conventional unit of 1. As a result, they incorrectly interpret the spacing between numbers on the number line. For instance, if a number line has marks at 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, a student with this misconception would think that the first dash after 0 represents 2, the next dash represents 4, and so on.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When counting forward or backward by 1 on a number line, a student may jump two numbers instead of one.
- When locating a specific number on a number line, a student may place it at an incorrect position, two units away from its actual position.
- When determining the difference between two numbers on a number line, a student may calculate the distance as being twice the actual difference.
- When comparing the relative positions of numbers on a number line, a student may conclude that a number is twice as far away from a reference point as it actually is."
1104,Simplifies integers when simplifying a mixed number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the rules for simplifying fractions to the integer part of a mixed number. They may incorrectly divide or reduce the integer part along with the fractional part, resulting in an incorrect simplified form of the mixed number. 

For example, when simplifying the mixed number 3 6/8, students with this misconception might simplify the integer part (3) and the fraction (6/8) separately and incorrectly, rather than just simplifying the fraction. They might think that since 6 and 8 can be divided by 2, the integer 3 should also be divided, which would result in an incorrect answer.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying mixed numbers with fractions that have common factors.
Example: 2 4/6 (students might simplify the integer 2 and the fraction 4/6 incorrectly).
2. Converting improper fractions to mixed numbers and then simplifying.
Example: 10/4 = 2 2/4 (students might simplify the integer 2 and the fraction 2/4 incorrectly).
3. Adding or subtracting mixed numbers and then simplifying the result.
Example: 2 1/4 + 1 1/4 = 3 2/4 (students might simplify the integer 3 and the fraction 2/4 incorrectly)."
1105,Rounds every number to the same degree instead of rounding to significant figures when estimating ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to estimate quantities or measurements and they round every number to the same degree, usually to the nearest whole number or to one decimal place, without considering the concept of significant figures. They may think that rounding is solely about making numbers simpler, rather than understanding that significant figures convey the precision of a measurement. 

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When estimating the sum of 12.5 kg and 8.97 kg, a student may round both numbers to the nearest whole number (12 kg and 9 kg), rather than considering the number of significant figures in each measurement.
- When calculating the area of a rectangle with a length of 4.23 m and a width of 2.1 m, a student may round both measurements to one decimal place (4.2 m and 2.1 m), without considering the number of significant figures in each measurement.
- When solving a problem involving the multiplication of 5.67 and 2.456, a student may round both numbers to the nearest whole number or to one decimal place, rather than applying the rules of significant figures to determine the appropriate degree of rounding."
1106,Divides 360 degrees by sum of sides rather than given amount of angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the measure of each interior angle of a polygon, they need to divide 360 degrees by the total number of sides rather than the total number of angles. They fail to recognize that the number of angles in a polygon is equal to the number of sides, and it's the number of angles that is used in the calculation, not the sum of the sides. 

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations, especially when dealing with polygons that have more or fewer sides than they are used to.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to find the measure of each interior angle of a hexagon (6 sides) and they divide 360 degrees by 12 (the sum of the sides, 1+2+3+4+5+6) instead of dividing by 6 (the number of angles).
- A student is asked to find the measure of each interior angle of a triangle (3 sides) and they divide 360 degrees by 6 (the sum of the sides, 1+2+3) instead of dividing by 3 (the number of angles).
- A student is asked to find the measure of each interior angle of a pentagon (5 sides) and they divide 360 degrees by 15 (the sum of the sides, 1+2+3+4+5) instead of dividing by 5 (the number of angles)."
1107,Converted hours to minutes instead of hours to seconds,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are required to convert time from hours to another unit, but they incorrectly assume that the conversion should be to minutes instead of seconds. This can happen when students are not fully understanding the context of the problem or are not paying attention to the units required. For example, if a question asks for the time it takes for an object to travel a certain distance in seconds, and the time is given in hours, students with this misconception may incorrectly convert the hours to minutes instead of seconds.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A car travels 60 miles in 1 hour. How many seconds does it take for the car to travel 1 mile?
- A water tank can be filled in 2 hours. How many seconds will it take to fill half the tank?
- A person runs 10 kilometers in 1 hour. What is their speed in meters per second?
- A bicycle travels 20 miles in 2 hours. How many seconds does it take for the bicycle to travel 1 mile?"
1108,"Believes  c, in y=mx+c, will be the y value of the coordinate given despite the x coordinate not being 0.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the role of the constant term 'c' in the linear equation y = mx + c. They incorrectly believe that 'c' represents the y-coordinate of any given point on the line, regardless of the x-coordinate. In reality, 'c' specifically represents the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, i.e., when x = 0.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are given a linear equation and a point on the line (e.g., y = 2x + 3 and the point (2, 7)), they may assume that 'c' (which is 3 in this case) is the y-coordinate of the given point (7), without realizing that 'c' only represents the y-coordinate when x = 0.
* When graphing a linear equation, students may incorrectly plot the y-intercept at a point on the line where x is not equal to 0, rather than at the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
* When solving problems involving linear equations, students may substitute the y-coordinate of a given point into the equation as 'c', without considering the x-coordinate, leading to incorrect solutions."
1109,"On a cumulative frequency diagram, believes the total frequency is the top of the frequency axis rather than the top of the curve","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misinterpret the information presented in a cumulative frequency diagram. They mistakenly believe that the total frequency is represented by the highest point on the frequency axis, rather than understanding that the total frequency is actually represented by the highest point on the cumulative frequency curve. This means they are looking at the scale on the axis rather than the actual data being represented by the curve.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the total number of observations in a dataset from a cumulative frequency diagram, students may simply look at the highest value on the frequency axis, rather than tracing the curve to its highest point.
- When comparing two or more cumulative frequency diagrams, students may incorrectly conclude that the diagram with the highest frequency axis value has the most observations, rather than comparing the highest points on the curves.
- When calculating the median or other percentiles from a cumulative frequency diagram, students may incorrectly use the highest value on the frequency axis, leading to incorrect calculations."
1110,Does not think that -n + n = 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the concept of additive inverses. They may think that when you add a negative number to its positive counterpart, it doesn't cancel out or result in zero. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the number line or the concept of opposites. Students may believe that -n and +n are separate entities that don't have a direct relationship, rather than recognizing that they are opposites that, when combined, neutralize each other.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as -3x + 3x, students may not realize that the terms cancel each other out.
- When solving equations, like -2 + 2 = ?, students may not understand that the correct answer is 0.
- When working with word problems, such as ""Tom has -5 apples and his friend gives him 5 apples,"" students may not grasp that Tom now has 0 apples.
- When dealing with number sequences, like -1, 0, 1, -1, 0, 1, students may not recognize the pattern of additive inverses cancelling each other out.
- When solving problems with multiple steps, such as -4 + 2 + 2 = ?, students may not apply the concept of additive inverses correctly."
1111,Does not understand the term 'linear',"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term 'linear' as anything that is a straight line, without understanding the specific conditions that define a linear relationship. They may assume any relationship that can be graphed as a straight line is linear, failing to consider the key characteristics of linearity, such as a constant rate of change and a direct proportional relationship between variables.

This misconception can occur in various contexts, including:

* When graphing data: Students may assume that any straight-line graph represents a linear relationship, even if the data does not meet the conditions of linearity.
* In algebra: Students may mistakenly identify non-linear equations as linear, simply because they can be graphed as a straight line, without checking for the necessary conditions of linearity.
* When working with real-world applications: Students may incorrectly assume that a linear relationship exists between variables, simply because they can plot the data as a straight line, without considering other factors that may affect the relationship.
* In geometry: Students may confuse linear with other types of relationships, such as affine or proportional relationships, and assume that any straight-line relationship is linear.
* When analyzing data: Students may misinterpret the term 'linear' and assume that any data that appears to follow a straight line represents a linear relationship, without considering other factors that may influence the data."
1112,"When using Pythagoras' theorem to find a missing side, thinks you multiply the sides together then square root","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the application of Pythagoras' theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Instead of adding the squares of the two known sides, students with this misconception believe they need to multiply the two sides together and then take the square root of the result to find the length of the missing side.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When finding the length of the hypotenuse: If the lengths of the two shorter sides are given, students may multiply these lengths together and then take the square root, rather than squaring each length, adding them together, and then taking the square root.
* When finding a shorter side: If the length of the hypotenuse and one shorter side are given, students may multiply the length of the hypotenuse by the length of the shorter side and then take the square root, rather than squaring the lengths, subtracting the square of the shorter side from the square of the hypotenuse, and then taking the square root.
* In word problems: Students may apply this misconception in real-world scenarios, such as finding the distance between two points on a coordinate grid or calculating the height of a building, leading to incorrect solutions."
1113,"When substituting a value into a non-linear term with a coefficient, multiplies by the coefficient then calculates the power.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with expressions that involve non-linear terms, such as squaring or cubing, and a coefficient. They mistakenly believe that they should first multiply the value by the coefficient, and then raise the result to the power. For example, when evaluating the expression 2x^2, students with this misconception would substitute x = 3 by first multiplying 3 by 2, resulting in 6, and then squaring 6 to get 36. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Evaluating the expression 3x^2 when x = 4: students would multiply 4 by 3 to get 12, then square 12.
- Evaluating the expression 2x^3 when x = 2: students would multiply 2 by 2 to get 4, then cube 4.
- Evaluating the expression 4x^2 when x = 5: students would multiply 5 by 4 to get 20, then square 20."
1114,Believes they can change the subject of a formula just by swapping two letters,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that algebraic formulas can be manipulated simply by swapping the positions of variables (letters), without understanding the underlying mathematical operations and relationships between the variables. They may believe that if a formula is true for a particular set of variables, it will remain true if the variables are swapped. For example, if they have a formula like ""A = B + C"", they might think that swapping A and B would result in a valid formula ""B = A + C"", without realizing that this changes the relationship between the variables.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Case 1: Swapping x and y in the formula y = 2x, resulting in x = 2y, without understanding that this changes the function and its graph.
- Case 2: Swapping the variables in a simple equation like 2A = 3B, resulting in 2B = 3A, without realizing that this changes the solution to the equation.
- Case 3: Swapping the variables in a formula for area, such as A = length × width, resulting in a formula like length = A × width, without understanding that this is not a valid formula for length."
1115,Identifies the term-to-term rule rather than the next term in a sequence,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that identifying the pattern or rule between consecutive terms in a sequence is the same as identifying the next term in the sequence. They may focus on describing the relationship between each pair of terms, but fail to apply this understanding to determine the next term in the sequence. 

For example, given the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, a student may correctly identify the term-to-term rule as ""add 3"" but when asked to find the next term, they may struggle to apply this rule to get the correct answer, which is 14. They might say the rule is ""add 3"" but not use it to find the next term.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are given a sequence and asked to find the next term, but instead, they describe the pattern between each pair of terms.
- When students are asked to generate a sequence given a starting point and a term-to-term rule, but they only write the rule and not the next terms in the sequence.
- When students are given a word problem that involves a sequence, and they identify the pattern but fail to apply it to solve the problem.
- When students are given a sequence with a more complex term-to-term rule, and they correctly identify the rule but struggle to apply it to find the next term."
1116,Multiplies coefficients and letters separately and writes as an addition,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the distributive property of multiplication over addition in algebraic expressions. They incorrectly multiply the coefficients (numbers) and variables (letters) separately and then write the results as an addition, rather than multiplying the entire expression.

For example, when multiplying 2(x + 3), students with this misconception might write:

2(x) + 2(3) as 2x + 6 (correct)

However, when faced with an expression like 2(x + 3y), they might incorrectly write:

2(x) + 2(3) + 2(y) as 2x + 6 + 2y, instead of the correct 2x + 6y.

This misconception can also occur in more complex expressions, such as:

* 3(2x + 4) being written as 3(2x) + 3(4) and incorrectly expanded as 6x + 12 + 4, instead of just 6x + 12.
* 4(x + 2y + 3) being written as 4(x) + 4(2y) + 4(3) and incorrectly expanded as 4x + 8y + 12 + 3, instead of just 4x + 8y + 12.

This misconception highlights the need for students to understand the distributive property and how to apply it correctly when multiplying algebraic expressions."
1117,"When finding a missing length on similar shapes, just find the scale factor","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with similar shapes and need to find a missing length. They mistakenly believe that simply finding the scale factor between the two shapes is enough to determine the missing length. However, they fail to apply the scale factor correctly to the corresponding lengths of the two shapes. 

This misconception indicates that the students understand the concept of scale factor but do not fully comprehend how to use it to find missing lengths in similar shapes. They may be able to identify the scale factor but do not recognize that it needs to be applied to the corresponding side lengths in order to find the missing length.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When comparing the perimeters of two similar polygons, a student may only calculate the scale factor and not use it to find the missing side length.
2. In a problem involving the heights of two similar triangles, a student may calculate the scale factor but not multiply it by the known height to find the unknown height.
3. When working with similar rectangles, a student may find the scale factor but not apply it to the length and width to find the missing dimensions of the larger or smaller rectangle."
1118,Thinks the smallest bar in a bar chart is the mode,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the mode in a dataset is represented by the smallest bar in a bar chart, rather than the bar with the highest frequency. They may incorrectly assume that the shortest bar corresponds to the most common value, when in fact the mode is the value that appears most frequently in the dataset, regardless of the length of the corresponding bar.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When analyzing a bar chart with categorical data, a student might point to the shortest bar and claim it's the mode because ""it's the smallest"".
* When comparing two bar charts, a student might say that the chart with the shorter bars has a lower mode, even if the data shows that the shorter bars actually represent lower frequencies.
* When creating their own bar charts, students might intentionally make the bar for the mode shorter than the others, mistakenly thinking that this is how to represent the most common value.
* When interpreting a bar chart with multiple bars of similar heights, a student might choose the shortest bar as the mode, simply because it stands out as being different, rather than looking at the actual frequencies."
1119,Does not interpret the correct order of operations in a fraction when there is an addition on the numerator,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with fractions that have an addition operation in the numerator. They may incorrectly evaluate the expression by adding the numbers in the numerator first and then dividing by the denominator, or they may divide each number in the numerator by the denominator separately and then add. 

For example, when given the expression 3 + 4 / 5, students with this misconception may evaluate it as (3 + 4) / 5 = 7 / 5 or 3 / 5 + 4 / 5, instead of following the correct order of operations. This misconception can be further complicated when there are multiple operations in the numerator, such as 3 + 4 - 2 / 5.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- 2 + 3 / 4
- 5 - 2 + 1 / 3
- 1 + 2 - 3 / 2
- 4 + 2 + 1 / 2"
1120,Thinks there are 100 ml in a litre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between milliliters (mL) and liters (L). They may believe that 1 liter is equal to 100 milliliters, rather than the correct conversion of 1 liter being equal to 1000 milliliters. This misconception can lead to errors in measurement and calculation, particularly when working with liquids or capacities.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading recipes or instructions that involve measuring liquids in liters or milliliters.
- When completing math problems that involve converting between units of measurement, such as converting liters to milliliters or vice versa.
- When measuring liquids in science experiments or practical activities, such as measuring the volume of a liquid in a beaker or container.
- When comparing the capacities of different containers, such as comparing the volume of a 1-liter bottle to a 100-milliliter cup."
1121,Believes biased selection methods can be random,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that a selection method is random, even if it's biased or doesn't give every item or individual an equal chance of being chosen. They may think that as long as the selection is not based on a specific pattern or order, it's random. However, they fail to recognize that the selection method itself can be flawed, leading to biased outcomes.

For example:

- Case 1: In a classroom, a student is asked to pick a few of their friends to participate in a game. The student chooses their closest friends, thinking it's a random selection because they didn't choose them in a specific order. However, this selection method is biased because it only includes the student's friends, excluding other classmates.

- Case 2: When conducting a survey, a student decides to only ask people of the same age group or with similar interests, thinking it's a random sample because they're not choosing specific individuals. However, this selection method is biased because it doesn't represent the diverse perspectives of the larger population.

- Case 3: A student creates a music playlist by choosing songs from their favorite artists, thinking it's a random mix because they're not selecting songs in a specific order. However, this selection method is biased because it only includes songs from their preferred artists, excluding other genres or artists.

In each of these cases, the students mistakenly believe that their selection methods are random, when in fact, they're biased and may lead to inaccurate or unfair outcomes."
1122,"When enlarging a shape, thinks the scale factor divides the movement from the centre of enlargement to a vertex rather than multiplies","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of scale factor in enlarging a shape. They mistakenly believe that to find the new position of a vertex after enlargement, they need to divide the distance from the centre of enlargement to the original vertex by the scale factor, rather than multiplying it. This would result in the students incorrectly calculating the new coordinates or positions of the vertices of the enlarged shape.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a student is asked to enlarge a shape by a scale factor of 2, they may think that the distance from the centre of enlargement to the new vertex is half of the original distance, rather than double.
- If a student is given a shape with a vertex 6 units away from the centre of enlargement and is asked to enlarge it by a scale factor of 3, they may calculate the new distance as 6 ÷ 3 = 2 units, instead of 6 × 3 = 18 units.
- When working with negative scale factors, students with this misconception may incorrectly divide the distance by the absolute value of the scale factor, rather than multiplying by the negative scale factor to obtain the correct new position of the vertex."
1123,Subtracts rather than dividing to find unit price,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the unit price of an item, but instead of dividing the total cost by the number of units, they subtract the number of units from the total cost. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of unit price and the operation required to calculate it. Students may think that subtracting the number of units will give them the cost per unit, rather than realizing that division is necessary to find the cost per unit.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A packet of 5 pens costs $10. How much does one pen cost? (Student subtracts 5 from 10 instead of dividing 10 by 5)
* A 2 kg bag of apples costs $8. How much does 1 kg of apples cost? (Student subtracts 2 from 8 instead of dividing 8 by 2)
* A box of 12 crayons costs $6. How much does one crayon cost? (Student subtracts 12 from 6 instead of dividing 6 by 12)"
1124,When ordering numbers in standard form just looks at the decimal without multiplying by a power of 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are comparing numbers in standard form (also known as scientific notation), but instead of considering the exponent (power of 10), they only focus on the decimal part of the number. They might think that a larger decimal value automatically means the number is larger, ignoring the fact that the power of 10 can greatly affect the actual value of the number.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Comparing 4.5 x 10^2 and 5.2 x 10^1, a student might think 5.2 x 10^1 is larger because 5.2 is greater than 4.5, without realizing that the power of 10 in the first number makes it significantly larger.
- Ordering the numbers 3.8 x 10^3, 4.2 x 10^2, and 5.1 x 10^1 from smallest to largest. A student with this misconception might list them as 3.8 x 10^3, 4.2 x 10^2, 5.1 x 10^1, instead of considering the powers of 10.
- Deciding which number is larger between 2.5 x 10^4 and 3.1 x 10^3, a student might incorrectly choose 3.1 x 10^3 because 3.1 is greater than 2.5, without taking into account the difference in powers of 10."
1125,Multiplies rather than adds when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply multiplication instead of addition to solve word problems that involve combining or adding quantities. This error often stems from a misunderstanding of the mathematical operations and their application in real-world contexts. Students might misinterpret certain keywords or phrases in the problem, leading them to believe that multiplication is the correct operation, even when the situation calls for addition.

Examples of cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Tom has 5 pencils in his pencil case, and his friend gives him 3 more pencils. If a student multiplies instead of adds, they might calculate 5 x 3 = 15 pencils, instead of the correct answer of 5 + 3 = 8 pencils.
2. A bookshelf has 4 shelves, and each shelf can hold 5 books. If the bookshelf already has 8 books on it, and 2 more books are added, a student might multiply 4 x 5 to find the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, and then incorrectly add the new books, instead of simply adding 8 + 2 to find the total number of books on the bookshelf.
3. A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. If they sell bread for 5 days, and then receive a new shipment of 100 loaves, a student might multiply 250 x 5 to calculate the total loaves sold, and then incorrectly multiply or add the new shipment, instead of adding 250 x 5 + 100 to find the total number of loaves."
1126,Believes the mean is always representative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the mean of a dataset is always a representative or ""typical"" value, regardless of the data distribution. They may assume that the mean is a reliable indicator of the data's central tendency, without considering the presence of outliers, skewness, or other factors that can affect the mean's representativeness.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with datasets containing extreme outliers, where the mean is significantly influenced by these outliers, making it unrepresentative of the majority of the data.
- When working with skewed distributions, where the mean is pulled towards the tail of the distribution, making it less representative of the typical values.
- When analyzing data with multiple modes or clusters, where the mean may not accurately reflect the characteristics of the different groups.
- When comparing datasets with different levels of variability, where the mean may not capture the differences in spread or dispersion.
- When making decisions based on the mean without considering other measures of central tendency, such as the median or mode, which may provide a more accurate representation of the data."
1127,Believes the variable should remain in place after substituting its value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to fully grasp the concept of substitution in algebraic expressions. They may believe that the variable should remain in the equation even after its value has been substituted, often resulting in expressions that contain both the variable and its numerical value. This misconception can lead to incorrect simplification and evaluation of expressions.

Examples of cases when this misconception may occur:

- When solving linear equations, such as 2x + 3 = 7, a student may substitute x = 2 but still write the equation as 2x + 3 = 2(2) + 3, instead of 4 + 3.
- When evaluating expressions like 3x^2 - 2x + 1, and given x = 4, a student may write 3x^2 - 2x + 1 = 3(4)^2 - 2x + 1, instead of 3(4)^2 - 2(4) + 1.
- When working with formulas, such as the area of a rectangle (A = length × width), and given length = 5 and width = 3, a student may write A = 5 × width, instead of A = 5 × 3."
1128,Does not know how to interpret a fraction worded problem ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend word problems involving fractions, often due to difficulties in translating the problem's language into a mathematical representation. They may have trouble identifying the numerator, denominator, or the operation required to solve the problem. This misconception can lead to incorrect solutions or an inability to even start solving the problem.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: ""Tom has 3/4 of a pizza left. If he gives 1/4 to his friend, how much pizza does Tom have left?"" - The student may struggle to understand that the problem requires subtracting fractions.
- Case 2: ""A recipe requires 2/3 cup of sugar. If you want to make half the recipe, how much sugar do you need?"" - The student may have trouble identifying the fraction and applying the concept of equivalent ratios.
- Case 3: ""A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and 3/5 of them are filled with books. How many shelves are filled?"" - The student may have difficulty understanding that the fraction represents a part of the whole and how to calculate the number of filled shelves."
1129,"When finding a missing part in a ratio, divides rather than multiplies","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with ratios and proportions. They may mistakenly believe that to find a missing part in a ratio, they need to divide the given parts, rather than multiplying them by a common factor. For instance, if a ratio of boys to girls in a class is 3:4 and there are 12 girls, students with this misconception might divide 12 by 4 to get 3, and then divide 3 by 3 to find the multiplier, rather than simply multiplying 3 by the same factor that multiplied 4 to get 12.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: A recipe for making cookies requires a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour. If 9 cups of flour are needed, a student with this misconception might divide 9 by 3 to get 3, and then divide 2 by 2 to find the multiplier, rather than multiplying 2 by the factor that multiplied 3 to get 9.

- Case 2: A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours, and a student wants to find out how far it will travel in 3 hours, given the ratio of distance to time is 3:1. The student with this misconception might divide 240 by 4 to get 60, and then divide 60 by 3 to find the distance, rather than multiplying 3 by the factor that multiplied 1 to get 4.

- Case 3: A group of friends want to share some candy in the ratio of 2:3. If they have 18 pieces of candy, a student with this misconception might divide 18 by 3 to get 6, and then divide 2 by 2 to find the share of the first group, rather than multiplying 2 by the factor that multiplied 3 to get 18."
1130,Does not know how to solve linear equations involving fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to apply the usual methods of solving linear equations to equations that involve fractions. They may struggle to isolate the variable due to the presence of fractions, which can make the equation seem more complex. Students may not understand that the same rules of algebra apply, but they need to manipulate the equation to eliminate the fractions, often by finding a common denominator or multiplying both sides of the equation by a specific value.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When an equation has a fraction as a coefficient (e.g., 1/2x + 3 = 5)
* When an equation has a fraction as a constant term (e.g., x + 2/3 = 4)
* When an equation involves adding or subtracting fractions (e.g., 1/4x + 1/2 = 3/4)
* When an equation involves multiplying or dividing fractions (e.g., 2/3x = 3/4)
* When an equation requires cross-multiplication to solve (e.g., x/2 = 3/4)"
1131,"When adding fractions, multiplies the numerators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to adding fractions and they incorrectly generalize the process. They may understand that to add fractions, some operation needs to be performed on the numerators, but they incorrectly assume that this operation is multiplication. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions and the need to have the same denominator when adding fractions.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When adding two fractions with different denominators, students may multiply the numerators together and keep the same denominator. For example, when adding 1/4 and 1/6, they may write the answer as (1*1)/(4 or 6).
- When adding two fractions with the same denominator, students may still multiply the numerators together. For example, when adding 1/8 and 2/8, they may write the answer as (1*2)/8.
- When adding more than two fractions, students may multiply all the numerators together, leading to an incorrect result. For example, when adding 1/4, 1/6, and 1/8, they may write the answer as (1*1*1)/(4 or 6 or 8)."
1132,Does not understand that a probability of 1 represents something that is certain,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to grasp the concept of probability as a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. They may believe that a probability of 1 is simply a high chance, rather than a guarantee of the event happening. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that in everyday language, people often express probabilities as percentages or chances, rather than as a value between 0 and 1. As a result, students may not fully comprehend that a probability of 1 represents a 100% chance, with no room for alternative outcomes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When predicting the outcome of a certain event, such as ""What is the probability that a fair coin will land on heads when flipped and it is known that it has been tampered with to always land on heads?"" 
- When analyzing the probability of a specific card being drawn from a deck, if it is known that the deck only contains one type of card.
- When calculating the probability of an event in which all other possible outcomes have been eliminated."
1133,Does not recognise a quadratic graph,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify or recognize the characteristics of a quadratic graph, which is a fundamental concept in algebra. Quadratic graphs are typically U-shaped and can open upwards or downwards. Students may struggle to distinguish quadratic graphs from other types of graphs, such as linear or cubic graphs. They may also have difficulty identifying the key features of a quadratic graph, such as the vertex, axis of symmetry, and x-intercepts.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, including:

* Confusing quadratic graphs with linear graphs, especially if the quadratic graph is nearly linear in shape.
* Failing to recognize that a quadratic graph can have zero, one, or two x-intercepts.
* Not understanding that the vertex of a quadratic graph represents the maximum or minimum point of the function.
* Difficulty identifying the axis of symmetry of a quadratic graph.
* Struggling to distinguish between quadratic graphs that open upwards and those that open downwards.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A student is given a graph and asked to identify its type. The graph is a quadratic function, but the student mistakenly identifies it as a linear function.
* Case 2: A student is asked to find the x-intercepts of a quadratic graph, but they are unable to do so because they do not recognize the graph as quadratic.
* Case 3: A student is given a quadratic equation and asked to graph it. However, their graph does not resemble a typical quadratic graph, indicating that they do not understand the characteristics of quadratic graphs."
1134,"When solving an equation, adds instead of dividing","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of inverse operations in algebra. They may think that to isolate a variable, they need to perform the same operation as the one being applied to the variable, rather than the inverse operation. In the case of multiplication, the inverse operation is division, but students with this misconception will incorrectly add instead of dividing.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving simple equations like 3x = 12, the student may add 3 to 12 instead of dividing 12 by 3.
- When solving word problems that involve multiplication, such as ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils each, how many pencils does Tom have in total if he has x groups?"", the student may add 3 to the product instead of dividing the total number of pencils by 3.
- When working with fractions, the student may add the denominator to the numerator instead of dividing the numerator by the denominator to simplify the fraction.
- When solving problems involving ratios, the student may add the ratio instead of dividing to find the missing value.
- When working with multi-step equations, the student may incorrectly add instead of dividing at one or more steps, leading to an incorrect solution."
1135,"When subtracting a negative number, adds the absolute values and then writes the answer with a negative sign","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of subtracting negative numbers. They may think that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the absolute values, but then incorrectly assume that the result should be negative. For example, when subtracting -3 from 5, students with this misconception may calculate 5 + 3 = 8, but then write the answer as -8, instead of the correct answer of 8.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Subtracting a negative number from a positive number, e.g., 5 - (-3) = ?
- Subtracting a negative number from another negative number, e.g., -5 - (-3) = ?
- Solving algebraic expressions involving subtraction of negative numbers, e.g., 2x - (-3x) = ?
- Interpreting word problems that involve subtracting negative numbers, e.g., ""Tom has $5 and pays off a debt of -$3, how much money does he have now?"""
1136,"Believes that a general trend of an increase or decrease over time, on a statistical diagram, means that the slope must be in the same direction for the whole time period","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret a general trend in a statistical diagram, such as a line graph, as indicating a consistent and continuous increase or decrease over the entire time period. They may believe that if the overall trend is upward, the slope of the line must be positive for the entire duration, and if the trend is downward, the slope must be negative for the entire duration.

Students with this misconception may overlook or ignore fluctuations, anomalies, or changes in the trend over time. They may not recognize that a general trend can be composed of various segments with different slopes, including segments with zero or even opposite slopes.

This misconception can occur in various contexts, such as:

* Analyzing stock market trends: A student might see a long-term increase in a company's stock price and assume that the price has been rising consistently over the entire period, ignoring short-term fluctuations or downturns.
* Examining temperature records: A student might look at a graph of global temperatures over the past century and assume that the temperature has been rising steadily, without recognizing periods of cooling or stabilization.
* Studying population growth: A student might see a graph showing an overall increase in a country's population and assume that the population has been growing at a constant rate, without considering periods of slower or faster growth.

In each of these cases, the student is failing to recognize that a general trend can be composed of various segments with different characteristics, and that the slope of the line can change over time."
1137,"When squaring a variable with a power, thinks that the power is squared rather than doubled. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with algebraic expressions involving variables with powers. They mistakenly believe that when squaring a variable with a power, the power itself should be squared, rather than doubled. For example, if they are given the expression (x^3)^2, they may think that the result is x^(3^2), which equals x^9, rather than the correct result, x^(3*2), which equals x^6.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying expressions like (x^2)^3, where students might think the result is x^(2^3) = x^8 instead of x^(2*3) = x^6.
- When working with algebraic equations, such as (x^4)^2 = 16, where students might solve for x by using the incorrect power, x^(4^2) = x^16.
- When dealing with more complex expressions, like ((x^2)^3)^2, where students might get confused and apply the incorrect rule multiple times, resulting in an incorrect solution."
1138,Subtracts the smallest digit from the largest digit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to subtract two numbers, but instead of performing the subtraction operation correctly, they simply subtract the smallest digit from the largest digit, disregarding the place value and the actual numerical value of the numbers.

For example:

* Case 1: When subtracting 45 from 27, the student might subtract 4 (smallest digit in 45) from 7 (largest digit in 27), resulting in an incorrect answer of 3.
* Case 2: When subtracting 13 from 56, the student might subtract 1 (smallest digit in 13) from 6 (largest digit in 56), resulting in an incorrect answer of 5.
* Case 3: When subtracting 29 from 93, the student might subtract 2 (smallest digit in 29) from 9 (largest digit in 93), resulting in an incorrect answer of 7.

This misconception shows a lack of understanding of place value, numerical value, and the subtraction operation itself. It is essential to address this misconception to ensure students develop a solid foundation in mathematics."
1139,Confuses the lines y=x and y=-x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the graphs of y=x and y=-x, often leading to incorrect reflections and rotations in the coordinate plane. Students may mistakenly believe that the line y=x represents a 90-degree rotation, while y=-x represents a simple reflection over the x-axis. They might also think that y=x is the same as y=-x, but flipped over the x or y-axis.

This misconception can occur in the following short cases:

- Graphing linear equations and functions: When students are asked to graph a function such as y=-x, they might draw the graph of y=x instead, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- Understanding reflections and rotations: Students might think that reflecting a point over the line y=x will result in the same point as reflecting it over y=-x, leading to confusion when working with geometric transformations.
- Solving systems of equations: When solving a system of linear equations that involves the lines y=x and y=-x, students may incorrectly identify the point of intersection due to their misunderstanding of the lines' properties.
- Identifying symmetry: Students may incorrectly identify the line of symmetry in a graph, thinking that y=x is the line of symmetry when, in fact, it is y=-x, or vice versa."
1140,"When simplifying surds, adds the number on the outside of the surd to the number under the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with expressions involving surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be simplified into whole numbers. When simplifying surds, students may incorrectly add the number outside the surd (the coefficient) to the number under the surd (the radicand), rather than treating them separately.

For example, when simplifying the expression 3√5, students with this misconception may incorrectly simplify it to √8 (by adding 3 and 5), or when simplifying the expression 2√11, they may incorrectly simplify it to √13 (by adding 2 and 11).

This misconception can also occur when students are dealing with more complex expressions, such as √2 + 3√2, where they may incorrectly combine the terms by adding the numbers inside and outside the surds.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Simplifying the expression 2√3 to get √5
* Simplifying the expression 4√2 to get √6
* Combining the terms √5 + 2√5 to get √7 + √5
* Simplifying the expression 3√11 to get √14"
1141,Believes all grouped frequency table need a midpoint column,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a midpoint column is a necessary component of all grouped frequency tables. They may think that the midpoint is required to calculate the mean or to plot histograms, and therefore, they include it in every grouped frequency table. However, not all grouped frequency tables require a midpoint column, and students may struggle to understand when it is truly necessary.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When creating a grouped frequency table for categorical data, where midpoints are not applicable.
* When the data is not continuous, and the concept of midpoint does not apply.
* When the task only requires counting frequencies, and the midpoint is not needed for further calculations.
* When the data is already discrete, and the midpoint would not provide any additional information.
* When plotting bar charts or other types of graphs that do not require midpoints."
1142,"When converting from an improper fraction to a mixed number, adds on the part left to make the whole, rather than subtracting it","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting an improper fraction (a fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator) to a mixed number (a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction). The misconception occurs when students incorrectly add the remainder of the division of the numerator by the denominator to the whole number part, instead of recognizing that the remainder is already included in the numerator.

For example, when converting the improper fraction 7/4 to a mixed number, a student with this misconception might divide 7 by 4, getting 1 with a remainder of 3, and then add 3 to the whole number part, resulting in an incorrect answer of 4 3/4. Similarly, when converting 9/2 to a mixed number, they might divide 9 by 2, getting 4 with a remainder of 1, and then add 1 to the whole number part, resulting in an incorrect answer of 5 1/2.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Converting improper fractions to mixed numbers in simple arithmetic problems.
- Solving problems involving fractions in algebra, such as simplifying expressions or solving equations.
- Working with fractions in real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a quantity into equal parts.
- Interpreting and analyzing data presented in fractional form in statistics and data analysis."
1143,Mixes up the terms for the parts of a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the terms 'numerator' and 'denominator' in a fraction. They may think that the numerator is the number at the bottom and the denominator is the number at the top, or vice versa, but not understand the actual roles these numbers play in representing a part of a whole.

This misconception can lead to difficulties when performing operations with fractions, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing. Students may also struggle to understand concepts like equivalent fractions, comparing fractions, or converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify the numerator and denominator in a fraction, such as 3/4.
2. When comparing fractions, like determining which is larger between 1/2 and 2/3.
3. When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, such as 1/4 + 1/6.
4. When converting a mixed number to an improper fraction, like 2 3/4 to an improper fraction.
5. When simplifying fractions, such as simplifying 6/8 to its lowest terms."
1144,"Believes the equation for a horizontal line is in the form xy = a, where a is the y intercept","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the general equation for a line and its application to specific cases, such as horizontal lines. The students mistakenly believe that the product of x and y coordinates determines the position of a horizontal line, and that 'a' represents the y-intercept. This error likely stems from a confusion with the general equation of a line (y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept) and the equation for a hyperbola (xy = a, which is a different type of curve altogether).

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Graphing a horizontal line: When asked to graph a horizontal line with a given y-intercept, the student will incorrectly use the equation xy = a and attempt to plot points based on this equation, leading to an incorrect graph.
- Finding the equation of a horizontal line: Given a horizontal line with a specific y-intercept, the student will write the equation in the form xy = a, instead of recognizing that a horizontal line has a constant y-value and its equation should be in the form y = a.
- Solving problems involving horizontal lines: When solving problems that involve finding the intersection point of a horizontal line with another line or curve, the student's misconception will lead to incorrect calculations and solutions."
1145,"When adding column vectors, multiplies rather than adds","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with column vectors and are required to add them together. Instead of adding the corresponding components of the vectors, students with this misconception will multiply them. This may be due to a lack of understanding of vector addition or a misunderstanding of the rules for combining vectors.

For example, given two column vectors:

Vector A = [2]
         [3]

Vector B = [4]
         [5]

When asked to add Vector A and Vector B, students with this misconception may respond with:

Vector A + Vector B = [2*4]
                     [3*5]

Resulting in an incorrect answer of [8]
                                  [15]

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When solving problems involving the addition of displacement or velocity vectors in physics.
- When combining vectors in geometry to find the resultant vector.
- When working with vectors in computer graphics or engineering to perform transformations.
- When solving problems involving vector addition in navigation, such as finding the resultant direction of two or more forces."
1146,"When solving simultaneous equations, believes the terms must be of opposite signs in order to be eliminated.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the method of elimination for solving simultaneous equations. They may initially learn that by adding or subtracting two equations, they can eliminate one of the variables if the coefficients of that variable are the same but with opposite signs (e.g., +2x and -2x). However, they may incorrectly generalize this rule to believe that the terms must always be of opposite signs in order to be eliminated.

In reality, the requirement for elimination is that the coefficients of the variable to be eliminated must be the same, but not necessarily with opposite signs. This misconception can lead to confusion when students encounter equations where the coefficients are the same but with the same sign (e.g., +2x and +2x), or when they need to multiply one or both of the equations by a constant to make the coefficients the same.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: The student is given two equations, 2x + 3y = 7 and 2x - 2y = -3, and tries to eliminate the x-variable by subtracting the two equations, but believes it won't work because the coefficients of x are not opposite signs.
- Case 2: The student is given two equations, x + 4y = 10 and 3x + 4y = 16, and tries to eliminate the y-variable by subtracting the two equations, but doesn't realize that they can multiply the first equation by -1 to make the coefficients of y opposite in sign.
- Case 3: The student is given two equations, 5x + 2y = 11 and 5x + 3y = 14, and believes that they cannot eliminate the x-variable because the coefficients are the same but with the same sign."
1147,"When solving a 'more than' problem, believes the first step is to halve the total rather than setting up an equation to help solve","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with a 'more than' problem, where they are given a total amount and told that one quantity is a certain amount more than another. Instead of representing the problem as an equation, where the total is equal to the sum of the two quantities, they mistakenly think that the first step is to halve the total. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the concept of 'more than' and how it translates to a mathematical equation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Sarah has 15 more pencils than Tom. If they have 37 pencils in total, how many pencils does Tom have? (Student may halve 37 instead of setting up an equation).
* A bookshelf has 25 more books than a nearby shelf. If the total number of books is 71, how many books are on the nearby shelf? (Student may halve 71 instead of setting up an equation).
* A bakery sells 18 more cakes than a nearby bakery. If they sell 43 cakes in total, how many cakes does the nearby bakery sell? (Student may halve 43 instead of setting up an equation)."
1148,Uses an incorrect side length when splitting a composite shape into parts,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area or perimeter of a composite shape by breaking it down into simpler shapes. Instead of using the correct side lengths of each individual shape, they incorrectly identify or measure the sides, leading to inaccurate calculations. This can happen when students misunderstand the dimensions of the individual shapes, misinterpret the scale or units, or fail to account for shared sides between shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is asked to find the area of a composite shape consisting of a rectangle and a triangle. They incorrectly use the length of the rectangle as the base of the triangle, instead of the actual base of the triangle.
2. When calculating the perimeter of a composite shape made up of two rectangles, a student uses the width of one rectangle as the length of the other, resulting in an incorrect total perimeter.
3. A student is given a composite shape consisting of a square and a right-angled triangle. They mistakenly use the hypotenuse of the triangle as one of the sides of the square, leading to incorrect area and perimeter calculations."
1149,Believes perpendicular is the term used to describe two lines that are parallel,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definitions of perpendicular and parallel lines. They may think that the term ""perpendicular"" refers to lines that never intersect and are always the same distance apart, which is actually the definition of parallel lines. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the spatial relationships between lines and the precise meanings of mathematical terms.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify and label pairs of lines in a diagram, they may incorrectly label parallel lines as perpendicular.
- When solving problems involving the construction of shapes, students may attempt to draw perpendicular lines by drawing parallel lines instead.
- In real-world applications, such as designing buildings or bridges, students may incorrectly use the term ""perpendicular"" to describe parallel lines, leading to confusion and potential errors.
- When working with coordinate geometry, students may mistakenly believe that lines with the same slope are perpendicular, when in fact they are parallel."
1150,Does not believe you can scale up a proportional statement,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand that proportional relationships remain constant even when the quantities involved are multiplied or scaled up. They may believe that the proportion only holds true for the specific numbers given in the initial problem, and that it cannot be applied to larger or smaller quantities. This limited understanding can lead to difficulties in solving problems that involve scaling up or down, such as enlarging or reducing shapes, or adjusting recipes.

This misconception can occur in various cases, including:

* A recipe for 4 people requires 2 cups of flour. If the student is asked to make the recipe for 8 people, they may not realize that they can simply multiply the amount of flour by 2, and instead may try to re-calculate the entire recipe.
* A shape has a ratio of 2:3 for its length to width. If the student is asked to enlarge the shape to twice its original size, they may not understand that the new ratio will still be 2:3, and instead may try to re-calculate the dimensions.
* A car travels 50 miles in 1 hour. If the student is asked to find the distance traveled in 2 hours, they may not realize that they can simply multiply the distance by 2, and instead may try to re-calculate the speed and time."
1151,Believes they can round when converting units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that they can round numbers during the process of converting units, which can lead to inaccurate results. For instance, when converting between units of measurement such as length, mass, or capacity, students may incorrectly round the conversion factor or the original measurement, resulting in a loss of precision. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the importance of maintaining precision during unit conversions or from a tendency to simplify calculations by rounding numbers prematurely.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 5.67 meters to centimeters: A student might round 5.67 meters to 5.7 meters before converting it to centimeters, resulting in an inaccurate answer.
- Converting 2.45 kilograms to grams: A student may round 2.45 kilograms to 2.5 kilograms before converting it to grams, leading to an incorrect result.
- Converting 3.78 liters to milliliters: A student might round 3.78 liters to 3.8 liters before converting it to milliliters, causing an error in the final answer."
1152,"When dividing fractions, does the reciprocal of the first fraction instead of the second","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing fractions. They may mistakenly believe that to divide two fractions, they need to take the reciprocal of the first fraction instead of the second fraction. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of the division process. 

For example, given the problem 1/2 ÷ 1/3, students with this misconception may incorrectly take the reciprocal of the first fraction (1/2 becomes 2/1) and then multiply, resulting in an incorrect solution.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* Dividing two fractions with different denominators: 3/4 ÷ 2/5
* Dividing a fraction by a whole number: 2/3 ÷ 4
* Dividing a mixed number by a fraction: 2 1/2 ÷ 3/4
* Solving real-world problems involving division of fractions, such as sharing a pizza or dividing a recipe ingredient."
1153,Believes they can ignore the coefficient when expanding double brackets ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are expanding double brackets in algebra, particularly when there is a coefficient in front of one or both of the brackets. They may believe that the coefficient only applies to one term or that it can be ignored altogether, rather than distributing it to all terms when expanding the brackets. This can lead to incorrect expansion and ultimately, an incorrect solution.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Expanding (2x + 3)(x + 4) and ignoring the coefficient 2 when multiplying it with the terms in the second bracket.
- Expanding (x + 2)(3x - 1) and not distributing the 3 to both terms in the first bracket.
- Expanding (4x - 2)(x + 1) and not applying the coefficient 4 to the constant term -2 when multiplying it with the terms in the second bracket."
1154,Believes midpoints are plotted on histograms,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that midpoints, also known as mid-interval values, should be plotted as individual data points on a histogram. They may think that these midpoints represent actual data values, rather than being a way to represent a range of values within an interval. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly interpret and create histograms, as they may attempt to plot the midpoint values as individual data points rather than using them as a way to represent the frequency of values within a range.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When creating a histogram from a set of continuous data, a student might plot the midpoint of each interval (e.g., 5, 10, 15) as individual data points, rather than using them to represent the frequency of values within each interval (e.g., 0-10, 10-20, etc.).
2. When interpreting a histogram, a student might mistakenly believe that the midpoints represent actual data values, leading them to incorrectly conclude that a particular value is more or less common than it actually is.
3. When comparing two histograms, a student might incorrectly compare the midpoints of each interval, rather than comparing the frequencies or distributions of the data."
1155,Starts at the wrong end of the dividend when dividing,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students start the division process from the wrong end of the dividend, typically starting from the right (ones place) instead of the left (hundreds or thousands place). This can lead to incorrect quotients and remainders. When dividing, students should start by dividing the largest place value of the dividend by the divisor, working their way down to the smaller place values.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a multi-digit number by a single-digit number (e.g., 432 ÷ 6).
- When dividing a multi-digit number by a multi-digit number (e.g., 945 ÷ 15).
- When solving word problems that involve division, such as sharing a certain number of objects into groups (e.g., 18 cookies shared among 3 people)."
1156,"When dividing a fraction by an integer, divides the denominator by the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer and mistakenly think that they need to divide the denominator of the fraction by the integer, rather than inverting and multiplying or dividing the numerator by the integer and keeping the denominator the same or dividing the whole fraction by the integer. This can lead to incorrect results, especially if the integer is not a factor of the denominator.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- 1/2 ÷ 3: A student with this misconception may divide the denominator (2) by 3, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- 3/4 ÷ 2: The student may divide the denominator (4) by 2, getting 2, and keeping the numerator the same, resulting in an incorrect answer of 3/2.
- 2/3 ÷ 4: The student may attempt to divide the denominator (3) by 4, which will not result in a whole number, and lead to confusion."
1157,Rounds every number up when estimating,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that estimating a number always involves rounding up to the nearest whole number, ten, hundred, or thousand. They may think that rounding up is the only way to estimate, regardless of the context or the actual value of the number. This misconception can lead to inaccurate estimates and calculations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Estimating the number of objects in a container: If a student is asked to estimate the number of pencils in a jar and they see 43 pencils, they may round up to 50 pencils, even if 40 would be a more reasonable estimate.
- Rounding numbers for calculations: When performing calculations, students may round up every number, even if it would be more accurate to round down or keep the original value. For example, if a calculation involves the numbers 23 and 17, they may round both numbers up to 30 and 20, resulting in an inaccurate answer.
- Estimating measurements: When estimating measurements, such as the length of a room or the weight of an object, students may always round up to the nearest whole number, even if a more accurate estimate would be to round down or keep the original value.
- Real-world applications: This misconception can also occur in real-world scenarios, such as estimating the cost of items, the number of people attending an event, or the amount of time needed to complete a task."
1158,Believes you can go above an amount of money when finding how much of something you can buy,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to determine the quantity of items they can purchase with a given amount of money, but they fail to recognize that they cannot exceed the available funds. They may incorrectly assume that they can buy a fraction of an item or go over budget, not understanding that they are limited by the amount of money they have. This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of real-world constraints and the concept of budgeting.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given £5 to buy pencils that cost £1 each and calculates that they can buy 5.5 pencils, not realizing that they cannot purchase a fraction of a pencil.
- A student is asked to determine how many toys they can buy with £10, and each toy costs £3. They calculate that they can buy 3.33 toys, not understanding that they can only buy 3 toys with the available funds.
- A student is given a budget of £20 to buy books that cost £5 each and calculates that they can buy 4.2 books, not recognizing that they can only afford 4 books."
1159,"When comparing non like surds, does not square the surds","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are comparing non-like surds, such as √3 and √5. They may incorrectly compare the numbers inside the square root sign without squaring them, leading to incorrect conclusions about their relative sizes. Students may assume that the surd with the larger number inside the square root sign is larger, without realizing that the actual value of the surd depends on the square root of that number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing √10 and √20: Students may think that √20 is twice as large as √10, without realizing that the actual values are closer than that.
- Ordering a list of non-like surds: Students may incorrectly order a list of surds, such as √3, √5, and √7, based on the size of the numbers inside the square root sign rather than their actual values.
- Solving inequalities involving non-like surds: Students may incorrectly solve inequalities, such as √x > √5, without squaring both sides to compare the values correctly."
1160,Thinks you can find missing values in a given table by treating the row as a sequence of consecutive numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a table of values represents a simple sequence of consecutive numbers. They assume that each row in the table forms an arithmetic sequence, where each number is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous number. As a result, when faced with finding missing values in the table, they attempt to identify the pattern by looking for a common difference between consecutive numbers in the row.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly fill in missing values, as they may not consider other factors that could be influencing the data, such as non-linear relationships or more complex patterns.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given a table showing the number of legs on different animals, with some values missing. They assume that the number of legs increases by 1 or 2 for each successive animal, and fill in the missing values accordingly.
- A student is presented with a table of temperatures recorded at different times of day, with some readings missing. They assume that the temperature increases or decreases by a fixed amount each hour, and attempt to fill in the missing values based on this assumption.
- A student is given a table showing the cost of different items, with some prices missing. They assume that the prices increase by a fixed amount for each successive item, and fill in the missing values accordingly."
1161,Thinks 1 square metre = 10 square centimetres,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty converting between units of measurement, specifically between square metres (m²) and square centimetres (cm²). The student mistakenly thinks that 1 square metre is equivalent to 10 square centimetres, which indicates a lack of understanding of the relationship between these units. In reality, 1 square metre is much larger than 10 square centimetres.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the area of a room in square metres to the area of a small object in square centimetres.
- When solving problems involving conversion between different units of area measurement.
- When visualizing and estimating the size of different areas in real-life scenarios.
- When reading and interpreting scales or measurements on diagrams, maps, or plans.
- When calculating the area of shapes or objects in different contexts, such as in construction, design, or science."
1162,Mixes up the inequality signs in an error interval,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty in understanding the concept of error intervals and the corresponding inequality signs. Error intervals, often used in measurement and data analysis, represent a range of values within which a true value is likely to lie. The inequality signs (e.g., <, >, ≤, ≥) are used to indicate the range of the interval.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly use or swap the inequality signs, which can change the entire meaning of the error interval. For example, if the error interval is given as 5 ± 2, the student might write the inequality as 5 ≤ x ≥ 3 or 7 instead of the correct 3 ≤ x ≤ 7.

This misconception may occur in various cases, such as:

- When writing error intervals for measurements, e.g., the length of a room is 10m ± 0.5m.
- When calculating confidence intervals in statistics, e.g., a 95% confidence interval for the mean of a dataset.
- When solving problems involving margins of error, e.g., a thermometer reading with a ± 0.5°C margin of error.
- When interpreting the results of scientific experiments, e.g., a measurement of the time it takes for a ball to fall a certain distance with a ± 0.1 second error."
1163,Does not understand you can round to numbers other than powers of 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that rounding numbers can only be done to the nearest power of 10, such as 10, 100, or 1000. They may struggle to comprehend that rounding can also be done to other numbers, like 5, 25, or any other specified value. This limited understanding can lead to difficulties in real-world applications, where rounding to specific values is often required.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to round a number to the nearest 5, a student may round to the nearest 10 instead.
- In a measurement activity, students are required to round the length of an object to the nearest 25 cm, but they may insist on rounding to the nearest 100 cm.
- In a mathematical problem, students are asked to round a calculated answer to the nearest 50, but they may incorrectly round to the nearest 100.
- When working with money, students may be asked to round a price to the nearest 25 cents, but they may round to the nearest dollar instead.
- In a scientific experiment, students are required to round measurements to the nearest 0.5, but they may incorrectly round to the nearest whole number."
1164,Believes linear sequences cannot include fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow understanding of linear sequences and believe that they can only consist of whole numbers. They may have been predominantly exposed to sequences with whole number terms and may not have encountered sequences that include fractions, leading them to assume that fractions are not allowed in linear sequences. As a result, when presented with a sequence that includes fractions, they may struggle to identify it as a linear sequence or may incorrectly conclude that it is not a linear sequence due to the presence of fractions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When a sequence starts with a whole number but has a fractional common difference (e.g., 1, 1 1/2, 2, 2 1/2, ...).
- When a sequence has a fractional starting term but a whole number common difference (e.g., 1/2, 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2, ...).
- When a sequence has both fractional starting terms and fractional common differences (e.g., 1/4, 3/4, 5/4, 7/4, ...).
- When solving real-world problems that involve sequences with fractional terms, such as measuring the growth of a plant or calculating the cost of goods sold in fractions of a unit."
1165,Rounds to the nearest integer rather than one significant figure,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round a number to one significant figure, but instead, they round it to the nearest integer. They tend to focus on the decimal part of the number and round up or down to the nearest whole number, rather than considering the place value of the first significant digit.

For example, when rounding the number 4.97 to one significant figure, a student with this misconception may round it to 5 (the nearest integer) instead of 5.0 (one significant figure). Similarly, when rounding 0.047 to one significant figure, they may round it to 0 (the nearest integer) instead of 0.05 (one significant figure).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Rounding large or small measurements, like 456,789.23 meters or 0.0004567 grams, to one significant figure.
- Simplifying calculations involving decimal numbers, like 4.97 x 10^3 or 0.047 x 10^-2.
- Reporting data or results to one significant figure, such as a survey result showing 4.97% of respondents agreed with a statement, or a scientific experiment yielding a result of 0.047 grams.
- Solving problems involving significant figures in algebraic expressions, like (4.97 x 10^2) + (0.047 x 10^3)."
1166,"When subtracting a fraction from a mixed number, assumes they subtract the numerator from the integer and the numerator of the mixed number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully understanding the concept of mixed numbers and fractions. They tend to treat the integer part of the mixed number and the numerator of the fraction as separate entities, rather than understanding that the mixed number represents a single value. As a result, when subtracting a fraction from a mixed number, they incorrectly subtract the numerator of the fraction from the integer part of the mixed number, and then subtract the numerator of the fraction from the numerator of the mixed number. This shows a lack of understanding of how to perform operations with mixed numbers and fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting 1/4 from 2 3/4: Student may subtract 1 from 2 (resulting in 1) and then subtract 1 from 3 (resulting in 2), yielding an incorrect answer of 1 2/4.
- Subtracting 2/3 from 5 1/3: Student may subtract 2 from 5 (resulting in 3) and then subtract 2 from 1 (resulting in -1), yielding an incorrect answer of 3 -1/3.
- Subtracting 3/5 from 4 2/5: Student may subtract 3 from 4 (resulting in 1) and then subtract 3 from 2 (resulting in -1), yielding an incorrect answer of 1 -1/5."
1167,Does not recognise millimetres as a unit of length,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are not familiar with the unit of measurement ""millimetres"" or do not understand its relationship to other units of length, such as centimetres and metres. They may not recognize that millimetres are a smaller unit of measurement than centimetres and metres, or they may not know how to convert between these units.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When measuring the length of small objects, such as the width of a pencil or the thickness of a book, students may not consider millimetres as a suitable unit of measurement.
- When reading scales or rulers with millimetre markings, students may not understand what these markings represent or how to use them to measure lengths.
- When comparing lengths measured in different units, such as centimetres and millimetres, students may not be able to convert between the units or understand which unit is more appropriate for a particular measurement.
- When solving problems involving lengths measured in millimetres, such as calculating the perimeter of a shape with sides measured in millimetres, students may not recognize the unit or know how to work with it."
1168,Believes both the x and y co-ordinates of the x-intercept of a quadratic are derived from the constants in the factorised form.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with quadratic equations in their factorised form, typically in the format of y = a(x - r)(x - s), where r and s are the roots of the equation. The x-intercept is the point where the graph crosses the x-axis, meaning the y-coordinate is 0. The misconception is that the student believes both the x and y coordinates of the x-intercept are derived directly from the constants in the factorised form (r and s), rather than understanding that the x-coordinate is indeed related to the roots (r and s), but the y-coordinate is always 0, by definition of the x-intercept.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When finding the x-intercept of a quadratic equation in factorised form, such as y = (x - 2)(x - 3), and thinking the y-coordinate could be something other than 0.
- When comparing the x-intercepts of different quadratic equations and thinking that the y-coordinates could vary based on the equation.
- When graphing a quadratic equation and labeling the x-intercept with a non-zero y-coordinate."
1169,Does not know that cubic means the same as cubed in units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or misunderstand the terminology used to describe units of measurement, particularly the term ""cubic"" in relation to volume. They may not realize that ""cubic"" is equivalent to ""cubed"" (e.g., cubic meters = meters cubed, m³). This misunderstanding can lead to confusion when working with units of volume, causing errors in calculations and conversions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the volume of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a rectangular prism, and the student is unsure of how to express the unit of measurement.
- When converting between different units of volume, such as from cubic centimeters (cm³) to cubic meters (m³), and the student does not recognize the equivalence of ""cubic"" and ""cubed"".
- When solving real-world problems involving volume, such as measuring the capacity of a container or the volume of a substance, and the student misinterprets the unit of measurement.
- When reading or interpreting diagrams, graphs, or charts that include units of volume, and the student is unsure of what ""cubic"" represents."
1170,Confuses the order of the digits in stick multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the placement of digits during the stick multiplication process. Stick multiplication, also known as the ""stick method"" or ""expanded algorithm,"" is a visual representation of the multiplication process where each digit of one number is multiplied by each digit of another number. Students who hold this misconception may swap the positions of the digits or incorrectly align the partial products, leading to an incorrect final answer.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Multiplying multi-digit numbers, e.g., 43 × 27, where students might confuse the positions of the tens and ones digits.
* Multiplying numbers with zeros, e.g., 50 × 34, where students might misplace the zeros in the partial products.
* Multiplying numbers with repeated digits, e.g., 33 × 44, where students might get confused with the identical digits in the multiplicand and multiplier."
1171,"When solving a problem using written division (bus-stop method), puts the dividend in the wrong place","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the layout and placement of numbers in the bus-stop method of written division. They may place the dividend (the number being divided) in the wrong position, such as inside the ""bus stop"" or below the divisor (the number by which we are dividing), rather than outside and above the ""bus stop"" line. This incorrect placement can lead to confusion and incorrect calculations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a multi-digit number by a single-digit number, students may place the dividend inside the bus stop, forgetting to leave space for the quotient (result of the division).
- When the divisor has multiple digits, students may incorrectly place the dividend below the divisor, rather than aligning it with the top of the ""bus stop"".
- In problems with multiple steps, such as dividing a multi-digit number by a multi-digit number, students may misplace the dividend in subsequent steps, leading to a series of errors."
1172,Thinks any 2 values multiplied together can be denoted with a squared symbol,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any two values multiplied together can be represented using a squared symbol (²), regardless of whether the values are the same or different. They may think that the squared symbol is a shorthand notation for any multiplication operation involving two numbers.

For example, when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student writes 2 × 3 as 2³ or 3², thinking that the squared symbol can be used to represent any multiplication of two numbers.
- Case 2: When solving an algebraic expression, a student simplifies 4 × 5 as 4² or 5², demonstrating a misunderstanding of the correct application of the squared symbol.
- Case 3: A student mistakenly writes the area of a rectangle with length 6 and width 4 as 6² or 4², rather than the correct 6 × 4.
- Case 4: When working with exponents, a student incorrectly simplifies 2 × 2 × 3 as 2²³, combining the multiplication operation with the exponentiation operation."
1173,Uses the numerator of an improper fraction as the denominator of the equivalent mixed number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting improper fractions to mixed numbers. They mistakenly use the numerator of the improper fraction as the denominator of the equivalent mixed number, rather than dividing the numerator by the denominator to find the whole number part and then writing the remainder as the new numerator. This error demonstrates a lack of understanding of the relationship between improper fractions and mixed numbers, as well as the procedures for converting between the two.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting an improper fraction like 5/3 to a mixed number, the student may incorrectly write the mixed number as 3 5 (using 5 as the denominator) instead of dividing 5 by 3 to get 1 with a remainder of 2, resulting in the correct mixed number 1 2/3.
- When dealing with larger numbers, such as the improper fraction 17/4, the student may mistakenly write the mixed number as 4 17 instead of dividing 17 by 4 to get 4 with a remainder of 1, resulting in the correct mixed number 4 1/4.
- In word problems, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, the student may incorrectly convert an improper fraction like 9/2 to a mixed number, writing 2 9 instead of dividing 9 by 2 to get 4 with a remainder of 1, resulting in the correct mixed number 4 1/2."
1174,Believes the mean from grouped data is the sum of the midpoints divided by something,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the mean from grouped data, but they are unsure of what to divide the sum of the midpoints by. They may incorrectly assume that it's the number of groups, the number of midpoints, the range of the data, or some other quantity. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with a large dataset that is grouped into intervals, and students need to calculate the mean of the data.
- When working with a histogram or a frequency table, and students are asked to find the mean of the data.
- When comparing the means of two or more datasets, and students are unsure of how to calculate the mean from grouped data.
- When solving problems that involve calculating the mean of a dataset that is presented in a grouped format, such as in a table or chart.
- When working on projects that involve collecting and analyzing real-world data, and students need to calculate the mean from grouped data."
1175,Uses base instead of height as h in area of a trapezium formula,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a trapezium using the formula A = 1/2 * (a + b) * h. They mistakenly use the length of the base (either 'a' or 'b') as the height 'h' instead of the perpendicular distance between the bases. This error can occur due to a lack of understanding of the formula and the properties of trapeziums.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When finding the area of a trapezium with bases of 8cm and 10cm, and the length of the longer base (10cm) is used as the height 'h' instead of the actual height.
2. In a real-world problem, such as finding the area of a trapezoidal garden bed with bases of 5m and 7m, and the student uses the length of one of the bases as the height instead of measuring the actual height.
3. When solving a problem involving a trapezium with bases of 4cm and 6cm, and the student assumes that the height 'h' is the same as the length of the shorter base (4cm)."
1176,Confuses isosceles and equilateral triangles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that any triangle with two equal sides (isosceles) is the same as a triangle with all three equal sides (equilateral), or vice versa. They may also incorrectly assume that if a triangle has two equal angles, it must be equilateral. This misconception arises from a lack of understanding of the specific properties of each type of triangle. 

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify or draw an isosceles triangle, a student may consistently draw an equilateral triangle.
- When given an equilateral triangle, a student may incorrectly label it as isosceles, thinking that the terms are interchangeable.
- In a problem where a triangle has two equal angles, a student may automatically conclude that it is an equilateral triangle, without considering other possibilities.
- When solving problems involving the properties of isosceles and equilateral triangles, such as finding the measure of angles or sides, students may apply the wrong properties, leading to incorrect solutions."
1177,Identifies the biggest value for the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the range is the largest value in a dataset, rather than the difference between the largest and smallest values. This misunderstanding can lead students to simply pick out the largest number in the dataset, ignoring the smallest value and the actual spread of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the range of a set of exam scores, a student might identify the highest score as the range, rather than subtracting the lowest score from the highest score.
- When comparing the range of two different datasets, a student might incorrectly conclude that the dataset with the highest value has the greater range, without considering the lowest value in each dataset.
- When analyzing a graph or chart, a student might mistakenly identify the highest point on the graph as the range, rather than calculating the difference between the highest and lowest points."
1178,Does not count both edges when turning a corner when counting perimeter,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to calculate the perimeter of a shape, particularly one with corners or turns. They may only count one edge when turning a corner, rather than counting both edges that meet at the corner. This could be due to a lack of understanding that the perimeter is the total distance around a shape, and that every edge, regardless of its orientation or position, contributes to this total distance.

This misconception may arise in the following cases:

- When calculating the perimeter of an L-shape or a rectangle with a corner cut off.
- When counting the perimeter of a complex shape with multiple corners, such as a polygon with many sides.
- When working with real-world objects, such as the perimeter of a room or a garden bed with corners.
- When asked to calculate the perimeter of a shape with multiple turns or bends, such as a zig-zag or a curved shape approximated by straight edges."
1179,Forgets to multiply up for the correct time frame in a worded question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with word problems involving time frames and rates, but they fail to adjust the calculation to account for the correct time period. This can happen when the question requires the student to find a total amount, cost, or quantity over a certain period, but the student only calculates the rate or amount for a single unit of time, forgetting to multiply it by the number of time units.

For example:

* A water tank can hold 500 liters of water. If 200 liters of water flow into the tank every hour, how much water will the tank hold after 3 hours? (Student only calculates 200 liters, forgetting to multiply by 3 hours)
* A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. If they operate 7 days a week, how many loaves of bread do they sell in a week? (Student only calculates 250 loaves, forgetting to multiply by 7 days)
* A car travels 250 miles in 5 hours. If it travels for 15 hours, how many miles will it have traveled? (Student only calculates 250 miles, forgetting to multiply by 3, since 15 hours is 3 times 5 hours)"
1180,Does not know the properties of a rectangle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to recall or apply the basic properties of a rectangle, which is a fundamental concept in geometry. A rectangle is a type of quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides of equal length. Students with this misconception may struggle to identify or create rectangles, or to solve problems involving rectangles, as they do not understand the defining characteristics of this shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to draw or identify a rectangle, students may draw or choose a shape with non-right angles or unequal opposite sides.
- When solving problems involving perimeter or area of a rectangle, students may incorrectly calculate the perimeter or area due to a lack of understanding of the relationships between the sides.
- When classifying shapes, students may incorrectly categorize a rectangle as a different type of quadrilateral, such as a square or a trapezoid.
- When real-world applications involve rectangles, such as designing a room or a garden bed, students may struggle to apply the properties of a rectangle to solve the problem."
1181,When solving an equation thinks they divide when in fact they need to multiply,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with an equation that involves a fraction or a coefficient that needs to be ""cleared"" in order to solve for the variable. They may mistakenly believe that dividing by the coefficient or fraction will isolate the variable, when in fact, multiplying by its reciprocal is the correct operation. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of inverse operations, or a failure to recognize the need to ""undo"" the effect of the coefficient or fraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Solving an equation like 2x = 6, where the student might divide by 2 instead of multiplying by 1/2 (although in this case, both operations will give the same result, but the misconception will become more apparent in more complex equations).
* Solving an equation like x/4 = 3, where the student might divide by 4 instead of multiplying by 4 to clear the fraction.
* Solving an equation like 3/4x = 2, where the student might divide by 3/4 instead of multiplying by 4/3 to isolate x."
1182,"Believes only the decimal places with dots above them recur, not the whole string","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to recurring decimals, which are often represented with dots above the recurring digits. However, some students may misinterpret the dots to mean that only the digits directly below the dots are recurring, rather than the entire sequence of digits. They may think that the dots ""select"" which digits repeat, rather than indicating the start of the recurring pattern.

For example, in the recurring decimal 0.123˙4˙5, students with this misconception might believe that only the digits 4 and 5 recur, resulting in the incorrect sequence: 0.1234545... rather than the correct sequence: 0.123454545...

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When converting fractions to decimals, e.g., 22/99 = 0.22˙2˙
* When adding or subtracting recurring decimals, e.g., 0.4˙5˙ + 0.2˙5˙
* When multiplying or dividing recurring decimals, e.g., 0.4˙5˙ × 2
* When simplifying algebraic expressions involving recurring decimals, e.g., 2x + 0.4˙5˙ = 5.6˙5˙."
1183,Does not include units in answer.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students provide numerical answers to measurement or calculation problems without including the relevant units. For instance, when calculating the area of a room, a student might simply write ""12"" instead of ""12 square meters"" or when calculating the volume of a container, they might write ""5"" instead of ""5 liters"". This lack of units can make the answer ambiguous and incomplete.

This misconception can manifest in various cases, such as:

- Calculating the perimeter of a shape and only providing the numerical value without including the unit of length (e.g., meters, centimeters).
- Determining the capacity of a container and not specifying the unit of volume (e.g., liters, milliliters).
- Finding the area of a surface and not including the unit of area (e.g., square meters, square centimeters).
- Measuring the length of an object and not recording the unit of measurement (e.g., meters, inches).
- Solving speed or velocity problems and not including the unit of speed (e.g., meters per second, kilometers per hour)."
1184,Identifies the wrong part of a fraction model as the whole,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of a fraction and identifying the whole, or the entire unit, in a fraction model. They may mistakenly identify a part of the model as the whole, rather than recognizing the entire model as the whole.

For example, if a student is presented with a model of a pizza divided into 8 equal slices, with 3 of the slices shaded, they may incorrectly identify the 3 shaded slices as the whole, rather than recognizing the entire pizza as the whole.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing or interpreting diagrams of fractions, such as circles, rectangles, or other shapes divided into equal parts.
- When solving problems that involve identifying the whole in a fraction, such as ""What is the whole if 3/8 of a pizza is eaten?""
- When comparing fractions and needing to identify the whole to determine which fraction is larger or smaller.
- When solving word problems that involve fractions, such as ""Tom has 1/4 of a bag of apples. If the bag contains 12 apples, how many apples does Tom have?"" and the student incorrectly identifies the 1/4 as the whole."
1185,"When rationalising the denominator, believes only the numerator or the denominator needs to be multiplied by the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to rationalising the denominator in algebra, particularly when dealing with surds. They may think that to rationalise the denominator, they only need to multiply either the numerator or the denominator by the surd, rather than multiplying both by the conjugate of the denominator. This is often due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of rationalising the denominator, which is to remove the surd from the denominator.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When simplifying expressions such as 1 / (√2), students may think they only need to multiply the numerator by √2 to rationalise the denominator.
* When working with fractions involving surds, such as (√3) / (√5), students may believe that multiplying only the numerator or denominator by √5 is sufficient to rationalise the denominator.
* In more complex expressions, such as (2 + √3) / (√7), students may think that multiplying only the numerator or denominator by √7 will rationalise the denominator."
1186,"Believes when identifying the mode you look at all values, not just frequencies, for the highest number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the mode is the highest value in a dataset, rather than the value that appears most frequently. They focus on the magnitude of the numbers rather than their frequency of occurrence. As a result, they incorrectly identify the mode as the largest number in the dataset, rather than the value that is most common.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: In a dataset with extreme outliers (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 2, 100), students may incorrectly identify the mode as 100, which is the highest value, rather than 2, which is the most frequent value.
- Case 2: When comparing two datasets (e.g., Dataset A: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and Dataset B: 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), students may incorrectly conclude that Dataset A has a higher mode because it contains higher values, rather than recognizing that Dataset B has a clear mode of 2.
- Case 3: In a dataset with multiple modes (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 2, 3), students may incorrectly identify the mode as 3, which is the highest value, rather than recognizing that both 1 and 2 are modes since they appear with the same frequency."
1187,Does not realise that gradient represents rate of change,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the gradient of a line as simply a numerical value or a measure of steepness, without understanding its deeper significance as a rate of change. They may fail to recognize that the gradient represents the change in the dependent variable (y) for a one-unit change in the independent variable (x). As a result, students may not fully appreciate the practical implications of the gradient in real-world contexts.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When finding the gradient of a line and stating it as a numerical value without considering its units or physical significance.
* When comparing the steepness of two lines without considering the context and the units of the variables involved.
* When solving problems involving rates of change, such as motion, growth, or finance, without recognizing the role of the gradient in representing these rates.
* When interpreting graphs and failing to recognize that the gradient represents a rate of change, rather than just a measure of steepness.
* When working with non-linear relationships and failing to recognize that the gradient changes at different points on the curve, representing changing rates of change."
1188,Reads the wrong scale on the protractor when measuring obtuse angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are using a protractor to measure obtuse angles (angles greater than 90 degrees) and mistakenly read the inner scale (usually used for measuring acute angles) instead of the outer scale. The protractor has two sets of numbers, one on the inner scale (0-90 degrees) and another on the outer scale (0-180 degrees). When measuring obtuse angles, students should read the outer scale. However, they often mistakenly read the inner scale, resulting in incorrect measurements.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When measuring the angle between two intersecting lines that form an obtuse angle.
- When finding the angle between two adjacent sides of an obtuse-angled triangle.
- When measuring the reflex angle of a shape, which involves measuring the obtuse angle on the other side of the reflex angle.
- When solving problems involving the sum of angles in a polygon, and one of the angles is obtuse.
- When constructing geometric shapes, such as an obtuse-angled triangle, using a protractor to measure the angles."
1189,Does not understand that adding on to a multiple can give you the next multiple,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to recognize the pattern of multiples and how adding a fixed number to a multiple can result in the next multiple. They may not understand that multiples are obtained by adding a fixed number (the multiplier) to the previous multiple. For example, if we are counting by 5s, some students may not realize that adding 5 to a multiple of 5 will result in the next multiple of 5.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When asked to find the next multiple of 3 after 12, a student may not realize that adding 3 to 12 will give the next multiple, which is 15.
- When counting by 2s, a student may not understand that adding 2 to 10 will result in the next multiple of 2, which is 12.
- When filling in missing numbers in a hundreds chart, a student may not recognize that adding 10 to 20 will give the next multiple of 10, which is 30."
1190,"When solving an equation, subtracts instead of dividing","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with an equation that involves a coefficient or a number multiplied by the variable. In their attempt to isolate the variable, they incorrectly apply the inverse operation. Instead of dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient to solve for the variable, they subtract the coefficient from both sides. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the relationship between inverse operations, specifically that division is the inverse of multiplication, not subtraction.

Examples of cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: Solve for x in the equation 3x = 12. A student with this misconception might write: 3x - 3 = 12 - 3, instead of dividing both sides by 3.
* Case 2: Solve for y in the equation 4y = 20. A student with this misconception might write: 4y - 4 = 20 - 4, instead of dividing both sides by 4.
* Case 3: Solve for z in the equation 2z = 8. A student with this misconception might write: 2z - 2 = 8 - 2, instead of dividing both sides by 2."
1191,Believes that the sign changes when factorising an expression into single brackets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorisation of algebraic expressions. They might mistakenly believe that the sign of the terms outside the brackets changes when factorising an expression into single brackets. This misconception could stem from a lack of understanding of the distributive property of multiplication over addition or subtraction. 

For example, when factorising the expression '3x + 6', students with this misconception may incorrectly think that the factorised form is '3(x - 2)' instead of the correct '3(x + 2)'. This misconception can lead to incorrect solutions in various algebraic problems.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising the expression '2x + 4' as '2(x - 2)' instead of '2(x + 2)'
- Factorising the expression '5x - 10' as '5(x + 2)' instead of '5(x - 2)'
- Factorising the expression 'x + 3' as '(x - 3)' instead of '(x + 3)'"
1192,Believes all triangles have a right angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the properties of right-angled triangles, which are commonly introduced early in their math education. They might assume that all triangles have one 90-degree angle, as they are often exposed to examples and illustrations of right-angled triangles in real-life applications, such as buildings, stairs, and corners of rooms. As a result, they may struggle to recognize and work with triangles that do not have a right angle, such as obtuse or acute triangles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to draw or identify triangles in different contexts, they might consistently draw or look for right-angled triangles.
- When solving problems involving the angles of triangles, students may incorrectly assume that one of the angles is always 90 degrees.
- When classifying triangles, students might categorize all triangles as right-angled, without considering the possibility of obtuse or acute angles.
- When working with real-world applications, such as designing or building structures, students may incorrectly assume that all triangular shapes must have a right angle."
1193,Multiplies up without finding unit amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with multiplication problems involving scaling or proportion, particularly in real-world contexts such as measurement or money. They tend to multiply the numbers without considering the unit amount or the quantity being multiplied. This leads to incorrect answers because they fail to account for the fact that the multiplier is applied to a specific unit or quantity.

For example:

- A recipe for 4 people requires 8 cups of flour. If you want to make the recipe for 6 people, how many cups of flour do you need? A student with this misconception may simply multiply 8 by 6, resulting in 48 cups, without considering that the original 8 cups were for 4 people, and they need to find the amount for 1 person first.

- A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 boxes. If you have 3 bookshelves, how many boxes can you hold in total? A student with this misconception may multiply 3 (bookshelves) by 3 (boxes), resulting in 9 boxes, without considering that each bookshelf has 5 shelves that can hold 3 boxes each.

- A bakery sells a pack of 6 cookies for $4. If you want to buy 9 cookies, how much will it cost? A student with this misconception may multiply $4 by 9, resulting in $36, without considering that the original price was for a pack of 6 cookies, and they need to find the cost of 1 cookie first."
1194,Forgets to halve when finding the missing base angles of an isosceles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with isosceles triangles and are asked to find the measure of the missing base angles. They may recall that the base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, but they often forget the crucial step of halving the remaining angle to find the measure of each base angle. As a result, they may end up with an incorrect answer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the missing angles in an isosceles triangle, given the measure of the vertex angle.
- When solving problems involving the properties of isosceles triangles, such as finding the measure of the base angles given the measure of the vertex angle and one base angle.
- When working with more complex geometric shapes that involve isosceles triangles, such as isosceles trapezoids or rhombi.
- When solving real-world problems that involve the use of isosceles triangles, such as designing buildings or bridges.
- When solving problems that involve the use of symmetry and the properties of isosceles triangles."
1195,Gives the change in value when asked for the percentage change,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the percentage change in a value, but instead, they only provide the change in value. For example, if a shirt originally costs $20 and is now on sale for $15, students with this misconception might simply subtract $20 - $15 = $5 and provide the answer as 5, thinking that they have found the percentage change. However, percentage change requires calculating the change in value as a proportion of the original value.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* A store has a 20% off sale on all electronics. If a TV originally costs $100, how much will you save if you buy it on sale?
* A bakery increases the price of bread from $2 to $2.50. What is the percentage increase in the price of bread?
* A car's value depreciates from $10,000 to $8,000 over a year. What is the percentage decrease in the car's value?
* A company's profit increases from $500 to $600. What is the percentage increase in profit?
* A person's weight decreases from 70 kg to 65 kg. What is the percentage decrease in weight?"
1196,"When solving an equation where there is a negative sign in front of the variable at the final stage, believes they can ignore it and treat it as if it's positive","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully comfortable with the concept of negative numbers and how they interact with variables in equations. They may have previously only dealt with simple equations where the variable is always positive, and therefore assume that a negative sign in front of the variable can be ignored. They may think that the negative sign only affects the number in front of it, not the variable itself. This can lead to incorrect solutions, as ignoring the negative sign can change the entire meaning of the equation.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Solving the equation -2x = 6, a student may write x = 3, ignoring the negative sign in front of the variable.
- Solving the equation -x + 3 = 5, a student may write x = 2, treating the negative sign as if it only affects the number, not the variable.
- Solving the equation 2 - x = 4, a student may write x = -2, but when asked to write the solution, they may ignore the negative sign and write x = 2."
1197,Confuses frequency and frequency density,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between frequency, which is the number of times a value or a group of values occurs in a dataset, and frequency density, which is the frequency per unit of the group or class width. Students often mistakenly use these terms interchangeably or incorrectly calculate one for the other. They might think that the frequency is the same as the frequency density without considering the width of the class or group.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When creating or interpreting histograms, where the y-axis can represent either frequency or frequency density.
- When comparing datasets with different class widths, where frequency alone might not accurately represent the distribution of the data.
- When calculating probabilities from a grouped dataset, where frequency density is necessary to accurately determine the probability of a value falling within a certain range.
- When analyzing the distribution of data in bar charts or other graphical representations, where frequency and frequency density are used to make inferences about the data."
1198,Does not recognise that a linear sequence must increase or decrease by same amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that a linear sequence is defined by a constant difference between consecutive terms. They may believe that as long as the sequence appears to be increasing or decreasing, it can be considered linear, without recognizing the importance of a consistent increment or decrement. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly identify sequences as linear when, in fact, they are not.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When given a sequence like 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, students might think it's linear because it's increasing, without noticing the difference between terms is not constant.
- When asked to generate a linear sequence, students might produce a sequence like 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, without realizing the increment is not consistent.
- When analyzing a real-world situation, such as the cost of goods or the growth of a population, students might assume a linear relationship without verifying that the changes are occurring at a constant rate."
1199,Thinks that co-interior angles can lie on opposite sides of a transversal ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of co-interior angles. They may believe that co-interior angles are simply pairs of angles formed by a transversal and two lines, without considering the specific positional relationship between these angles. As a result, they incorrectly assume that co-interior angles can be any pair of angles on opposite sides of the transversal, rather than recognizing that co-interior angles must be on the same side of the transversal and inside the two lines.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying angles in a diagram, students might label angles on opposite sides of the transversal as co-interior angles.
- When solving problems involving transversals, students may incorrectly apply the properties of co-interior angles to angles on opposite sides of the transversal.
- In word problems or real-world applications, students might misinterpret the relationships between angles formed by a transversal, leading to incorrect conclusions about co-interior angles."
1200,Finds the IQR rather than the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the range of a dataset but instead calculate the interquartile range (IQR). The students may understand that range is a measure of spread, but they may mistakenly use the formula for IQR, which is the difference between the upper quartile (Q3) and the lower quartile (Q1), instead of finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a dataset with outliers and are asked to find the range, they might think that using IQR is a way to avoid the effect of the outliers.
- When students are working with a large dataset and are asked to find the range, they might mistakenly use the IQR formula because it is often used as a measure of spread in datasets.
- When students are asked to compare the spread of two datasets, they might calculate the IQR for both datasets instead of finding the range.
- When students are given a question that asks them to find the range of a dataset, but the question also mentions the median, upper quartile, or lower quartile, they might get confused and use the IQR formula."
1201,Finds the arc length instead of the area of the sector ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a sector, but instead of using the formula for the area of a sector (A = (θ/360) × πr^2), they mistakenly use the formula for the arc length (L = (θ/360) × 2πr). As a result, they calculate the length of the arc that forms the boundary of the sector rather than the actual area enclosed by the arc.

This misconception can arise from a misunderstanding of the relationship between the arc length and the area of a sector. Students may incorrectly assume that finding the length of the arc is equivalent to finding the area of the sector, or they may simply confuse the two formulas.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the area of a sector given the radius and central angle.
- When comparing the areas of different sectors with the same radius but different central angles.
- When solving problems involving real-world applications, such as finding the area of a circular garden bed or a sector-shaped room."
1202,Does not understand that an acute angle is between 0 and 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the definition of an acute angle. They may think that an acute angle can be any small angle, without realizing that it has a specific range of 0 to 90 degrees. This misconception can also be caused by a lack of understanding of the different types of angles (acute, obtuse, right, straight, reflex) and their corresponding degree measurements.

This misconception will occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify whether a given angle is acute, obtuse, or right, and they incorrectly classify an angle greater than 90 degrees as acute.
* When students are given a diagram with multiple angles and are asked to find the acute angles, but they include angles greater than 90 degrees in their answer.
* When students are solving problems involving the sum of angles in a triangle, and they incorrectly assume that all angles in a triangle are acute, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When students are working with real-world examples, such as building design or art, and they incorrectly use the term ""acute angle"" to describe an angle that is not between 0 and 90 degrees."
1203,Believes that to find an angle for a pie chart sector you divide the total frequency by 360 and multiply by its frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the frequency of a category in a pie chart and the corresponding angle of its sector. They incorrectly believe that to find the angle, they need to divide the total frequency by 360 and then multiply the result by the frequency of the specific category. This misconception shows a misunderstanding of proportions and percentages in the context of pie charts, leading students to incorrectly calculate sector angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to create a pie chart from a given set of data and calculate the angles of each sector.
- When students are given a pie chart with missing sector angles and are asked to calculate the angles using the given frequencies.
- When students are comparing the proportions of different categories in a pie chart and need to calculate the corresponding sector angles.
- When students are asked to interpret the results of a survey or data set and represent the findings using a pie chart, requiring them to calculate sector angles based on frequencies."
1204,Multiplied by 100 rather than divided by 100,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to convert a percentage to a decimal, they need to multiply by 100, rather than divide by 100. This can stem from a misunderstanding of the relationship between percentages and decimals, or a simple arithmetic error.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting a percentage to a decimal, e.g. 25% is incorrectly converted to 2500 instead of 0.25.
- When calculating discounts or markups, e.g. a 20% discount is incorrectly calculated as 20 x 100 = 2000, rather than 20 ÷ 100 = 0.20.
- When working with proportions, e.g. a student may think that 25% of a quantity is 25 x 100 times the quantity, rather than 25 ÷ 100 times the quantity.
- When solving problems involving interest rates, e.g. a student may calculate the interest as the principal amount multiplied by the interest rate multiplied by 100, rather than divided by 100."
1205,Thinks a variable next to a number means addition rather than multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the juxtaposition of a variable and a number as an indication of addition rather than multiplication. For example, when they see an expression like ""2x"", they may mistakenly believe that it means ""2 + x"" instead of ""2 times x"". This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of algebraic concepts.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions, such as ""3x + 4"" being interpreted as ""3 + x + 4"".
- When solving equations, like ""2x = 6"" being thought of as ""2 + x = 6"".
- When working with formulas, such as the area of a rectangle being calculated as ""length + width"" instead of ""length x width"".
- When graphing linear equations, where the slope is mistakenly added to the x-value instead of being multiplied by it.
- When solving word problems, like ""Tom has 3 groups of x pencils"" being misinterpreted as ""Tom has 3 + x pencils""."
1206,Does not understand how to maintain equivalence in fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend that equivalent fractions represent the same value, but with different numbers of equal parts. They may believe that changing the numerator or denominator of a fraction changes its value, rather than understanding that equivalent fractions are obtained by multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator by the same number.

For example, students may think that:

- 1/2 and 2/4 are not equal because the numbers are different, without realizing that the proportion of the whole remains the same.
- Multiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number changes its value, e.g., thinking that 1/2 is not equal to 3/6.
- Equivalent fractions cannot be used interchangeably in calculations, e.g., not recognizing that 2/4 can be used in place of 1/2 in a calculation.

This misconception can manifest in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying fractions, students may not recognize that 4/8 can be simplified to 1/2.
- When comparing fractions, students may not understand that 3/6 is equal to 1/2, making it difficult for them to compare the sizes of fractions.
- When performing arithmetic operations with fractions, students may not know how to find a common denominator or simplify the result."
1207,Does not realize we can write a division as a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that division can be represented in the form of a fraction. They may view division as a standalone operation and fractions as a distinct concept, without understanding the connection between the two. As a result, they may struggle to express a division problem as a fraction, and vice versa.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When asked to write 12 ÷ 4 in a different form, students may not recognize that it can be expressed as a fraction (12/4).
- When simplifying fractions, students may not realize that they can divide the numerator by the denominator to obtain a decimal or whole number value.
- When solving problems involving ratios or proportions, students may not understand that they can represent these relationships using fractions or division.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe calls for 18 cookies to be shared among 6 people. Students may not realize that this can be represented as a fraction (18/6) to find out how many cookies each person will get.
- A bookshelf has 24 books, and a student wants to put an equal number of books on each of 4 shelves. They may struggle to express this as a fraction (24/4) to determine how many books will go on each shelf.
- A student is asked to simplify the fraction 48/8 but may not recognize that this can be done by dividing 48 by 8 to get 6."
1208,Believes the subtraction button writes a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the division symbol (-) or the subtraction button is used to write or represent fractions. They may think that placing a number before the subtraction sign and another number after it will create a fraction, rather than realizing that fractions are typically represented using a forward slash (/) or a horizontal line with the numerator above and the denominator below.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When writing a fraction for the first time: A student might write 1-2 instead of 1/2.
2. Simplifying fractions: A student might think 2-4 is the simplified version of 4-8.
3. Comparing fractions: A student might compare 1-2 to 2-4 and not understand the actual values of these fractions.
4. Converting fractions to decimals: A student might struggle to convert a ""fraction"" written with the subtraction symbol to a decimal.
5. Reading fractions in word problems: A student might misinterpret a fraction written in words (e.g., ""one half"") and represent it using the subtraction symbol instead of a forward slash."
1209,Believes a mixed number can contain an improper fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of mixed numbers. A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction. However, some students may believe that it's possible to have a mixed number that contains an improper fraction, which means the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator.

For example, they might think that 3 5/4 or 2 7/3 are valid mixed numbers. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definition of a mixed number or the relationship between whole numbers and fractions.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, students may not realize that the numerator of the fraction part should be less than the denominator.
- When adding or subtracting mixed numbers, students may not recognize that the fraction part should be a proper fraction.
- When comparing mixed numbers, students may not understand that an improper fraction in the mixed number is not valid.
- When simplifying complex fractions, students may create mixed numbers with improper fractions, thinking they are correct."
1210,Does not recognise millilitres as a unit of volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand that millilitres (mL) is a unit used to measure the volume of liquids. They might confuse millilitres with other units, such as grams (which measure mass) or mistakenly believe that millilitres are used to measure other attributes like length or time. As a result, when faced with problems involving volume, students with this misconception may struggle to identify the correct unit of measurement or make incorrect conversions between units.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to measure the volume of a liquid in a science experiment, a student might respond with the weight of the liquid in grams instead of millilitres.
2. In a cooking activity, a student may be asked to measure out a certain volume of water, but they might use a scale to measure the weight instead of a measuring jug to measure the volume in millilitres.
3. When solving a problem involving the capacity of a container, a student with this misconception might give an answer in units of length or mass instead of millilitres."
1211,Believes number of squares in a bar gives frequency on a histogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number of squares or blocks within a bar in a histogram directly represents the frequency of the data. They may count the individual squares or blocks in each bar and assume that the total count is the frequency of the data point, rather than understanding that the height or length of the bar is what actually represents the frequency.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When interpreting a histogram with different scales on the x and y axes, students may focus on the visible number of squares rather than the axis labels.
- When comparing two or more histograms with different bar widths, students may incorrectly assume that the histogram with more squares has a higher frequency.
- When asked to create their own histogram, students may draw bars with a certain number of squares to represent the frequency, rather than adjusting the height or length of the bar accordingly."
1212,Thinks a greater number of shaded parts represents a greater fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the value of a fraction is determined by the number of shaded parts, rather than the proportion of shaded parts to the whole. They may focus solely on the quantity of shaded sections, without considering the total number of parts that make up the whole. As a result, they may incorrectly compare fractions, thinking that the one with more shaded parts is the greater fraction, even if the denominators are different.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Comparing 1/4 and 2/8: A student may think that 2/8 is greater than 1/4 because it has more shaded parts (2 vs 1), even though they represent the same proportion (1/4 = 2/8).
2. Comparing 3/6 and 2/4: A student may believe that 3/6 is greater than 2/4 because it has more shaded parts (3 vs 2), even though they represent the same proportion (3/6 = 2/4 = 1/2).
3. Comparing 5/10 and 3/6: A student may think that 5/10 is greater than 3/6 because it has more shaded parts (5 vs 3), even though they represent the same proportion (5/10 = 3/6 = 1/2)."
1213,"When finding the differences between terms in a sequence, believes they can do so from right to left ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the differences between consecutive terms in a sequence, but they incorrectly believe that they can calculate the differences by subtracting each term from the one to its right. In other words, they think that the differences can be found by subtracting a term from the term that comes after it, rather than subtracting a term from the term that comes before it.

For example, given the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, a student with this misconception may try to find the differences by subtracting each term from the one to its right, like this:

* 5 - 2 = 3 (correct)
* 8 - 5 = 3 (correct)
* 11 - 8 = 3 (correct)
* 14 - 11 = 3 (correct)
* But then, they might also try to find the difference between the first and second term by subtracting the first term from the second term, and also try to find the difference between the second term and the first term, by subtracting the second term from the first term: 2 - 5 = -3 (incorrect)

This misconception can also occur in other sequences, such as:

* The sequence: 10, 15, 20, 25, where a student might try to find the differences by subtracting each term from the one to its right, and also try to find the difference between the first term and the second term by subtracting the first term from the second term.
* The sequence: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, where a student might incorrectly believe that they can find the differences by subtracting each term from the one to its right."
1214,"When solving an equation, uses the same operation rather than the inverse.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that to isolate a variable in an equation, they need to perform the inverse operation of the one being applied to the variable. Instead, they mistakenly use the same operation, thinking that it will ""cancel out"" the original operation. 

For example, if the equation is 3x = 12, students with this misconception may try to solve for x by adding 3 to both sides (3x + 3 = 12 + 3), rather than dividing both sides by 3 (3x / 3 = 12 / 3). Similarly, in the equation x - 4 = 8, they might add 4 to the left side and subtract 4 from the right side (x - 4 + 4 = 8 - 4), instead of simply adding 4 to both sides (x - 4 + 4 = 8 + 4).

This misconception can be seen in various cases, such as:

- When solving linear equations, like 2x + 5 = 11, where students might add 2 to both sides instead of subtracting 5 and then dividing by 2.
- When working with multiplication and division, like 4x = 20, where students may multiply both sides by 4 instead of dividing both sides by 4.
- When dealing with more complex equations, like x / 2 + 3 = 7, where students might add 2 to both sides instead of subtracting 3 and then multiplying both sides by 2."
1215,"Includes a data point with the value, when asked to find the number of data points above a value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to determine the number of data points that fall above a specific value in a dataset. Instead of excluding the data point with the exact given value, they incorrectly include it in their count. This error occurs because students may misinterpret the instruction to find data points ""above"" a value, thinking it means ""greater than or equal to"" the value, rather than strictly ""greater than"" the value.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a dataset of exam scores, a student is asked to find the number of students who scored above 80. If a student scored exactly 80, they might incorrectly include that student in their count.
- Case 2: When analyzing the heights of students in a class, a student is asked to find the number of students taller than 160 cm. If a student's height is exactly 160 cm, they might mistakenly include that student in their count.
- Case 3: In a survey of daily temperatures, a student is asked to find the number of days with temperatures above 25°C. If a day's temperature was exactly 25°C, they might incorrectly include that day in their count."
1216,Believes a curve can show a constant rate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a curve on a graph can represent a constant rate of change. They may think that as long as the curve is smooth and continuous, it implies a steady and consistent rate of change. However, a curve typically indicates a changing rate, where the rate of change varies at different points on the curve. Students with this misconception may struggle to distinguish between linear and non-linear relationships and may incorrectly interpret the information presented in a graph.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When analyzing the motion of an object and interpreting the velocity-time graph, students might think a smooth curve represents a constant speed.
- In a real-world scenario, when looking at a graph of population growth, students may assume a smooth curve indicates a constant rate of growth.
- When working with optimization problems in calculus, students may mistakenly believe that a curve represents a constant rate of change, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In physics, when studying the motion of projectiles, students might misinterpret the curved trajectory as representing a constant velocity."
1217,Assumes the perpendicular height of a triangle bisects the base,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the perpendicular height of a triangle always divides the base into two equal parts. They may think that the perpendicular height is the same as the median of the triangle, which is not always true. In reality, the perpendicular height is a line segment drawn from a vertex of a triangle to the opposite side, forming a right angle with that side. It does not necessarily bisect the base.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When finding the area of a triangle, students may incorrectly assume that the perpendicular height divides the base into two equal parts and use this incorrect assumption to calculate the area.
* When drawing or constructing triangles, students may draw the perpendicular height as bisecting the base, leading to inaccurate diagrams.
* When solving problems involving right-angled triangles, students may assume that the perpendicular height is the same as the median, leading to incorrect calculations and answers.
* When dealing with isosceles triangles, students may assume that the perpendicular height always bisects the base, which is true for isosceles triangles but not for all triangles in general."
1218,Multiplies the numerators when adding fractions with a common denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to add fractions with a common denominator. Instead of simply adding the numerators and keeping the common denominator, they mistakenly multiply the numerators together. This may be due to the students' prior knowledge of multiplying fractions, where they multiply both the numerators and denominators. As a result, they incorrectly apply this multiplication rule to addition problems involving fractions with a common denominator.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When adding two fractions with the same denominator, such as 1/4 + 1/4, the student may multiply the numerators and write 1 x 1 = 1, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/4 instead of 2/4.
- When solving a word problem that involves adding fractions with a common denominator, such as ""Tom has 1/6 of a pizza, and his friend gives him another 1/6. What fraction of the pizza does Tom have now?"", the student may multiply the numerators and write 1 x 1 = 1, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/6 instead of 2/6.
- When simplifying an expression that involves adding fractions with a common denominator, such as 3/8 + 2/8, the student may multiply the numerators and write 3 x 2 = 6, resulting in an incorrect answer of 6/8 instead of 5/8."
1219,Gives the value for the wrong variable when answering a simultaneous equation question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are solving simultaneous equations and correctly solve for one variable, but then incorrectly assign that value to the other variable. This can happen when students are not careful with the variables and do not clearly label which variable they are solving for. For example, if the equations are x + y = 4 and x - y = 2, a student may correctly solve for x, but then write the value of x as the value of y.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- When the equations are symmetrical and the student is not careful to distinguish between the variables (e.g., x + y = 4 and x - y = 2).
- When the student uses substitution or elimination methods to solve the equations but does not clearly label which variable is being solved for.
- When the student rushes through the solution and does not double-check the assignment of values to variables.
- When the student is dealing with more complex equations with multiple variables (e.g., 2x + 3y = 7 and x - 2y = -3)."
1220,Does not include zero when counting over zero,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count objects or numbers that include zero as a starting point or a value within a set. Students may mistakenly start counting from 1, excluding zero as a valid value. This misconception can arise from the common practice of starting counts from 1 in everyday life, making it difficult for students to adjust to the idea of zero being a valid number in certain contexts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Counting the number of days of the week, starting from Sunday (day 0) to Saturday (day 6).
2. Number lines that include zero, where students are asked to count the number of units between two points, such as from -3 to 2.
3. When working with temperature scales, such as Celsius or Fahrenheit, where zero is a valid temperature reading.
4. Counting the number of items in a set that includes zero as a placeholder or a valid value, such as the number of people in a room where no one is present (0 people).
5. Graphs that include zero as a data point, where students are asked to count the number of data points or interpret the graph."
1221,Converts a decimal to a fraction by writing 1 over the digits of the decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a decimal to a fraction simply involves writing 1 as the numerator and the digits of the decimal as the denominator. For example, they may think that 0.5 can be written as 1/5, or 0.25 can be written as 1/25. This misunderstanding shows a lack of comprehension of the actual process of converting decimals to fractions, which involves understanding place value and equivalent ratios.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to convert a decimal to a fraction, such as converting 0.5 or 0.8 to a fraction.
- When students are working with real-world problems, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, and need to convert between decimal and fraction forms.
- When students are solving math problems that involve equivalent ratios, such as scaling up or down a recipe, and need to convert between decimal and fraction forms."
1222,Forgets the denominator in probability,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students calculate the probability of an event happening, but they only consider the number of favorable outcomes (the numerator) and forget to divide it by the total number of possible outcomes (the denominator). As a result, they end up with an incorrect probability value, often greater than 1.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When calculating the probability of drawing a specific card from a deck, a student might only consider the number of desired cards (e.g., 4 aces) without dividing by the total number of cards in the deck (e.g., 52).
- When determining the probability of rolling a specific number on a die, a student might only count the number of favorable outcomes (e.g., rolling a 6) without considering the total number of possible outcomes (e.g., 6 possible numbers on a fair die).
- When finding the probability of getting a certain color of marble from a bag, a student might only consider the number of marbles of that color without dividing by the total number of marbles in the bag."
1223,Uses numerators to convert fractions to ratio despite different denominators,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert fractions to ratios or compare the size of fractions, but they incorrectly assume that they can directly compare or convert the numerators without considering the denominators. They may believe that as long as the numerators are the same or in the same proportion, the ratios are equal, even if the denominators are different.

For example, when comparing 1/4 and 2/8, a student with this misconception may think that 1:2 is the correct ratio because the numerators are in that proportion, without realizing that the denominators are different and the fractions actually represent the same value (1/4 = 2/8).

Short cases when this misconception will occur:

- Comparing the size of fractions with different denominators (e.g., 1/4 vs 2/5).
- Converting fractions to ratios or proportions without considering the denominators (e.g., 3/4 = 2/3 because the numerators are close).
- Simplifying fractions by canceling out different factors in the numerator and denominator (e.g., 4/8 = 2/3 because the 4's cancel).
- Adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators without finding a common denominator (e.g., 1/4 + 1/6 = 2/4 because the numerators add up)."
1224,Does not understand the diagram given in the question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to interpret and comprehend the visual information presented in a diagram, leading to difficulties in understanding the problem and arriving at a solution. Students may mislabel or misinterpret the different parts of the diagram, fail to recognize the relationships between the various components, or have trouble visualizing the situation being represented.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- In geometry, students may have trouble identifying angles, sides, or other features in a diagram, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- In measurement problems, students may misread or misinterpret scales, leading to incorrect calculations of perimeter, area, or volume.
- In data and statistics, students may struggle to understand charts, graphs, or other visual representations of data, leading to incorrect interpretations or conclusions.
- In algebra, students may have trouble understanding the relationship between variables and the diagram, leading to incorrect equations or solutions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given a diagram of a triangle with labeled angles and sides, but they incorrectly identify the hypotenuse, leading to an incorrect calculation of the triangle's area.
- A student is shown a graph of a function, but they misinterpret the x and y axes, leading to incorrect conclusions about the function's behavior.
- A student is given a diagram of a 3D shape, but they struggle to visualize the shape and incorrectly calculate its volume.
- A student is presented with a chart showing data over time, but they misread the scale, leading to incorrect conclusions about trends or patterns in the data."
1225,Believes you don't need to numerically order the data before calculating the median,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the median of a set of data and they believe that it's not necessary to arrange the data in numerical order before finding the middle value. They may think that they can simply look at the data and identify the middle value without organizing it first. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations of the median, as the middle value of unorganized data is unlikely to be the actual median.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When dealing with a large dataset and assuming that the numbers are already ordered because they are listed in a table or spreadsheet.
- When working with a dataset that has a small range of values, and the student assumes that the order doesn't matter because the values are ""close enough"".
- When calculating the median of a dataset that has an even number of values, and the student incorrectly identifies the middle values without ordering the data first.
- When using real-life data that is not already organized, such as scores from a test or measurements from an experiment."
1226,Does not recognise the distributive property,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that the distributive property allows them to distribute a single value or operation across multiple values or operations. In the context of multiplication over addition or subtraction, students may not recognize that a single value can be multiplied to multiple values separately. 

For example, in the expression 2(3 + 4), students may not realize that the 2 can be distributed to both the 3 and the 4, resulting in 2*3 + 2*4. Instead, they might try to add 3 and 4 first and then multiply by 2, or they might become confused and arrive at an incorrect solution.

This misconception can manifest in various mathematical operations, including:

- Expanding expressions with brackets, e.g., 3(2x + 1)
- Multiplying fractions, e.g., 1/2 * (2/3 + 3/4)
- Solving equations with brackets, e.g., 2(x + 3) = 10

In each of these cases, recognizing the distributive property is essential to arriving at the correct solution. If students do not understand this property, they may struggle to simplify expressions, solve equations, or perform other mathematical operations accurately."
1227,Forgets that a number without an indice is to the power of 1 ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overlook the fact that any number or variable written without an exponent is assumed to have an exponent of 1. This means that when applying the laws of exponents, such as multiplying or dividing variables with the same base, students may fail to treat the number without an exponent as having an exponent of 1, leading to incorrect simplifications.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: When simplifying expressions like 2x * x, students may forget to treat the first 'x' as x^1, resulting in incorrect simplifications.
2. Exponent rules: When applying exponent rules like a^m * a^n = a^(m+n), students may not consider the case where one of the exponents is not explicitly written, e.g., 2x * x^2.
3. Solving equations: In equations involving variables with and without exponents, students may neglect to consider the implicit exponent of 1, leading to incorrect solutions.
4. Algebraic manipulations: When performing algebraic manipulations, such as expanding or factoring expressions, students may forget to account for the implicit exponent of 1, leading to errors."
1228,Believes sets are the same if the elements within them have a shared property,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that two sets are identical or equal simply because they share a common characteristic or property among their elements. They might overlook the fact that the sets may contain different elements or have different quantities of elements, focusing solely on the shared attribute. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly equate sets that are actually distinct.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When comparing sets of even numbers and multiples of 2, students might think they are the same set because both contain numbers that are divisible by 2, without realizing that 'even numbers' and 'multiples of 2' might be presented differently (e.g., as a list of elements) even though they are mathematically equivalent.
- Case 2: If students are given a set of animals that can fly and a set of birds, they may assume these sets are identical since both contain flying creatures, without considering that not all flying animals are birds (e.g., insects, bats).
- Case 3: In a scenario where students are given a set of numbers greater than 5 and a set of numbers greater than or equal to 6, they might mistakenly think these sets are the same because they both contain 'large' numbers, without recognizing that the first set includes the number 5.1 (or any other number greater than 5 but less than 6) while the second set does not."
1229,Confuses chord and circumference,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definitions and properties of a chord and the circumference of a circle. A chord is a line segment that connects two points on the circle, whereas the circumference is the distance around the circle. Students with this misconception may incorrectly use the terms interchangeably or believe that any line segment within the circle is the circumference. They may also struggle to identify the relationship between chords and the circle's center, leading to errors in problem-solving.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to label or identify parts of a circle, students may mistakenly label a chord as the circumference or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving circle geometry, such as calculating the area or circumference, students may incorrectly apply formulas or substitute chord lengths for circumference measurements.
- When constructing or drawing circles, students may draw a chord and mistakenly believe it represents the circle's circumference.
- When solving real-world problems involving circular shapes, such as calculating the distance around a circular track or the length of a chord in a bridge design, students may apply their misconception and arrive at incorrect solutions."
1230,Believes you cube the conversion factor when dealing with squared units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with conversion between different units, particularly when the units are squared (e.g., square meters to square centimeters). The students mistakenly believe that when converting between squared units, they need to cube the conversion factor instead of squaring it. This shows a lack of understanding of how unit conversions work, especially when dealing with area or volume measurements.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Converting the area of a room from square meters to square centimeters.
- Changing the unit of measurement for the area of a shape from square inches to square feet.
- Comparing the area of different objects when their measurements are given in different units (e.g., comparing the area of a book cover in square inches to the area of a poster in square feet).
- Solving problems involving scale drawings or maps where the scale is given in squared units (e.g., 1 square centimeter represents 100 square meters)."
1231,Does not know that 7 and -7 are different,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students do not fully comprehend the concept of negative numbers and their relationship to positive numbers. They may believe that the absolute value of a number (i.e., its distance from zero) is the only important aspect, and therefore, 7 and -7 are the same. This misconception can be due to a lack of understanding of the number line, where negative numbers are represented on the left side of zero and positive numbers on the right side.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing temperatures: A student might think that -7°C is the same as 7°C, not realizing that one is below freezing and the other is relatively mild.
- When working with money: A student might think that a debt of $7 is the same as having $7, not understanding that one is a loss and the other is a gain.
- When solving equations: A student might incorrectly simplify an equation by combining 7 and -7, thinking they cancel each other out, rather than understanding that they have different signs and therefore different effects on the equation.
- When graphing on a coordinate plane: A student might plot the points (7,0) and (-7,0) as the same point, not realizing that they are on opposite sides of the origin."
1232,"Thinks the longest bar has the highest frequency on a pictogram, even if the symbols aren't evenly spaced","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret pictograms, a type of graph that uses symbols or images to represent data. They mistakenly assume that the length of the bar or the number of symbols in a bar directly corresponds to the frequency of the data, without considering the scale or key provided. In a pictogram where symbols aren't evenly spaced or have different values, this can lead to incorrect conclusions. For example, if a pictogram uses one symbol to represent 5 units and another symbol to represent 10 units, a student with this misconception may think the longer bar or more symbols means the highest frequency, even if the actual data values are lower.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A pictogram showing favorite fruits in a class, where apples have 3 symbols (each symbol representing 2 students) and bananas have 2 symbols (each symbol representing 5 students). The student may think apples are more popular because the bar is longer.
- A pictogram displaying the number of books read by students, where each symbol represents a different number of books (e.g., one symbol for 5 books, another for 10 books). The student may incorrectly conclude that the student with the longest bar read the most books, without checking the key.
- A pictogram illustrating the number of pets owned by families, where each symbol represents a different type of pet and has a different value. The student may think the family with the most symbols has the most pets, without considering the values assigned to each symbol."
1233,"Believes that when eliminating a variable, if the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are the same, we add the equations.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to solve systems of linear equations using the method of elimination. They may mistakenly believe that when the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are the same, they should add the equations to eliminate the variable. However, this is not the correct approach. 

This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of elimination, where students think that adding the equations will ""cancel out"" the variable, without considering the actual arithmetic operations involved.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving a system of two linear equations with two variables, where the coefficients of one variable are the same but have the same sign.
- In word problems involving simultaneous equations, where the student is required to eliminate one variable to solve for the other.
- When working with linear equations with multiple variables, where the student needs to eliminate one or more variables to solve the system."
1234,Believes f(x + a) translates the function up a units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of the expression f(x + a) on the graph of a function. They incorrectly believe that adding 'a' to the input 'x' shifts the entire graph of the function upwards by 'a' units, rather than understanding that it actually shifts the graph to the left by 'a' units.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing functions, such as f(x) = x^2, and the student is asked to graph f(x + 2), they might incorrectly assume the graph shifts up 2 units instead of shifting left 2 units.
- When analyzing transformations of trigonometric functions, such as f(x) = sin(x), and the student is asked to graph f(x + π/2), they might mistakenly believe the graph shifts up π/2 units instead of shifting left π/2 units.
- When working with quadratic functions, such as f(x) = x^2 + 3x - 4, and the student is asked to find the graph of f(x + 1), they may incorrectly assume the graph shifts up 1 unit instead of shifting left 1 unit."
1235,"When completing the square in the form (x - a)^2 + b, believes b is the difference between a and the constant of the original quadratic","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to completing the square as a method to rewrite a quadratic expression in a perfect square form. They mistakenly believe that the constant term 'b' in the completed square form (x - a)^2 + b is simply the difference between 'a' (the number being subtracted from x) and the constant term in the original quadratic expression.

For example, given a quadratic expression x^2 + 4x + 7, students might incorrectly complete the square as (x + 2)^2 + 3, thinking that '3' is obtained by subtracting '2' (which is the value of 'a') from the constant term '7' in the original expression.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When the original quadratic expression has a constant term that is not a perfect square, like x^2 + 6x + 11.
- When the coefficient of x is not 1, like 2x^2 + 8x + 10.
- When the original quadratic expression has a negative coefficient of x, like x^2 - 4x + 9."
1236,Thinks the plan view is taken from an angle to include aspects of the side view and plan,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of plan views and how they are represented in 2D drawings. They may mistakenly believe that a plan view is drawn from an angle, incorporating elements from both the side view and the plan view. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the conventions used in technical drawing, where plan views are typically drawn as if looking directly down on an object from above.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to draw a plan view of a 3D object and they include features that would only be visible from the side.
- When students are interpreting a plan view and they mistakenly assume that certain features are visible from the side, rather than from directly above.
- When students are working with complex shapes or objects with multiple levels, and they struggle to visualize how the plan view would be represented.
- When students are using software or tools to create 2D drawings and they are unsure how to create a plan view that accurately represents the object from directly above."
1237,Believes that 1 part of a bar model will always have a value of 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of bar models, specifically the idea that each part of the bar model can represent different values. They mistakenly believe that one part of the bar model always represents the value of 1, rather than understanding that each part can represent a specific quantity or value, which can be any number depending on the context of the problem.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are introduced to bar models for the first time and are shown examples where one part of the bar model represents 1 unit.
- When solving problems involving fractions or ratios, students might assume that each part of the bar model represents 1, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In word problems where students need to divide or share quantities, they might assume that each part of the bar model can only represent a single unit.
- When working with scales or proportions, students might believe that each part of the bar model must be equal to 1, rather than understanding that the scale can vary."
1238,Does not realise the lines at an intersection have to be straight in order to show vertically opposite angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning about vertically opposite angles in geometry. They may understand that vertically opposite angles are equal, but they fail to recognize the importance of the lines being straight at the intersection point. As a result, they may incorrectly identify angles as vertically opposite even if the lines are curved or not intersecting at a single point. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when working with angles and shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When drawing or identifying angles in a diagram, students may incorrectly label curved lines or non-intersecting lines as vertically opposite angles.
* When solving problems involving angles, students may apply the concept of vertically opposite angles to situations where the lines are not straight, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When working with real-world examples, such as designing buildings or bridges, students may fail to recognize the importance of straight lines at intersections, leading to incorrect assumptions about the angles involved.
* When solving problems involving complex shapes, such as polygons or circles, students may incorrectly apply the concept of vertically opposite angles to curved or non-intersecting lines, leading to incorrect conclusions."
1239,Believes a cubic equation will have a quadratic graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to distinguish between the different types of polynomial equations and their corresponding graphs. They may think that all polynomial equations with a degree higher than 2 (quadratic) will have the same graph shape, which is not true. A cubic equation has a degree of 3 and its graph will have different characteristics compared to a quadratic equation. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Graphing a cubic function and expecting it to have a symmetrical U-shape, similar to a quadratic function.
- Case 2: Believing that a cubic equation will have only one turning point, like a quadratic equation, when in fact it can have up to two turning points.
- Case 3: Assuming that the methods used to solve quadratic equations can be directly applied to solve cubic equations, without realizing the need for different techniques, such as factoring, synthetic division, or Cardano's formula."
1240,Thinks the first term of a sequence must be 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the first term of any sequence, particularly arithmetic or geometric sequences, must always be 1. They might think this because many examples of sequences they have encountered start with 1, or because they associate the first term with the number one. As a result, when given a sequence or asked to create one, they might incorrectly assume the first term is always 1, rather than understanding that it can be any number.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to write the first few terms of a sequence given a specific rule, and they automatically start with 1.
- When students are given a sequence and asked to identify the pattern or rule, but they struggle because they expect the sequence to start with 1.
- When students are solving problems that involve finding the nth term of a sequence, and they incorrectly assume the first term is 1, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When students are creating their own sequences for a project or activity, and they default to starting with 1 without considering other possibilities."
1241,Subtracts instead of divides when division is written as a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with a division problem written in fractional form, such as 6 ÷ 2 written as 6/2. Instead of understanding that the line between the numbers represents division, they misinterpret it as a subtraction sign and subtract the numbers. For example, they may calculate 6 - 2 instead of dividing 6 by 2.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a word problem states ""Sarah has 12 cookies and she wants to share them equally among 4 friends"", and the problem is written as 12/4, the student may write 12 - 4 instead.
- When simplifying fractions, such as 8/2, the student may write 8 - 2 instead of dividing 8 by 2.
- When a math problem involves dividing a multi-digit number by a single-digit number, written in fractional form, such as 24/3, the student may subtract 3 from 24 instead of dividing."
1242,Does not recognise the similar shape as the shape has been rotated and the scale factor is less than 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify similar shapes due to a change in orientation (rotation) and a reduction in size (scale factor less than 1). They may believe that similar shapes must have the same orientation and/or be the same size or larger, rather than recognizing that similarity is preserved despite changes in size and orientation.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When comparing two shapes, one of which is a rotation of the other, but the rotated shape is also smaller (e.g., a triangle rotated 90 degrees and scaled down by a factor of 0.5).
- When identifying similar shapes in real-life objects, such as two different-sized car models with the same design but different orientations (e.g., one facing forward and the other facing sideways).
- When solving problems involving similarity and scaling, such as enlarging or reducing a shape while maintaining its proportions, but the student fails to recognize the similarity due to the change in size and orientation.
- When working with geometric transformations, such as rotations, reflections, and translations, and the student does not understand that these transformations preserve similarity."
1243,Believes when given a fraction and an amount the question must be to find the fraction of the amount. ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are overexposed to a specific type of problem involving fractions, where they are consistently asked to find a fraction of a given amount. As a result, they develop a fixed mindset that whenever they see a fraction and an amount in the same problem, the only possible question being asked is to find the fraction of that amount. They struggle to consider alternative questions or operations that may be required, such as finding the amount when given the fraction of it, comparing fractions, or finding equivalent fractions.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When given a word problem that involves a fraction and an amount, but the question is asking for something other than finding the fraction of the amount, e.g., ""Tom has 3/4 of a bag of apples. If the bag can hold 12 apples, how many apples does the bag contain in total?""
- When presented with a fraction and an amount in a mathematical expression or equation, but the operation required is not finding the fraction of the amount, e.g., 1/2 + 3 = ?
- When dealing with real-world applications that involve fractions and amounts, but the context requires a different operation or interpretation, e.g., measuring ingredients for a recipe, where the fraction represents a proportion of the total amount, rather than an amount to be found."
1244,The student does not understand the place value of 3-digit numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of hundreds, tens, and ones places in 3-digit numbers. They may have difficulty understanding that each digit in a 3-digit number has a specific place value, with the leftmost digit representing hundreds, the middle digit representing tens, and the rightmost digit representing ones.

For example, when given the number 247, a student with this misconception might not understand that:

- The '2' represents 200 (2 x 100)
- The '4' represents 40 (4 x 10)
- The '7' represents 7 (7 x 1)

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When asked to write a 3-digit number in expanded form (e.g., 247 as 200 + 40 + 7).
- When comparing or ordering 3-digit numbers (e.g., which is larger, 247 or 274?).
- When performing arithmetic operations with 3-digit numbers, such as addition or subtraction (e.g., 247 + 135).
- When rounding 3-digit numbers to the nearest ten or hundred (e.g., rounding 247 to the nearest ten)."
1245,Believes a number written in standard form with a negative power creates a larger number than that with a positive power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of standard form (also known as scientific notation) and the role of the exponent in determining the magnitude of a number. They may think that a negative power makes the number larger, possibly because they associate the negative sign with ""making the number go in the opposite direction"" and mistakenly assume this means it increases. 

For example, they might think that 3 × 10^(-4) is larger than 3 × 10^4. This misconception can lead to errors when comparing or ordering numbers written in standard form, or when performing calculations involving these numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing numbers in standard form: When comparing two numbers, one with a positive exponent and the other with a negative exponent, students may incorrectly conclude that the number with the negative exponent is larger.
- Ordering numbers in standard form: When ordering a set of numbers written in standard form, students may mistakenly place numbers with negative exponents above those with positive exponents.
- Performing calculations: When performing calculations involving numbers in standard form, such as multiplication or division, students may incorrectly assume that a negative exponent makes the number larger, leading to errors in their calculations."
1246,"When adding fractions, uses addition of the denominators as a common denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to add fractions, they can simply add the denominators together to create a common denominator. For instance, when adding 1/4 and 1/6, they might think that the common denominator is 4 + 6 = 10. They may then proceed to convert the fractions to have this denominator, resulting in incorrect calculations.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When adding fractions with different denominators in a mathematical problem, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6 or 2/3 + 3/5.
- In real-life scenarios, like combining ingredients for a recipe, e.g., adding 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/6 cup of honey.
- When solving word problems involving fractions, e.g., Tom has 1/4 of a pizza, and his friend has 1/6 of a pizza; how much pizza do they have in total?"
1247,Assumes you cannot use the fact that multiplication is commutative when simplifying an algebraic term. ,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that the commutative property of multiplication, which states that the order of the factors does not change the product (e.g., 2 × 3 = 3 × 2), does not apply when simplifying algebraic terms. This misconception may lead students to believe that they must always follow the exact order of the factors as written in the original expression, rather than rearranging them to simplify the term.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When simplifying an expression like 2 × x × 5, students may not recognize that they can rearrange the factors to get 2 × 5 × x, which simplifies to 10x.
* When working with an expression like x × 3 × 2, students may not realize that they can swap the order of the 3 and 2 to get x × 2 × 3, and then simplify to 6x.
* When simplifying an expression like (2x) × 5, students may not recognize that they can use the commutative property to rewrite it as 5 × (2x), and then simplify to 10x."
1248,Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (rounds too little),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand the importance of rounding numbers to the correct degree of accuracy. Rounding to the wrong degree of accuracy, specifically rounding too little, means that the student is not providing the required level of precision in their answer. For example, if a question asks for the answer to be rounded to two decimal places, a student with this misconception may round to the nearest whole number or to only one decimal place.

This misconception can arise from a lack of understanding of the concept of rounding and the importance of precision in mathematics. Students may also struggle with the rules of rounding, such as rounding up or down, and the use of significant figures.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting between units of measurement, such as converting meters to centimeters, and the student is asked to round the answer to a specific degree of accuracy.
- When performing calculations involving decimals, such as adding or subtracting decimal numbers, and the student is asked to round the answer to a specific number of decimal places.
- When solving problems involving percentages or ratios, and the student is asked to round the answer to a specific degree of accuracy.
- When working with data and statistics, such as calculating the mean or median of a set of data, and the student is asked to round the answer to a specific degree of accuracy."
1249,"Believes 'given that a, what is the probability of b?' means 'given that b, what is the probability of a?'","Explanation: This misconception is related to conditional probability, which is a fundamental concept in Data and Statistics. Students may misunderstand the concept of conditional probability and believe that the probability of event 'b' occurring given that event 'a' has occurred is the same as the probability of event 'a' occurring given that event 'b' has occurred. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the direction of the conditional relationship between the two events.

In other words, students may think that P(b|a) is equal to P(a|b), which is not necessarily true. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of conditional probabilities.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving problems involving conditional probabilities, such as medical diagnosis or insurance claims, where the direction of the conditional relationship is crucial.
- When analyzing data and trying to determine the probability of a certain outcome given some prior condition.
- When working with Bayes' theorem, which involves updating probabilities based on new information.
- When interpreting the results of statistical tests, such as hypothesis testing, where conditional probabilities play a key role.
- When solving problems involving cause-and-effect relationships, where the direction of the conditional relationship is important."
1250,Correct scale but wrong value on protractor reading.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of using a protractor to measure angles, but incorrectly read the value of the angle. They might correctly align the protractor with the angle, identify the correct scale (degrees, minutes, or seconds), but misinterpret the marking on the protractor. For example, they might mistake the inner scale for the outer scale, or vice versa, leading to an incorrect angle measurement.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When measuring acute angles (less than 90 degrees), students might confuse the inner and outer scales, leading to an incorrect reading.
* When measuring obtuse angles (greater than 90 degrees), students might miscount the degrees or mistake the supplementary angle (180 - angle) for the actual angle.
* When measuring angles in a diagram with multiple angles, students might mistakenly read the wrong angle or scale, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When working with reflex angles (greater than 180 degrees), students might become confused with the wrapping around of the protractor scale, leading to incorrect readings."
1251,"Correctly finds the reciprocal of a number, but believes it should be opposite in sign to the original number.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the concept of taking the reciprocal of a number, but mistakenly believe that the sign of the reciprocal should be opposite to the sign of the original number. For example, they may think that the reciprocal of 5 is -1/5, or the reciprocal of -3 is 1/3 with a positive sign.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the reciprocals of numbers in algebra, such as the reciprocal of x, students may write it as -1/x instead of 1/x.
- In graphing functions, students may mistakenly plot the reciprocal function with the wrong sign, leading to an incorrect graph.
- When solving equations involving fractions, students may incorrectly change the sign of the reciprocal, affecting the entire solution.
- In problems involving rates and ratios, students may calculate the reciprocal of a rate, but incorrectly change its sign, leading to incorrect conclusions."
1252,Doesn't know the area of a triangle formula,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to recall or apply the formula for calculating the area of a triangle, which is a fundamental concept in geometry. Students may struggle to remember the formula, or they may not fully understand the concept of area and how it relates to the base and height of a triangle. This can lead to difficulties in solving problems that involve finding the area of triangles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the area of a triangle given its base and height.
- When required to calculate the area of a triangle in a real-world context, such as finding the area of a triangular garden bed.
- When solving problems that involve comparing the areas of different triangles.
- When working with more complex shapes that can be broken down into triangles, such as finding the area of a polygon.
- When asked to apply the formula to find the area of a triangle in a different orientation, such as a right-angled triangle or an isosceles triangle."
1253,"Thinks 1 cubic metre = 100,000 cubic centimetres","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to convert between units of measurement for volume correctly. They may understand that 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, but they incorrectly apply this conversion to volume measurements. In the case of volume, students mistakenly assume that since 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, then 1 cubic meter (1m x 1m x 1m) would be equal to 100 x 100 x 100 = 1,000,000 cubic centimeters is incorrect and they wrote 100,000 cubic centimeters which is more wrong, but they forgot that 1 cubic meter indeed is 1,000,000 cubic centimeters (or 1,000 liters) but not 100,000 cubic centimeters.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:
- When students are asked to convert the volume of a container from cubic meters to cubic centimeters.
- When calculating the volume of a rectangular prism with sides given in meters and then converting it to cubic centimeters.
- When comparing the volumes of objects given in different units, such as cubic meters and cubic centimeters.
- When solving problems involving the volume of liquids or gases and needing to convert between units."
1254,"Believes that if there are two unknowns in an equation, all integers must be possible solutions","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to linear equations with two variables, and they mistakenly believe that because there are multiple unknowns, any integer value can be a solution. They may think that the presence of two variables means that there are infinite possibilities and any integer can satisfy the equation. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that with one variable, there is usually a single solution, and students may assume that with two variables, all values are valid.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When solving linear equations like 2x + 3y = 5, students might believe that any integer value of x and y will satisfy the equation.
* In a system of linear equations, students may assume that any integer solution to one equation will automatically satisfy the other equation.
* When graphing linear equations on a coordinate plane, students may believe that any point with integer coordinates is a solution to the equation.
* When solving problems involving simultaneous equations, students may incorrectly assume that all integer values of the variables are possible solutions, rather than looking for specific values that satisfy both equations."
1255,Adds rather than multiplies for combined probabilities,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add the probabilities of individual events to find the probability of both events happening together, instead of multiplying them. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of combined probabilities, where the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other event. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the probability of two or more independent events happening together (e.g., rolling two sixes on two separate dice).
- When solving problems involving conditional probabilities (e.g., drawing two red cards from a deck without replacement).
- When calculating the probability of combined events with multiple outcomes (e.g., flipping two coins and getting heads on both).
- When solving problems involving the probability of consecutive events (e.g., rolling a certain number on a die and then drawing a specific card from a deck)."
1256,Believes the difference of 2 squares method of factorising also works for the addition of 2 squares,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rule for difference of squares to the sum of squares. They may incorrectly believe that just as a² - b² can be factored as (a - b)(a + b), a² + b² can also be factored in a similar way. However, the addition of two squares does not factor into the product of two binomials in the same manner as the difference of squares.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly factor expressions like x² + 4, 9 + y², or 4x² + 9, among others, by attempting to apply the difference of squares formula.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Factorizing the expression x² + 4
- Simplifying the expression 9 + y²
- Factoring the quadratic equation 4x² + 9
- Solving an equation of the form a² + b² = c²
- Manipulating algebraic expressions involving the sum of squares."
1257,Assumes a 1/4 of a whole is 25,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of fractions, specifically quarters, and associate it with the number 25, rather than understanding that a quarter represents one out of four equal parts of a whole. This can occur when students are not fully grasping the idea of equivalent ratios and proportions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing fractions to percentages, students might assume 1/4 is equal to 25, without realizing that 25 is actually a percentage representation of a quarter (25% = 25/100), and not the actual value of the fraction.
- In real-life scenarios, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, students might mistakenly use 25 units instead of one-quarter of the required amount.
- When working with geometric shapes, students might incorrectly label a quarter of a shape as ""25"" instead of ""1/4"" or its equivalent ratio.
- In data analysis, students might misinterpret data represented in quarters, thinking it represents the number 25, rather than one-fourth of the total data."
1258,"When calculating a scale factor, thinks they need to subtract rather than divide.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the scale factor between two similar shapes or objects. They may believe that to find the scale factor, they need to subtract the measurements of the smaller shape from the larger shape, rather than dividing the measurements of the larger shape by the smaller shape. For example, if a student is given two similar rectangles with lengths of 6cm and 12cm, they may think that the scale factor is 12 - 6 = 6, rather than 12 ÷ 6 = 2.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the perimeters of two similar shapes, students may try to find the difference between the perimeters rather than dividing the larger perimeter by the smaller one.
- When enlarging or reducing a shape, students may subtract the scale factor from the original measurements instead of multiplying or dividing by the scale factor.
- When solving problems involving proportional relationships, students may use subtraction instead of division to find the constant of proportionality or the scale factor.
- When comparing the areas or volumes of similar shapes, students may apply subtraction instead of using the correct formula involving the square or cube of the scale factor."
1259,Believes division is sometimes commutative ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the order of numbers in a division operation does not affect the result. In other words, they think that dividing a by b is the same as dividing b by a. This misconception may stem from their understanding of addition and multiplication, which are commutative operations where the order of numbers does not change the result.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing two different numbers, students might write 12 ÷ 4 = 4 ÷ 12, thinking that both expressions are equal.
- When solving word problems involving division, students might reverse the dividend and divisor, leading to incorrect answers. For example, ""If Sara has 18 cookies and she wants to package them in bags of 3, how many bags can she make?"" They might write 3 ÷ 18 instead of 18 ÷ 3.
- When working with fractions, students might mistakenly simplify fractions by dividing the denominator by the numerator instead of the other way around. For example, they might simplify 3/12 as 12 ÷ 3 = 4, instead of 3 ÷ 12."
1260,Gives number of sections of pie chart rather than the amount it represents,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students interpret a pie chart by counting the number of sections or slices instead of considering the proportion or percentage of the whole that each section represents. They may mistakenly believe that the number of sections is the most important information, rather than understanding that each section represents a specific quantity or percentage of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to analyze a pie chart showing the distribution of favorite colors in a class, with 5 sections labeled as red, blue, green, yellow, and purple. Instead of recognizing that the largest section represents 40% of the class, they simply state that there are 5 colors.
- A student is given a pie chart illustrating the breakdown of expenses for a school event, with 3 sections labeled as food, decorations, and entertainment. They incorrectly conclude that the event has 3 main expenses, without considering the actual proportions of the budget allocated to each category.
- A student is asked to create a pie chart to represent the number of hours spent on different activities in a day. They divide the chart into 6 equal sections, one for each activity, without considering the actual time spent on each activity, leading to an inaccurate representation of the data."
1261,Thinks if you multiply a fraction by itself you get a whole,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions. They may believe that multiplying a fraction by itself will result in a whole number, possibly due to an incomplete understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the multiplication of fractions. This misconception may stem from the fact that when you multiply a whole number by itself, the result is always a whole number (e.g., 2 x 2 = 4), and students may incorrectly apply this rule to fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying 1/2 by 1/2: A student might think that (1/2) x (1/2) = 1, instead of the correct answer, which is 1/4.
- Squaring 3/4: A student might believe that (3/4) x (3/4) = 1, instead of the correct answer, which is 9/16.
- Multiplying 2/3 by 2/3: A student might think that (2/3) x (2/3) = 1, instead of the correct answer, which is 4/9."
1262,"Believes that they can fully factorise an expression by taking out any common factor, not just the HCF","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of factorization, but they misunderstand the importance of identifying the Highest Common Factor (HCF) or Greatest Common Factor (GCF) of the terms in an expression. They believe that taking out any common factor, not necessarily the highest one, is sufficient to fully factorise the expression. This leads to incomplete or incorrect factorization.

For example, when given an expression like 12x + 8, students with this misconception might factor out a 2, resulting in 2(6x + 4), but fail to recognize that 4 is the HCF, leading to the correct factorization: 4(3x + 2).

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Factorizing expressions like 18x + 12, where students might take out a 2 or 3 instead of the HCF, which is 6.
- Simplifying expressions like 24x + 16, where students might factor out a 2 or 4 instead of the HCF, which is 8.
- Factorizing quadratic expressions like 6x^2 + 12x, where students might take out a 2 or 3 instead of the HCF, which is 6."
1263,Does not understand the definition of a rational number when it is a surd,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to comprehend that rational numbers can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, but they incorrectly assume that all numbers expressed with a radical sign (√) are irrational. In the case of surds, students may struggle to recognize that some surds can be simplified to rational numbers, such as √16 = 4, which is a rational number. They may also have difficulty understanding that rational numbers can be expressed as a finite decimal or a ratio of integers, and that surds do not always result in irrational numbers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying surds, such as √9 or √25, where the result is a rational number.
- Identifying whether a number expressed with a radical sign is rational or irrational, such as √2 versus √4.
- Comparing and ordering rational and irrational numbers, including those expressed as surds.
- Solving equations involving surds and rational numbers, where students need to recognize and manipulate rational numbers in surd form."
1264,Finds the median instead of the mode,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the most frequently occurring value in a dataset (the mode), but instead, they find the middle value of the dataset when it is arranged in order (the median). This may be due to a lack of understanding of the definitions of mode and median, or because students are more familiar with finding the median. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When given a dataset with an odd number of values and asked to find the value that appears most often, a student may find the middle value and assume it is the mode.
- When a dataset has multiple modes, students may find the median and assume it is the mode because they do not know how to handle multiple modes.
- When given a dataset with a clear outlier, a student may arrange the data in order and find the median, assuming it is the mode, instead of looking for the most frequently occurring value.
- When asked to describe a dataset that has a clear mode but a different median, students may incorrectly state the median as the mode because they are more comfortable finding the median."
1265,"When describing a translation, goes from the image to the original","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that a translation is described by moving from the translated image (the new position) back to the original object (the initial position), rather than the other way around. In other words, they think that the translation vector points from the image to the original object, instead of from the original object to the image.

This misconception can lead students to describe translations incorrectly, which can cause confusion and errors when working with geometric transformations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When describing the translation of a shape on a coordinate grid, a student might say ""the shape moved 3 units to the left and 2 units down from the new position to the original position"" instead of ""the shape moved 3 units to the right and 2 units up from the original position to the new position"".
* When solving a problem involving translations, a student might draw the translation vector pointing from the image to the original object, rather than from the original object to the image.
* When asked to describe a translation in words, a student might say ""the object was moved from its new position back to its original position"" instead of ""the object was moved from its original position to its new position""."
1266,"When solving simultaneous equations, thinks they can ignore one of the variables","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations, which involve two or more equations with two or more variables. Some students may believe that they can simply ignore one of the variables and solve the equations as if they were ordinary linear equations with one variable. They may think that the other variable will somehow magically cancel out or become irrelevant. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of simultaneous equations and how they work.

This misconception can manifest in different ways, such as:

* When given two equations, such as 2x + 3y = 7 and x - 2y = -3, the student may try to solve for x by ignoring the y variable and treating the equations as two separate linear equations.
* When asked to solve a system of equations using substitution or elimination methods, the student may attempt to eliminate one variable by ignoring it altogether, rather than using the correct algebraic manipulations.
* When faced with a word problem that requires solving simultaneous equations, the student may focus on one variable and neglect the other, leading to an incomplete or incorrect solution.

In each of these cases, the student is demonstrating a fundamental misunderstanding of how simultaneous equations work and how to solve them."
1267,Identifies a number as a common factor but doesn't identify a letter as a common factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify common factors in expressions, particularly those that involve both numbers and variables. Students may correctly recognize that a number can be factored out as a common factor, but they fail to apply the same logic when a variable (represented by a letter) is the common factor. This indicates a lack of understanding that variables can also be treated as factors in algebraic expressions, just like numbers.

For example, in the following cases, students might exhibit this misconception:

- Case 1: When given an expression like 4x + 8, students might correctly identify 4 as a common factor, but when given an expression like x^2 + 3x, they might not recognize x as a common factor.
- Case 2: In an expression like 6y + 12, students may identify 6 as a common factor but fail to see y as a common factor in an expression like y^2 + 2y.
- Case 3: When simplifying expressions, students might not apply the rule of factoring out a common letter, such as in xy + xz, where x is the common factor."
1268,"When solving simultaneous equations, thinks you only transform the algebraic terms, rather than the whole equation.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations using methods such as substitution or elimination. They may believe that only the terms containing variables (algebraic terms) need to be manipulated, ignoring the constant terms or any other elements of the equation. This can lead to incorrect transformations and ultimately, incorrect solutions.

For example, given the simultaneous equations:

2x + 3y = 5
x + 2y = 3

A student with this misconception may attempt to eliminate the x-term by multiplying the second equation by -2 and only transforming the x-term, without multiplying the constant term, resulting in:

-2x - 4y = -6 (correct transformation of x-term, but incorrect transformation of constant term)

However, the correct transformation would be:

-2x - 4y = -6 (correct transformation of entire equation)

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When using the elimination method to solve simultaneous equations.
* When substituting an expression from one equation into another equation.
* When solving simultaneous equations with more than two variables.
* When dealing with equations that have constants or coefficients on both sides of the equation.
* When solving word problems that involve simultaneous equations, where the equations may be more complex or involve multiple steps."
1269,Confuses left and right,"Explanation: This misconception involves students having difficulty distinguishing between left and right directions or positions. It can be a spatial awareness issue, where students struggle to understand the relative positions of objects or themselves in relation to other objects. This can lead to confusion in various mathematical concepts, such as geometry, measurement, and even data analysis where graphs or charts are involved.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When describing the position of a shape or object in a geometric diagram, a student may incorrectly identify a left or right turn.
- When following instructions for measuring lengths or angles, a student may confuse left and right, leading to incorrect measurements.
- In coordinate geometry, a student may struggle to plot points correctly on the x-axis, confusing left (negative) and right (positive) directions.
- When analyzing data in a graph, a student may misinterpret the left or right shift of a graph, affecting their understanding of the data.
- In real-life applications, such as navigation or giving directions, students may confuse left and right, leading to incorrect instructions or navigation."
1270,Divides by 10 instead of 100 when converting a percentage to a decimal ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting percentages to decimals, but they incorrectly divide the percentage value by 10 instead of 100. This indicates a misunderstanding of the relationship between percentages and decimals, specifically the fact that the word ""percent"" means ""per hundred"" and therefore requires division by 100 to convert to a decimal.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting a percentage to a decimal in a straightforward problem, such as converting 25% to a decimal. The student may incorrectly divide 25 by 10 to get 2.5, instead of dividing by 100 to get 0.25.
- When solving real-world problems involving percentages, such as calculating the decimal equivalent of a percentage discount on a product's price. For example, if a shirt is on sale for 15% off, the student may incorrectly divide 15 by 10 to get 1.5, instead of dividing by 100 to get 0.15.
- When working with word problems that involve percentage changes, such as ""A bakery increased its sales by 20% from last year. What is the decimal equivalent of this increase?"" The student may incorrectly divide 20 by 10 to get 2, instead of dividing by 100 to get 0.20."
1271,Confuses chord and radius,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty distinguishing between a chord and a radius in a circle. A chord is a line segment that connects two points on the circumference of a circle, while a radius is a line segment that connects the center of the circle to a point on its circumference. Students may mistakenly identify a chord as a radius or vice versa, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the definitions or visual representations of these concepts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When identifying parts of a circle, students may incorrectly label a chord as a radius or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving circle geometry, students may use the length of a chord as if it were the radius, or vice versa, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When drawing diagrams of circles, students may draw a chord and mistakenly label it as a radius, or draw a radius and mistakenly label it as a chord.
- When solving problems involving circle theorems, such as the intersecting chord theorem, students may apply the theorem incorrectly due to their misunderstanding of chords and radii."
1272,Gives a rounded whole number instead of a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to perform calculations that result in decimal answers, but they provide a rounded whole number instead. This could be due to a lack of understanding of decimal places, a tendency to simplify answers, or an assumption that whole numbers are more ""correct"" or ""easier"" to work with.

This misconception can manifest in various math topics, including:

- Calculations involving money (e.g., finding the total cost of items priced at £2.50 each)
- Measurements (e.g., recording the length of an object as 5 cm instead of 4.8 cm)
- Division operations (e.g., dividing 10 by 3 and answering 3 instead of 3.33)
- Conversions between units (e.g., converting 250g to kilograms and answering 0 instead of 0.25 kg)

Some short cases when this misconception may occur include:

- Q: A book costs £4.99. If you buy 3 books, how much will you pay in total?
A: £15 (instead of £14.97)
- Q: A water bottle can hold 0.75 liters of water. If you have 2 bottles, how many liters of water can you hold in total?
A: 1 liter (instead of 1.5 liters)
- Q: A pencil is 15.2 cm long. What is its length to the nearest tenth of a centimeter?
A: 15 cm (instead of 15.2 cm)"
1273,Thinks they start on the left when doing long multiplication ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of long multiplication. They may mistakenly believe that the multiplication process starts from the leftmost digit of the multiplicand (the number being multiplied), rather than the rightmost digit. This can lead to incorrect placement of the partial products and ultimately result in an incorrect final answer.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Multiplying multi-digit numbers, e.g., 43 × 27
* Multiplying numbers with zeros, e.g., 400 × 25
* Multiplying numbers with different numbers of digits, e.g., 45 × 213
* Solving real-world problems that involve multiplication, e.g., calculating the area of a room or the cost of items."
1274,Subtracts simultaneous equations when addition is required,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are solving simultaneous equations and they need to eliminate one variable to find the value of the other variable. Instead of adding the equations to eliminate the variable, they subtract one equation from the other, which leads to an incorrect solution. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of elimination and how to apply it correctly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When solving simultaneous equations with two variables, such as 2x + 3y = 7 and x + 2y = 4, students may subtract the second equation from the first equation, resulting in an incorrect solution.
* When dealing with equations that have the same coefficient for one variable but different signs, such as x + 2y = 5 and x - 2y = -3, students may subtract the equations instead of adding them, leading to an incorrect solution.
* When solving word problems that involve simultaneous equations, such as finding the cost of two items given their total cost and the difference in their prices, students may apply the subtraction method incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect answer."
1275,Does not relate integers and fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students view integers and fractions as separate entities, failing to recognize that integers can be represented as fractions and vice versa. They may struggle to understand that fractions can represent whole numbers, and that integers can be expressed as fractions with a denominator of 1. This misconception can lead to difficulties in comparing, adding, and subtracting fractions and integers, as well as solving equations involving both.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the value of an integer and a fraction (e.g., comparing 2 and 4/2).
- When adding or subtracting fractions and integers (e.g., 3 + 1/2).
- When solving equations involving both integers and fractions (e.g., 2x + 3/4 = 5).
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions (e.g., 3 1/2 to 7/2).
- When simplifying fractions to their simplest form (e.g., simplifying 4/4 to 1)."
1276,"Believes that the y intercept is (0, y) where y is any y coordinate on the line","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the y-intercept in a linear equation. They believe that any point on the line with an x-coordinate of 0 is the y-intercept, regardless of the actual equation of the line. In other words, they think that as long as the x-coordinate is 0, the corresponding y-coordinate is the y-intercept.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing a line, a student may choose any point on the line with an x-coordinate of 0 and label it as the y-intercept, without realizing that the y-intercept is a specific point where the line crosses the y-axis.
- When given the equation of a line, such as y = 2x + 3, a student may think that any point on the line with an x-coordinate of 0, such as (0, 5), is the y-intercept, rather than finding the actual y-intercept by substituting x = 0 into the equation (in this case, the y-intercept would be (0, 3)).
- When working with multiple lines on a graph, a student may become confused and identify the y-intercept as any point where the lines intersect the y-axis, rather than identifying the specific point where each individual line crosses the y-axis."
1277,"In algebra, thinks it's ok to write (for example) 0x rather than just 0","Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that including the variable (in this case, x) is always necessary in an algebraic expression, even when the coefficient is zero. They may think that writing 0x is a way of showing that the variable is present, but has a coefficient of zero. This misconception can lead students to write unnecessary terms in their algebraic expressions, which can make their work appear cluttered and may even lead to errors in simplification.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, students may write 0x + 3x as 0x + 3x, instead of just 3x.
- When solving linear equations, students may write the solution as 0x = 0, instead of just 0.
- When graphing linear equations, students may label a point on the graph as (0, 0x) instead of just (0, 0).
- When expanding algebraic expressions, students may include terms with zero coefficients, such as 0x^2, instead of omitting them.
- When comparing algebraic expressions, students may believe that 0x is not equal to 0, leading to confusion and incorrect conclusions."
1278,Believes the subscript in iteration notation is the value to be substituted,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the purpose of the subscript in iteration notation. In iteration notation, subscripts are used to denote the number of times a function or operation is applied, but some students may mistakenly believe that the subscript represents the value to be substituted into the function. For example, in the expression f₃(x), students with this misconception might think that the ""3"" in the subscript means they need to substitute x with 3, rather than understanding that it represents the third iteration of the function f.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When working with sequences and series, where students might think that the subscript indicates the value of the term rather than its position in the sequence.
- In the study of iterative functions, where students may confuse the subscript with the input value for the function.
- When dealing with recursive formulas, where students may misinterpret the subscript as the value to be used in the recursive formula rather than the iteration number."
1279,Confuses right angle triangles and equilateral triangles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the properties of right-angled triangles and equilateral triangles. They may believe that all triangles with equal sides (equilateral) must have a right angle (90 degrees), or vice versa, that all right-angled triangles have equal sides. This confusion can lead to incorrect assumptions about the relationships between the sides and angles of these triangles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to draw or identify a right-angled triangle, students might consistently draw equilateral triangles, assuming the equal sides are a requirement for a right angle.
- When solving problems involving the Pythagorean theorem, students may attempt to apply it to equilateral triangles, which do not necessarily have right angles.
- When given a triangle with two equal sides, students may incorrectly assume that the triangle must be right-angled, or that the angles must be 60 degrees each.
- When classifying triangles based on their properties, students may incorrectly group right-angled triangles and equilateral triangles together, failing to recognize their distinct characteristics."
1280,"When multiplying fractions, multiplies the numerator and adds the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the operation of multiplying fractions. They may recall the procedure for adding fractions, which involves having a common denominator, and incorrectly apply this concept to multiplying fractions. As a result, they mistakenly add the denominators instead of multiplying them. 

This misconception can also stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the effect of multiplying fractions on the size of the resulting fraction. Students may not fully grasp that multiplying fractions involves finding a part of a part, which requires multiplying both the numerators and denominators.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Multiplying two simple fractions: 1/2 × 1/3 = ? (Incorrect answer: 1 × 1 / 2 + 3 = 1/5)
2. Multiplying fractions with different denominators: 2/3 × 3/4 = ? (Incorrect answer: 2 × 3 / 3 + 4 = 6/7)
3. Multiplying mixed numbers: 2 1/2 × 3 1/3 = ? (Incorrect answer: converting to improper fractions and then incorrectly multiplying)"
1281,Does not understand that similar shapes and enlarged shapes will have the same size angles as the original,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that similar shapes, including enlarged shapes, maintain the same angle measurements as the original shape. They might believe that if a shape is enlarged or transformed into a similar shape, the angles will also increase or change. This misconception can be attributed to the idea that students may associate the size of the shape with the size of its angles, thinking that larger shapes should have larger angles.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When students are asked to identify corresponding angles in similar triangles, they might incorrectly assume that the angles in the larger triangle are greater than those in the smaller triangle.
* When students are working with scale drawings or enlargements, they may incorrectly calculate the new angle measurements, thinking that they should be larger or different from the original angles.
* When comparing similar shapes, students may focus on the changes in side lengths or perimeters and mistakenly assume that the angles have also changed.
* When solving problems involving similar shapes in real-world contexts, such as architecture or design, students may apply this misconception and arrive at incorrect conclusions about the angles in the enlarged or similar shapes."
1282,When subtracting a negative thinks the answer must be negative ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to negative numbers and they have to perform subtraction operations involving these numbers. They may think that subtracting a negative number will always result in a negative answer, possibly because they are used to the idea that subtraction always ""takes away"" something. They might also be confusing the concept of subtracting a negative number with the idea of subtracting a positive number, which can indeed result in a negative answer if the number being subtracted is larger.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Subtracting a negative number from a positive number, e.g., 5 - (-3)
- Subtracting a negative number from another negative number, e.g., -5 - (-3)
- Solving algebraic expressions involving negative numbers, e.g., x - (-2)
- Dealing with word problems that involve temperatures, debts, or other real-world scenarios where negative numbers are used."
1283,Believes a polygon can have curved sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of a polygon. They may think that as long as a shape is closed, it can be considered a polygon, regardless of the nature of its sides. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify shapes with curved sides, such as circles or ellipses with a part cut out, as polygons. They may also mistakenly believe that a shape with a mix of straight and curved sides can be classified as a polygon.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to identify and classify different types of shapes, and they incorrectly label a shape with curved sides as a polygon.
- When students are drawing or creating their own shapes, and they include curved sides, thinking that they are still drawing a polygon.
- When students are solving problems involving perimeter or area of polygons, and they attempt to apply polygon formulas to shapes with curved sides.
- When students are working with real-world examples, such as designing a garden bed or a building layout, and they incorrectly assume that a curved boundary can be treated as a polygon."
1284,Thinks only like terms can be multiplied,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the rule for adding or subtracting like terms (i.e., terms with the same variable and exponent) also applies to multiplication. They may think that only terms with the same variable and exponent can be multiplied together. This misconception can lead to difficulties when students are faced with multiplying terms that have different variables or exponents.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying two binomials with different variables, such as (x + 2) and (y + 3).
- When multiplying a monomial with a binomial that has a different variable, such as 3x and (y + 2).
- When multiplying two monomials with different exponents, such as x^2 and x^3.
- When multiplying polynomials with multiple terms, such as (x^2 + 2x + 1) and (x + 2)."
1285,Believes a vertical line has equation y=,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a vertical line is represented by the equation y = a fixed value, but they fail to recognize that the x-coordinate is the variable that is constant in a vertical line, and hence, they may write the equation of a vertical line as y = a number. They do not realize that the equation of a vertical line should not be in the form y = a number, but rather x = a number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- When students are asked to find the equation of a vertical line passing through a given point.
- When students are given a graph with a vertical line and asked to write its equation.
- When students are solving a problem that involves finding the intersection point of a vertical line and another line or curve."
1286,believes the complement of a set consists of anything that is not just in that set,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the complement of a set. They believe that the complement of a set includes anything that is not only in the original set but also things that are unrelated or outside the universal set. In other words, they think the complement is everything in the universe except for the elements in the original set, without considering the context or the universal set.

For example:

- When finding the complement of a set A = {1, 2, 3} in the context of a universal set U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, a student with this misconception might say the complement of A includes not only 4 and 5 but also other unrelated elements like animals, colors, or even fictional characters.
- In a scenario where a set B = {apples, bananas} and the universal set U = {apples, bananas, oranges}, the student might claim the complement of B includes oranges, but also other unrelated things like cars, buildings, or countries.
- When dealing with a set C = {students in a particular class} and the universal set U = {all students in the school}, the student might think the complement of C includes not only students from other classes but also teachers, staff, parents, or even people outside the school."
1287,Believes if you changed all values by the same proportion the range would not change,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that if they multiply or divide all values in a dataset by the same constant, the range of the dataset remains unchanged. They might think that since the relative positions of the data points are preserved, the range, which is the difference between the largest and smallest values, would also remain the same.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Case 1: When scaling up or down a set of measurements. For example, if a set of exam scores is multiplied by 2, a student with this misconception might think the range of scores remains the same.
- Case 2: When converting between units. For instance, if a set of lengths is converted from meters to centimeters by multiplying by 100, the student might assume the range of lengths in centimeters is the same as it was in meters.
- Case 3: When performing percentage changes. If a set of prices is increased by 20%, a student with this misconception might believe the range of prices remains unchanged."
1288,Believes the intersection on a Venn diagram represents the total of one set,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a Venn diagram, specifically the intersection of two or more sets. They incorrectly believe that the intersection represents the total number of elements in one of the sets, rather than understanding that it represents the common elements shared between the sets. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when working with set operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to find the total number of elements in a set, students may incorrectly include the intersection as part of the total, rather than counting it separately.
2. When working with overlapping sets, students may mistakenly assume that the intersection is part of only one set, rather than recognizing it as a shared subset.
3. When solving problems involving set operations, such as union and intersection, students may incorrectly apply the operations due to their misunderstanding of the intersection.
4. When interpreting Venn diagrams, students may mislabel or misinterpret the intersection, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between the sets.
5. When comparing sets, students may incorrectly compare the intersection to the total number of elements in one set, rather than comparing the sets as a whole."
1289,Does not understand that the area of an enlarged shape is the area of the original multiplied by the square of the scale factor of the lengths.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that when a shape is enlarged by a certain scale factor, its area does not increase by the same scale factor, but rather by the square of that factor. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly calculate the area of the enlarged shape by simply multiplying the original area by the scale factor, rather than squaring the scale factor first.

For example, if a rectangle with an area of 12 square units is enlarged by a scale factor of 3, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the new area as 12 x 3 = 36 square units, instead of the correct calculation of 12 x 3^2 = 12 x 9 = 108 square units.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When calculating the area of a scaled-up drawing or model, students may apply the scale factor only once, resulting in an incorrect area.
- When solving problems involving similar figures, students may not account for the squared scale factor, leading to incorrect calculations of area and perimeter ratios.
- In real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, students may misestimate the area of enlarged structures or components, potentially leading to costly errors."
1290,Reads the wrong scale on the protractor when measuring reflex angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to measure reflex angles using a protractor. A reflex angle is an angle greater than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees. When measuring reflex angles, students need to use the outer scale on the protractor, which is often marked in the opposite direction to the inner scale. However, some students may incorrectly read the inner scale, which is typically used for acute and obtuse angles, resulting in an incorrect measurement.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When measuring the angle between two intersecting lines that form a reflex angle, a student might read the inner scale and obtain an acute angle measurement instead of the correct reflex angle measurement.
- When calculating the size of a reflex angle in a polygon, a student may use the inner scale and get a measurement that is less than 180 degrees, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.
- In geometry and trigonometry problems, students may be asked to find the measure of a reflex angle in a diagram. If they read the wrong scale on the protractor, they will arrive at an incorrect answer, which can affect their subsequent calculations and problem-solving."
1291,"Thinks they solve mx + c = a, by substituting in the value of a for x and therefore calculating ma + c","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of solving linear equations. They mistakenly believe that to solve for x in the equation mx + c = a, they can simply substitute the value of a for x, resulting in ma + c. This shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the variables and constants in the equation, as well as the purpose of solving for x.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When solving a simple linear equation like 2x + 3 = 5, the student might substitute 5 for x, resulting in 2(5) + 3, which is incorrect.
- When solving a linear equation with a negative coefficient, such as -x + 2 = 3, the student might substitute 3 for x, resulting in -(3) + 2, which is also incorrect.
- When solving a linear equation with a decimal or fractional coefficient, such as 0.5x + 1 = 2, the student might substitute 2 for x, resulting in 0.5(2) + 1, which is incorrect.
- When solving a word problem that involves a linear equation, such as ""Tom has 5 more than twice the number of pencils as his friend Alex. If Tom has 11 pencils, how many pencils does Alex have?"", the student might substitute 11 for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11, resulting in 2(11) + 5, which is incorrect."
1292,Does not realise that the area of a triangle is half the area of the contatining rectangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental concept that the area of a triangle is calculated as half the product of its base and height. They may incorrectly assume that the area of a triangle is the same as the area of the rectangle that contains it, or simply multiply the base and height without dividing by 2.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a right-angled triangle, students might multiply the two shorter sides (base and height) and forget to divide the result by 2.
- When comparing the areas of a triangle and its containing rectangle, students might incorrectly conclude that they have the same area, failing to account for the empty space within the rectangle that is not part of the triangle.
- When solving problems that involve decomposing shapes into triangles and rectangles, students might incorrectly calculate the total area by adding the areas of the triangles without halving them.
- When finding the area of a triangle with a given base and height, students might only consider the length of the base and height without recognizing the need to divide the product by 2 to get the correct area."
1293,Identifies how much repeated use of the term-to-term rule changes a number but does not apply to the sequence,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of a term-to-term rule in a sequence but fail to apply it to generate the next terms. They may be able to identify the pattern or rule, such as ""add 2"" or ""multiply by 3"", but struggle to use it consistently to generate subsequent terms.

For example, given the sequence 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., a student with this misconception may recognize that the rule is ""add 2"" but when asked to generate the next 3 terms, they may write 10, 12, 15, instead of the correct 10, 12, 14.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When generating a sequence using a simple addition or subtraction rule (e.g., 3, 5, 7, 9, ...).
- When using a multiplication or division rule to generate a sequence (e.g., 2, 4, 8, 16, ...).
- When working with sequences that have a combination of operations (e.g., 2, 5, 8, 11, ...).
- When asked to generate a sequence from a real-world context, such as the number of legs on a growing number of animals.
- When filling in missing terms in a sequence (e.g., 2, 4, __, 8, 10, ...)."
1294,"When solving an equation where there is a negative sign in front of the variable and its equivalent value, assumes the variable has a negative value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with an equation where a negative sign precedes the variable, for example, -x = -5. They mistakenly believe that the variable itself (x) is negative, simply because of the negative sign in front of it. They fail to recognize that the negative sign is actually being used to indicate the opposite or inverse of the variable's value, rather than defining the variable's value as negative.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly solve equations and make incorrect assumptions about the variable's value.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* Solving simple linear equations: -x = -3, students may think x is a negative number.
* Rearranging formulas: -2x = -10, students may assume x is a negative value.
* Working with inequalities: -x > -2, students may believe x is a negative value.
* Interpreting graphs: When a graph shows a negative value for a variable, students may assume the variable itself is negative, rather than considering the context of the graph."
1295,"When finding part of the area of a shape, subtracts from the side length before multiplying but still subtracts the unshaded area too.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a shaded region within a larger shape. They may mistakenly believe that to find the area of the shaded part, they need to subtract the ""unwanted"" portion from the side length of the entire shape before multiplying the lengths to find the area. However, they also incorrectly subtract the area of the unshaded region from the result of this multiplication, effectively subtracting twice.

For example, consider the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is given a rectangle with a smaller rectangle cut out of it. The student is asked to find the area of the remaining shaded region. They may subtract the width of the cut-out rectangle from the width of the larger rectangle, multiply this result by the length of the larger rectangle, and then subtract the area of the cut-out rectangle again.

- Case 2: A student is given a circle with a smaller sector cut out of it. The student is asked to find the area of the remaining shaded region. They may subtract the angle of the cut-out sector from 360 degrees, use this result to find a proportion of the radius, multiply this by the radius to find the ""new"" area, and then subtract the area of the cut-out sector again.

- Case 3: A student is given a composite shape consisting of two overlapping rectangles. The student is asked to find the area of the shaded region formed by the overlap. They may subtract the width of one rectangle from the width of the other, multiply this result by the length of one rectangle, and then subtract the area of the non-overlapping region of the other rectangle."
1296,Believes there are 90 degrees in a full turn,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a full turn or a full rotation is equivalent to 90 degrees. They may think that when they turn around in a complete circle, they have only covered 90 degrees, rather than the actual 360 degrees. This can be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of angles, degrees, and rotation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or describing the movement of objects in terms of degrees, students may assume that a full turn is only 90 degrees, leading to incorrect calculations and descriptions.
- In geometry and measurement problems, students may mistakenly apply the 90-degree concept to calculate perimeter, area, or volume of shapes, leading to incorrect answers.
- When working with real-life applications, such as navigation or design, students may misunderstand the relationship between degrees and rotation, leading to errors in calculations and decision-making.
- In problems involving circular motion or rotation, students may assume that 90 degrees is equivalent to a full turn, leading to incorrect calculations of speed, distance, or time."
1297,Believes you keep the divisor unchanged when dividing by a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing by a fraction and mistakenly think that the divisor (the number by which we are dividing) should remain unchanged. They may incorrectly assume that division by a fraction is the same as division by a whole number, where the divisor is not altered. As a result, they fail to invert the fraction (i.e., flip the numerator and denominator) and multiply, which is the correct procedure when dividing by a fraction.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Case 1: When dividing a whole number by a fraction (e.g., 6 ÷ 1/2), students might incorrectly divide 6 by 1 instead of multiplying 6 by the reciprocal of 1/2, which is 2.
- Case 2: When dividing one fraction by another fraction (e.g., 1/4 ÷ 1/2), students may fail to invert the second fraction (i.e., change it to 2/1) and multiply, leading to an incorrect result.
- Case 3: When solving algebraic expressions involving division by a fraction, such as (x/3) ÷ (1/2), students might not recognize the need to invert the fraction and multiply, resulting in an incorrect solution."
1298,Thinks multiple letters can be subtracted at once in Roman numerals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that in Roman numerals, multiple letters can be subtracted from a larger letter at once. In their understanding, they might think that if a smaller letter appears before a larger letter, all the smaller letters preceding the larger one should be subtracted. This would lead to incorrect calculations when converting Roman numerals to decimal numbers or performing arithmetic operations using Roman numerals.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When subtracting Roman numerals, such as IV (4) or IX (9), students might incorrectly subtract multiple letters at once if they appear in a sequence, like IIX or IIIV.
- When converting complex Roman numerals, such as MCMXCIX (1999), students may misapply the subtraction rule for multiple letters, leading to incorrect decimal conversions.
- When adding or subtracting Roman numerals, such as adding IV and IX, students with this misconception might miscalculate the result due to incorrect application of the subtraction rule for multiple letters."
1299,Ignores the zero when multiplying,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or forget to consider the effect of zero when multiplying numbers. In multiplication, any number multiplied by zero results in zero. However, some students may ignore this rule and calculate the product as if the zero was not present.

This misconception can be seen in the following cases:

- Multiplying multi-digit numbers: For example, when multiplying 205 by 3, students may ignore the zero and multiply 25 by 3, then add the result to 200 multiplied by 3, but forgetting that the zero in the tens place of 205 affects the product of the tens place.

- Multiplying decimals: When multiplying decimals that include zeros, such as 0.05 by 4, students may disregard the zeros and calculate the product as 5 multiplied by 4, resulting in an incorrect answer.

- Solving word problems: In word problems involving multiplication with zeros, students may misinterpret the context and ignore the zeros. For instance, if a problem states that a bookshelf has 5 rows of 0 boxes, students may incorrectly calculate the total number of boxes as 5, ignoring the fact that each row has zero boxes.

- Multiplying fractions: When multiplying fractions that include zeros, such as 1/10 by 5, students may overlook the zero in the denominator and calculate the product incorrectly."
1300,"In direct and inverse proportion, forgets to find the value of k, and carries out calculations as though k were 1","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with direct and inverse proportion problems. They understand that direct proportion is represented by the equation y = kx and inverse proportion by the equation y = k/x. However, they often overlook the importance of finding the value of the constant of proportionality, k. 

Instead of determining the value of k, students mistakenly assume it is equal to 1 and proceed with the calculations. This means they simplify the equations to y = x for direct proportion and y = 1/x for inverse proportion. As a result, their calculations and subsequent answers are incorrect.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: A recipe for making 4 cupcakes requires 120g of flour. A student wants to make 6 cupcakes and assumes the amount of flour needed is directly proportional to the number of cupcakes. Instead of finding k, they simply multiply 120g by 1.5 (6/4) without considering the actual value of k.

- Case 2: A student is given that the time taken to complete a task is inversely proportional to the number of people working on it. If 4 people can complete the task in 3 hours, they might assume that 1 person can complete it in 12 hours (3 x 4) without determining the value of k.

- Case 3: A car travels 250 miles in 5 hours. A student assumes that the distance traveled is directly proportional to the time taken. To find the distance traveled in 8 hours, they multiply 250 miles by 1.6 (8/5) without finding the value of k."
1301,"When subtracting a surd from an integer, just subtracts the number under the surd from the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with subtraction operations involving surds (also known as radicals) and integers. They may think that subtracting a surd from an integer is equivalent to simply subtracting the number under the radical sign from the integer. For example, when subtracting √3 from 5, students with this misconception might think the answer is 5 - 3 = 2, rather than recognizing that the surd cannot be simplified in this way.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* 7 - √2 = 7 - 2 = 5 (incorrect)
* 10 - √5 = 10 - 5 = 5 (incorrect)
* 3 - √4 = 3 - 4 = -1 (this might seem correct since √4 = 2, but the reasoning is still flawed)"
1302,"In ratio question where the difference between the sides is given, uses that as one part without dividing","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with ratio problems where they are given the difference between two parts of a ratio, rather than the actual values of the parts. In such cases, students may incorrectly assume that the difference is one of the parts of the ratio, rather than realizing that they need to divide the difference by the number of parts to find the actual value of one part.

For example, consider the following cases:

- A cake recipe requires a ratio of flour to sugar of 3:2. If the recipe uses 5 more parts of flour than sugar, some students may assume that the 5 is one part of the ratio, rather than realizing that they need to divide the 5 by the difference in the number of parts (3-2=1) to find the value of one part.
- A bookshelf has a ratio of 5 shelves for books and 3 shelves for decorations. If there are 2 more shelves for books than decorations, some students may incorrectly assume that the 2 is one part of the ratio, rather than dividing the 2 by the difference in the number of parts (5-3=2).
- A car travels 120 miles in a ratio of 3 parts on the highway and 2 parts on local roads. If it travels 20 more miles on the highway than on local roads, some students may assume that the 20 is one part of the ratio, rather than dividing the 20 by the difference in the number of parts (3-2=1)."
1303,Believes y=-f(x) is a reflection in y=-x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a function f(x) across the line y = -x will result in the function y = -f(x). However, reflecting a function f(x) across the line y = -x is not equivalent to simply changing the sign of the function. 

The reflection across y = -x involves swapping the x and y coordinates and then changing the sign of the new x and y coordinates. This misconception demonstrates a misunderstanding of the transformation rules for functions, specifically the difference between reflecting across the x-axis, y-axis, or lines such as y = x or y = -x.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:
1. Graphing functions: When graphing a function y = -f(x), a student with this misconception may incorrectly plot the points, thinking that they are reflecting the original function f(x) across y = -x.
2. Transforming functions: When transforming a function, a student with this misconception may incorrectly apply the transformation rules, resulting in an incorrect function.
3. Identifying symmetries: When identifying the symmetries of a function, a student with this misconception may incorrectly conclude that a function is symmetric with respect to y = -x when, in fact, it is symmetric with respect to the x-axis or another line."
1304,Confuses lines of the form y = a and y= ax,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between two types of linear equations: horizontal lines (y = a) and lines with a slope (y = ax). They may incorrectly assume that both equations represent the same type of line or that the 'a' in both equations serves the same purpose. In the equation y = a, 'a' represents the y-intercept, resulting in a horizontal line. On the other hand, in the equation y = ax, 'a' represents the slope of the line.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing lines, students may plot y = 2 as a line with a slope of 2 instead of a horizontal line 2 units above the x-axis.
- When given a table of values, students may incorrectly identify a constant value as a linear relationship with a slope, or vice versa.
- When solving word problems, students may misinterpret a constant rate of change (e.g., y = 2x) as a fixed value (e.g., y = 2).
- When simplifying equations, students may incorrectly simplify y = 2x to y = 2, losing the slope information.
- When comparing two lines, students may incorrectly conclude that lines of the form y = a and y = ax have the same characteristics or behaviors."
1305,believes that a fraction with the largest denominator will be smallest regardless of the numerator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of fractions and believe that the size of the denominator alone determines the size of the fraction. They incorrectly assume that a fraction with a larger denominator will always be smaller, without considering the numerator. This can lead to incorrect comparisons and ordering of fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing 1/4 and 2/8: Students may incorrectly believe that 2/8 is smaller because it has a larger denominator, even though the fractions are equivalent.
- Ordering fractions such as 3/4, 2/6, and 1/8: Students may incorrectly order these fractions from smallest to largest based solely on the denominator, without considering the numerator.
- Simplifying fractions: Students may struggle to simplify fractions, such as 4/8, because they believe that the larger denominator makes the fraction smaller, rather than recognizing that the numerator and denominator can be reduced.
- Real-world applications: When measuring ingredients for a recipe, students may incorrectly believe that 1/4 cup is smaller than 2/8 cup, leading to incorrect measurements."
1306,Finds the median instead of the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the range of a set of numbers, but instead, they find the median. The median is the middle value in a set of numbers when arranged in order, whereas the range is the difference between the largest and smallest values. Students may get confused between these two concepts, especially if they are not paying close attention to the specific question being asked.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a set of exam scores and are asked to find the range, but instead, they arrange the scores in order and find the middle value (median).
- When students are working with a dataset and are asked to calculate the range of values, but they mistakenly use the formula for finding the median.
- When students are asked to compare the range of values in two different datasets, but instead, they compare the medians of the two datasets."
1307,Finds the degrees for 1 person rather than the required number of people for a pie chart sector,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to calculate the size of a sector in a pie chart, which represents a proportion of a whole. Instead of finding the angle that represents the proportion for the entire group or category, they mistakenly calculate the angle for one person or one item, resulting in an incorrect answer.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A survey of 20 students shows that 4 students prefer pizza for lunch. When asked to create a pie chart, the student calculates the angle for 1 student who likes pizza (e.g., 360/20 = 18 degrees) instead of the angle for the 4 students who prefer pizza.
- Case 2: A pie chart is being created to represent the favorite colors of 50 people, and 10 people chose blue. The student mistakenly calculates the angle for 1 person who chose blue (e.g., 360/50 = 7.2 degrees) instead of the angle for the 10 people who chose blue.
- Case 3: A student is analyzing data on the favorite sports of 30 people and finds that 6 people prefer soccer. When creating a pie chart, the student incorrectly calculates the angle for 1 person who likes soccer (e.g., 360/30 = 12 degrees) instead of the angle for the 6 people who prefer soccer."
1308,"Thinks tables of values are symmetrical about (0,0)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any table of values representing a relationship between two variables (usually x and y) will always be symmetrical about the point (0,0). This means they expect that if a point (x, y) is on the table, then the point (-x, -y) will also be on the table, resulting in a symmetrical pattern about the origin.

This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the properties of linear and quadratic relationships, or an overemphasis on the symmetry of certain mathematical functions, such as the graph of y = x^2. As a result, students may incorrectly assume that all tables of values will exhibit this symmetry.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When graphing a linear function, such as y = 2x + 3, students may expect the table of values to be symmetrical about (0,0), even though the graph is actually a straight line that is not symmetrical about the origin.
2. When working with a quadratic function, such as y = x^2 + 2x + 1, students may mistakenly assume that the table of values will be symmetrical about (0,0), even though the graph is actually a parabola that is symmetrical about its vertex, not the origin.
3. When analyzing a table of values representing real-world data, such as the relationship between temperature and humidity, students may incorrectly expect the data to be symmetrical about (0,0), even though the actual relationship may be more complex and not exhibit this symmetry."
1309,Believes the numerator is the top of a fraction ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term ""numerator"" as referring to the physical position of a number in a fraction, rather than its function. They believe that the numerator is the top number in a fraction solely because of its location, without understanding its role in representing the number of equal parts being referred to. This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding equivalent fractions, comparing fractions, and performing operations with fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to identify the numerator in a fraction written in a non-standard way, such as a vertical fraction or a fraction with a diagonal line.
- When students are given a fraction with a numerator that is not the top number, such as in the case of a fraction written with a negative sign or a fraction with a numerator written below the denominator.
- When students are asked to compare fractions with different denominators and mistakenly focus on the physical position of the numbers rather than their values."
1310,"When interpreting a pictogram, thinks each symbol stands for 1","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that each symbol or picture in a pictogram represents a single unit or one item, regardless of the actual value or quantity it is intended to represent. In pictograms, symbols often represent a set or group of items, and the key to understanding the data lies in understanding the value assigned to each symbol. Students with this misconception may fail to account for the actual value or quantity represented by each symbol, leading to incorrect interpretations of the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A pictogram shows three pictures of cars to represent 15 cars sold, with each picture representing 5 cars. A student with this misconception may think that only 3 cars were sold.
2. A pictogram uses symbols to represent the number of books read by students in a class, with each symbol representing 10 books. If the pictogram shows 2 symbols for a particular student, a student with this misconception may think that the student read only 2 books.
3. A pictogram displays the number of fruits eaten by a group of people, with each picture of a fruit representing 5 fruits. If the pictogram shows 4 pictures of apples, a student with this misconception may think that only 4 apples were eaten."
1311,"
Has incorrect belief about the meaning of ""formula""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a narrow or incorrect understanding of what a formula is. They may believe that a formula is just a set of numbers and operations to be performed in a specific order, without understanding the underlying mathematical concept or relationship it represents. For example, they may view the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = length × width) as simply a procedure to follow, without grasping the idea that the formula represents the relationship between the area, length, and width of a rectangle.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When students are asked to apply a formula to solve a problem, but they don't understand the underlying concept, leading to errors or incorrect application.
* When students are asked to derive or prove a formula, but they struggle to do so because they don't understand the underlying mathematical relationships.
* When students are given a new formula to learn, but they don't connect it to their prior knowledge or understanding of the underlying concept, leading to memorization rather than true understanding.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is asked to find the area of a rectangle with a length of 5cm and a width of 3cm. They correctly apply the formula A = length × width, but when asked to explain why the formula works, they struggle to provide a clear answer.
* A student is given the formula for the volume of a sphere (V = (4/3)πr^3) and asked to apply it to find the volume of a sphere with a radius of 2cm. However, when asked to explain what the formula represents, they simply state that it's a ""formula to find the volume"" without showing any understanding of the underlying concept.
* A student is asked to derive the formula for the area of a triangle (A = 0.5 × base × height) using geometric principles. However, they struggle to do so because they don't understand the relationship between the area, base, and height of a triangle."
1312,Believes f(x) + a translates the function right a units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of adding a constant 'a' to a function f(x). They incorrectly believe that adding 'a' to the function shifts the graph of the function to the right by 'a' units. In reality, adding 'a' to a function shifts the graph vertically, not horizontally.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing simple functions, such as f(x) = x, and adding a constant to it, students might expect the graph to shift to the right instead of up.
- When working with transformations of functions, students might confuse the effect of adding a constant to the function with the effect of adding a constant to the input (x-value).
- When solving problems involving function translations, students might incorrectly apply the transformation, resulting in a graph that is shifted in the wrong direction.
- When comparing the graphs of different functions, such as f(x) and f(x) + a, students might incorrectly identify the translation as a horizontal shift instead of a vertical shift."
1313,Found the percentage but forgot to add to 100%,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating a percentage increase or decrease, and after finding the percentage, they forget to add or subtract it from the original 100% to find the new total. This results in an incorrect final answer, as the percentage change is not being applied to the original value. 

For example, if a shirt is on sale for 25% off, a student might calculate 25% of the original price but then forget to subtract that amount from the original price to find the sale price. Similarly, if a quantity is increasing by 15%, a student might calculate 15% of the original amount but then forget to add that amount to the original 100% to find the new total.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Calculating discounts or sales prices of items.
- Finding the final amount after a percentage increase in price, quantity, or value.
- Determining the final result after multiple percentage changes (e.g., a 10% increase followed by a 5% decrease).
- Comparing percentage changes in different contexts, such as comparing the increase in the cost of two different items."
1314,Only uses the closest angle to the unknown when using the angles in a straight line relationship,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with the angles in a straight line relationship, which states that the sum of the angles in a straight line is 180 degrees. The misconception occurs when students incorrectly assume that the unknown angle is always closest to the given angle and only use that given angle to find the unknown angle, rather than considering the entire straight line and the relationship between all the angles.

This misconception can manifest in different ways, such as:

* When finding a missing angle in a straight line, students may only use the adjacent angle to calculate the missing angle, without considering the entire straight line.
* When solving problems involving multiple angles in a straight line, students may only focus on the closest angle to the unknown, rather than using the entire relationship to find the solution.
* When dealing with more complex problems, such as finding angles in a diagram with multiple straight lines and angles, students may become confused and only use the closest angle, rather than analyzing the entire diagram and using the relationships between all the angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: Find the missing angle in a straight line with two given angles: 60° and 70°. A student with this misconception may assume the missing angle is closest to 70° and only use that angle to calculate the answer.
* Case 2: Solve for x in the equation: x + 40° + 90° = 180°. A student with this misconception may only use the 90° angle to find x, rather than using the entire equation.
* Case 3: Find the value of angle A in a diagram with multiple straight lines and angles. A student with this misconception may become confused and only use the closest angle to A, rather than analyzing the entire diagram and using the relationships between all the angles."
1315,Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (nearest ten rather than nearest whole number),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers, but they incorrectly choose the degree of accuracy. Instead of rounding to the nearest whole number as requested, they round to the nearest ten. This may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of rounding, or an overreliance on the ""rule"" of rounding to the nearest ten, which is often taught in earlier years. 

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When asked to round the number 43 to the nearest whole number, the student rounds it to 40.
- When asked to round the number 87 to the nearest whole number, the student rounds it to 90.
- When asked to round the number 12.8 to the nearest whole number, the student rounds it to 10.
- When asked to round the number 9.4 to the nearest whole number, the student rounds it to 10, but when asked to round 9.6, they also round it to 10, showing an inconsistency in their understanding."
1316,Does not understand that the numerator and denominator of fractions represent groupings and have the same order of priority as brackets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that the numerator and denominator of a fraction are separate groupings that need to be evaluated independently before simplifying or comparing fractions. They may not understand that the division line between the numerator and denominator acts as a separator, similar to how brackets are used to group numbers and operations in an expression.

Students with this misconception may not realize that operations within the numerator and denominator should be evaluated separately, following the order of operations (e.g., parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction). This can lead to incorrect calculations when working with fractions, especially when there are multiple operations involved.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

1. When adding fractions with different denominators: Students may incorrectly add the numerators and denominators separately without finding the common denominator.
Example: 1/4 + 1/6 = (1+1)/(4+6) = 2/10 (incorrect)
2. When simplifying complex fractions: Students may not evaluate the expressions in the numerator and denominator separately before simplifying.
Example: (2+3)/4 = 5/4 (correct), but students may incorrectly evaluate this as 2/(3+4) = 2/7.
3. When comparing fractions: Students may compare the numerators and denominators separately without considering the fraction as a whole.
Example: Comparing 1/2 and 2/3, students may say 2/3 is smaller because 2 is smaller than 3, without realizing that the denominators are different.
4. When performing operations with mixed numbers: Students may not convert the mixed number to an improper fraction before performing operations, leading to incorrect calculations.
Example: 2 1/2 + 1 1/3 = ? (students may incorrectly add the whole numbers and fractions separately)"
1317,Identifies wrong place value column after decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the place value columns after the decimal point. They may incorrectly identify the columns as the same as those before the decimal point (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), rather than understanding that the columns after the decimal point represent tenths, hundredths, thousandths, and so on.

This misconception can lead students to misinterpret and miscalculate decimal numbers. For example:

* Case 1: A student is asked to round 4.237 to the nearest tenth. They incorrectly identify the 3 as being in the tens column and round the number to 40.3.
* Case 2: A student is asked to add 2.45 and 1.27. They incorrectly line up the numbers, adding the 4 and 2 as if they were in the tens column, resulting in an incorrect sum.
* Case 3: A student is asked to compare the numbers 5.23 and 5.32. They incorrectly identify the 2 and 3 as being in the tens column and conclude that 5.23 is greater than 5.32."
1318,Does not understand that shapes are congruent if they have the same size and shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that for two shapes to be considered the same, they must be oriented or positioned in the same way. They might not fully grasp that congruent shapes can be rotated, reflected, or translated and still be considered identical in terms of size and shape. This understanding is fundamental to geometry, as congruence is a key concept in comparing and analyzing shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two shapes that are mirror images of each other (e.g., one shape is a reflection of the other across a line of symmetry).
- When one shape is rotated relative to the other, but they are otherwise identical.
- When two shapes are identical but are positioned differently on a coordinate plane or a grid.
- When working with real-world objects, such as two identical puzzle pieces that can be oriented differently but still fit together perfectly.
- When using technology, such as geometry software, to explore and manipulate shapes, leading to misunderstandings about what makes shapes congruent."
1319,Adds instead of multiples,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add numbers instead of multiplying them, often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition. For example, when asked to find the area of a rectangle, students may add the length and width instead of multiplying them. This misconception can also arise when dealing with scaling, proportions, or calculating the total cost of multiple items.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Area calculation: A student is asked to find the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 cm and a width of 3 cm. Instead of multiplying 5 and 3, they add the numbers, resulting in an incorrect answer of 8 cm².
2. Scaling: A student is asked to scale up a recipe that serves 4 people to serve 6 people. Instead of multiplying the ingredients by 1.5, they add 2 to each ingredient, resulting in an incorrect quantity.
3. Proportional reasoning: A student is asked to find the total cost of 3 groups of 4 pencils, with each pencil costing $2. Instead of multiplying 3, 4, and $2, they add the numbers, resulting in an incorrect total cost.
4. Word problems: A student is asked to solve a word problem that involves multiplying numbers, such as ""Tom has 3 groups of 5 friends coming over. How many friends will he have in total?"" Instead of multiplying 3 and 5, they add the numbers, resulting in an incorrect answer."
1320,Multiplied by 10 rather than 100,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are required to convert a decimal number to a percentage or perform other operations involving place value, but they mistakenly multiply or divide by 10 instead of 100. This often stems from a lack of understanding of place value concepts and the relationships between different place values. As a result, students may incorrectly adjust the decimal point or perform the wrong operation, leading to an incorrect answer.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Converting a decimal to a percentage: A student may write 0.5 as 5% instead of 50% because they multiplied by 10 instead of 100.
2. Performing calculations with percentages: When calculating a 10% increase, a student might multiply by 1.1 (10% of 10) instead of 1.01 (1% of 100) or simply add 10 instead of 10% of the original value.
3. Converting between units of measurement: A student may mistakenly convert 10 grams to 1 kilogram instead of 100 grams to 1 kilogram.
4. Rounding or estimating numbers: When rounding a number to the nearest hundred, a student might mistakenly look at the tens digit instead of the hundreds digit.
5. Calculating interest or growth: A student may calculate simple interest as 10 times the principal instead of using the correct percentage."
1321,Thinks angles which look the same on diagram will be equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that if two angles appear to be the same size or look congruent in a diagram, they must be equal in measure. They may not consider the actual measurements or relationships between the angles, relying solely on visual inspection. This can lead to incorrect assumptions and calculations in geometry problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When drawing two triangles that appear to be similar, students may assume that corresponding angles are equal without checking their measurements.
2. In a diagram with multiple intersecting lines, students might assume that angles that look the same are equal, even if they are not corresponding angles.
3. When solving problems involving angles in circles, students may incorrectly assume that angles subtended by the same arc are equal just because they look the same.
4. In a geometric construction, students might believe that two angles are equal because they appear to be symmetrical, without verifying their measurements."
1322,Does not know how many days are in a leap year,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unclear or have incomplete knowledge about the concept of a leap year. A leap year is a year that has 366 days, one more day than the usual 365 days in a non-leap year. The extra day is added to the month of February, making it a 29-day month instead of the usual 28 days. Students with this misconception may think a leap year has the same number of days as a non-leap year or may be unsure about the number of days in a leap year.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the number of days between two dates that include a leap year.
- When determining the day of the week for a specific date in a leap year.
- When solving problems that involve the calculation of time intervals, such as ages or anniversaries, that span across a leap year.
- When working with calendars or timetables to plan events or schedule appointments in a leap year.
- When analyzing data or trends that are affected by the extra day in a leap year, such as financial or sales data."
1323,"When multiplying surds in the form ✓a × b✓c, believes the answer is  ✓(abc)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the properties of surds, specifically when multiplying two surds. They may incorrectly assume that the multiplication of two surds involves multiplying the numbers inside the square roots together. In this case, they believe that the product of ✓a and b✓c is ✓(abc), incorrectly combining the numbers inside the square roots.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying two simple surds: A student may write ✓2 × 3✓4 as ✓(2 × 3 × 4) = ✓24.
- When multiplying a surd with a coefficient: A student may write 2✓3 × 4✓5 as 8✓(3 × 5) = 8✓15, which is correct, but if they then apply the misconception, they may write it as 8✓(3 × 4 × 5) = 8✓60.
- When working with more complex expressions: A student may write (2 + ✓3) × (4 + 2✓5) and incorrectly simplify it to 8 + 4✓(3 × 5) + 2✓(3 × 4 × 5) + 4✓(5 × 3), leading to an incorrect result."
1324,"When solving an equation, believes that when they get to ax = b, b is the solution","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of solving linear equations. They may correctly manipulate the equation to isolate the variable term on one side, resulting in the form ax = b. However, they incorrectly assume that the value of b is the solution to the equation, rather than recognizing that they need to divide both sides by the coefficient 'a' to find the value of x.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* Solving simple linear equations like 2x = 6, where the student may incorrectly state that the solution is 6, rather than dividing both sides by 2 to get x = 3.
* When working with more complex equations like 4x + 2 = 10, and the student correctly simplifies it to 4x = 8, but then incorrectly states that the solution is 8.
* When solving word problems that involve linear equations, such as ""Tom has 3 times as many books as his friend Alex. If Tom has 12 books, how many books does Alex have?"" and the student sets up the equation 3x = 12, but then incorrectly states that Alex has 12 books."
1325,Has found area of triangle rather than area of square,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a square but instead, they use the formula for the area of a triangle (1/2 × base × height) rather than the formula for the area of a square (side × side or side squared). This shows a lack of understanding of the different formulas for various shapes and the inability to apply the correct formula to the given problem.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When a square is drawn with a diagonal line and students mistakenly think they need to find the area of one of the triangles formed.
2. When a square is shown with a height or altitude drawn within it, leading students to think the problem is asking for the area of a triangle.
3. When a word problem describes a square but includes measurements that could also apply to a triangle, causing students to become confused and apply the wrong formula."
1326,Does not know the meaning of square sign for right angle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unfamiliar with or misunderstand the symbol used to represent a right angle in geometry, which is a square sign (∟ or sometimes marked as a small square where the angle is). The square sign is often used in diagrams to indicate a 90-degree angle between two lines or planes. Students with this misconception may not recognize the significance of the square sign, leading to difficulties in understanding and working with right-angled shapes, such as triangles and rectangles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When identifying right-angled triangles, students may not recognize the square sign as an indicator of a 90-degree angle.
* In geometry problems, students may ignore the square sign and incorrectly calculate angles or side lengths in right-angled shapes.
* When constructing or drawing shapes, students may not include the square sign to indicate right angles, leading to inaccurate representations.
* In real-world applications, such as building design or carpentry, students may not recognize the importance of right angles and the square sign in ensuring accurate measurements and constructions."
1327,Does not know the meaning of attribute data,"Explanation: Attribute data refers to the characteristics or qualities of objects or individuals being measured or observed. Students who hold this misconception may believe that data only refers to numerical values, and they may not understand that data can also be categorical or descriptive. For example, they may not recognize that colors, shapes, or textures can be considered data.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When collecting data on favorite colors, students may think that they need to assign a numerical value to each color rather than simply recording the color itself.
- When describing the characteristics of a set of objects, students may focus only on measurable attributes like length or weight, and neglect to consider non-numerical attributes like shape or material.
- When creating graphs or charts, students may struggle to represent non-numerical data, such as categories or labels, and may try to assign numerical values to these attributes in order to plot them.
- When analyzing data, students may overlook or dismiss non-numerical data as ""not real data"" or ""not important,"" and focus only on numerical data."
1328,"When reading off from the left side of a back to back stem and leaf, mixes up the value of the leaf and the stem","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with back-to-back stem and leaf diagrams, which are used to display two sets of data that share the same stem but have different leaves. In a back-to-back stem and leaf diagram, one set of data is displayed on the left side of the stem, and the other set is displayed on the right side. 

The misconception occurs when students incorrectly interpret the values on the left side of the stem. Instead of correctly combining the stem with its corresponding leaf, they swap the values of the leaf and the stem, resulting in an incorrect reading of the data point. For example, if the stem is ""4"" and the leaf on the left is ""2"", a student with this misconception might read the value as ""24"" instead of the correct value ""42"".

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When comparing the data distribution of two different groups, such as the scores of two different teams in a competition.
- When analyzing data that has been collected over a period of time, such as the temperature readings of two different cities.
- When creating a back-to-back stem and leaf diagram to display the data collected from two different surveys."
1329,Believes it is not possible to calculate the frequency for a pie chart sector despite being given enough information to do so,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given information about a pie chart, such as the total number of items or the proportion of a sector, but they mistakenly believe that without the actual number of items in each sector, it is impossible to calculate the frequency of a particular sector. They may struggle to make connections between the proportion of the sector, the total number of items, and the frequency of the sector.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A pie chart shows that 1/4 of the students in a school prefer a certain flavor of ice cream. If there are 100 students in total, some students might think they cannot find the number of students who prefer that flavor without additional information.
2. A pie chart displays the proportion of different types of fruits sold at a market, with 30% being apples. Given that 500 fruits were sold, students might believe they cannot calculate the number of apples sold.
3. A survey of favorite sports is represented as a pie chart, with 20% of respondents choosing soccer. If 250 people responded to the survey, some students might think it's impossible to determine the number of people who chose soccer without more information."
1330,Believes they can still have the variable on both sides when making it the subject,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving algebraic equations and trying to isolate the variable (make it the subject). They may incorrectly believe that it's acceptable to leave the variable on both sides of the equation, as long as they have isolated it in some way. This shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental rule that when making a variable the subject, it should be isolated on one side of the equation, with no instances of the variable on the other side.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When solving linear equations, such as 2x + 3 = x + 5, a student might incorrectly leave the variable on both sides by doing an operation like subtracting x from both sides but still having x's on both sides.
- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as x + 2x = 3x + 4, a student might not fully isolate the variable and instead leave it on both sides of the equation.
- When solving quadratic equations, such as x^2 + 2x = x^2 + 5, a student might not properly isolate the variable and instead leave it on both sides of the equation."
1331,Believes angles in a quadrilateral sum to 450 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception may arise when students incorrectly generalize the sum of angles from triangles to quadrilaterals. They may know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, but when it comes to quadrilaterals, they mistakenly assume that since a quadrilateral can be divided into three triangles (by drawing two diagonals from one vertex), the sum of its angles is 3 times 180 degrees (i.e., 540 degrees) minus 90 degrees (the angle they incorrectly assume is ""lost"" when the two triangles are combined), resulting in 450 degrees.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When finding the missing angle in a quadrilateral: A student is given a quadrilateral with three angles measuring 100, 120, and 90 degrees. They may incorrectly calculate the missing angle as 450 - (100 + 120 + 90) = 140 degrees.

2. When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles of different polygons: Students may incorrectly apply the 450-degree rule to other polygons, thinking that all polygons have a similar pattern.

3. When working with complex shapes: When dealing with complex shapes that involve multiple quadrilaterals, students may incorrectly apply the 450-degree rule to find the sum of interior angles."
1332,"When adding, just writes the digit to the right of the number without considering place value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of place value in addition. They tend to simply append the digit being added to the right of the original number, without considering the actual value of the digit's place. For example, when asked to add 5 to 14, a student with this misconception might write 145, instead of performing the correct operation.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When adding single-digit numbers to multi-digit numbers, e.g., 5 + 14 = ?
- When adding numbers with different place values, e.g., 50 + 3 = ?
- When solving word problems that involve addition, e.g., ""Tom has 12 pencils and his friend gives him 2 more.""
- When using mental math or estimating sums, e.g., quickly calculating 24 + 5 = ?
- When regrouping or carrying over in addition problems, e.g., 45 + 27 = ?

In each of these cases, the student's failure to consider place value leads to incorrect results."
1333,Halves base but still divides product by 2 when finding area of a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a triangle and they correctly identify that the base needs to be halved, but mistakenly still divide the product by 2. They understand that the formula for the area of a triangle involves half the base, but incorrectly assume that this means they need to divide the entire product of base and height by 2, in addition to using half the base.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When finding the area of a right-angled triangle with a base of 6cm and a height of 8cm. The student may halve the base to 3cm, multiply it by the height (3 x 8 = 24), and then still divide the product by 2 (24 ÷ 2 = 12).
- When solving a problem that involves finding the area of an isosceles triangle with a base of 10cm and a height of 5cm. The student may halve the base to 5cm, multiply it by the height (5 x 5 = 25), and then still divide the product by 2 (25 ÷ 2 = 12.5).
- When working on a real-world problem, such as finding the area of a triangular garden bed with a base of 15m and a height of 8m. The student may halve the base to 7.5m, multiply it by the height (7.5 x 8 = 60), and then still divide the product by 2 (60 ÷ 2 = 30)."
1334,Tries to multiply within place value columns during column multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of column multiplication, particularly when dealing with multi-digit numbers. They may attempt to multiply the numbers within each place value column, rather than following the standard procedure of multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number and then combining the results.

For example, when multiplying 43 by 27, a student with this misconception might try to multiply the tens column of 43 (40) by the tens column of 27 (20), and then multiply the ones column of 43 (3) by the ones column of 27 (7). This would lead to an incorrect calculation, as the student is not considering the place value of each digit in the correct way.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying multi-digit numbers with zeros in the middle (e.g., 405 x 27)
- Multiplying numbers with multiple digits in the tens or hundreds place (e.g., 43 x 219)
- Solving word problems that involve multiplying multi-digit numbers (e.g., finding the area of a rectangle with a length of 43 cm and a width of 27 cm)"
1335,Believes volume of a cuboid is the area of the three unique faces multiplied together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of volume and its relationship to the dimensions of a 3D shape, specifically a cuboid. They may think that by multiplying the areas of the three unique faces (length x width, width x height, and length x height), they are accounting for the entire 3D space inside the cuboid. However, this method incorrectly multiplies areas together, rather than considering the actual amount of space inside the shape.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the volume of a rectangular prism (cuboid) and they mistakenly multiply the areas of the faces together, rather than using the correct formula of length x width x height.
- When comparing the volumes of different cuboids, students may incorrectly assume that the cuboid with the larger surface area has a larger volume.
- When solving real-world problems, such as calculating the volume of a room or a container, students with this misconception may arrive at incorrect answers, leading to potential errors in design, construction, or capacity calculations."
1336,Does not realise addition is commutative,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that the order of numbers in an addition problem affects the result. They may think that a + b is not equal to b + a, and that the order of the numbers changes the outcome of the addition. For example, they might believe that 2 + 3 is not the same as 3 + 2.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to solve simple addition problems, such as 5 + 2 and 2 + 5, and they give different answers for each problem.
- When students are given word problems, such as ""Tom has 3 pencils and his friend gives him 2 more"" and ""Tom has 2 pencils and his friend gives him 3 more"", and they think the answers will be different.
- When students are asked to complete number sentences, such as 4 + ___ = 7 and ___ + 4 = 7, and they fill in different numbers for each sentence."
1337,Does not understand the phrase to the power of,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of exponents, but struggle to comprehend the meaning of ""to the power of."" They may interpret the phrase as simply multiplying the base number by the exponent, rather than understanding that it represents repeated multiplication of the base number. For example, when seeing the expression 2^3, students with this misconception might think it means 2 multiplied by 3, rather than 2 multiplied by itself 3 times.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying expressions with exponents, like 2^4 or 3^2.
- When solving equations that involve exponents, like 2^x = 8.
- When working with real-world applications, like calculating the area of a square (e.g., 4^2) or the volume of a cube (e.g., 3^3).
- When dealing with more complex mathematical operations, like comparing the values of 2^3 and 3^2.
- When exploring exponential growth or decay in different contexts, such as population growth or chemical reactions."
1338,Does not understand the effect of consecutive operations,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that the order in which operations are performed can significantly affect the outcome. They may assume that consecutive operations, such as addition and subtraction, or multiplication and division, can be performed in any order without changing the result.

In the case of addition and subtraction, students may not understand that the order of operations can change the sign of the result. For example, subtracting 3 from 5 and then adding 2 is not the same as adding 2 to 5 and then subtracting 3.

Similarly, with multiplication and division, students may not recognize that the order of operations can affect the magnitude of the result. For instance, multiplying 6 by 3 and then dividing by 2 is not the same as dividing 6 by 2 and then multiplying by 3.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

1. A student is asked to evaluate the expression 5 - 3 + 2 and gets the wrong answer because they perform the operations in the wrong order.
2. A student is given the expression 6 × 3 ÷ 2 and incorrectly assumes that they can divide 6 by 2 first and then multiply by 3.
3. A student is solving a word problem that involves consecutive operations, such as ""Tom has 15 pencils, he gives 3 to his friend, and then receives 2 more. How many pencils does Tom have now?"" The student may perform the operations in the wrong order, leading to an incorrect answer."
1339,Calculated the hours and minutes separately,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating time intervals or adding/subtracting time. They tend to separate hours and minutes, treating them as independent units, and perform calculations on them separately. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when dealing with time intervals that span across hour boundaries. For instance, when adding 45 minutes to 9:30, a student with this misconception might add 45 minutes to 30 minutes (ignoring the 9 hours) and get 75 minutes, then incorrectly convert this to 1 hour 15 minutes, resulting in an answer of 10:15, instead of the correct 10:15.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Adding 2 hours 30 minutes to 8:45
- Subtracting 1 hour 15 minutes from 12:00
- Finding the time interval between 9:00 and 11:45
- Calculating the end time of a 2-hour 45-minute movie that starts at 7:15."
1340,Misunderstands dashed lines as being the midpoint,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a dashed line on a diagram or graph automatically represents the midpoint or middle value of a shape or data set. They may assume that the dashed line is always dividing the shape or data into two equal parts, which is not necessarily the case. In reality, dashed lines can serve various purposes, such as indicating a boundary, separating sections, or highlighting a specific feature.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When interpreting graphs with dashed lines as gridlines or axis markers, students might assume the dashed line represents the midpoint of the data range.
* In geometric shapes, students might think that a dashed line dividing the shape is automatically the midpoint or median, rather than considering other possibilities, such as it being a diagonal or a line of symmetry.
* When working with number lines, students may believe that a dashed line marking a specific value is the midpoint of the number line or a range of numbers, rather than recognizing it as a marker for a specific value or boundary."
1341,Multiplies instead of divides by 100 when converting a percentage to a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a percentage to a decimal. They mistakenly believe that to convert a percentage, they should multiply the percentage value by 100, rather than dividing it by 100. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of percentages and decimals, or simply a reversal of the correct operation.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting 25% to a decimal, a student may multiply 25 by 100 to get 2500, instead of dividing 25 by 100 to get 0.25.
- When converting 50% to a decimal, a student may multiply 50 by 100 to get 5000, instead of dividing 50 by 100 to get 0.5.
- When converting 10% to a decimal, a student may multiply 10 by 100 to get 1000, instead of dividing 10 by 100 to get 0.1."
1342,"When adding decimals, does not keep place value the same as the original digits","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding decimal numbers, but they fail to align the place values correctly. They might treat the decimal numbers as whole numbers and simply add the digits without considering the place value of each digit. For example, when adding 2.5 and 1.7, they might write:

2.5
+1.7
------
4.12 (incorrect)

Instead of aligning the decimal points and adding the corresponding place values.

This misconception can occur in the following short cases:

* When adding money amounts, such as £2.50 + £1.75, students might write £4.25 instead of £4.25.
* When measuring lengths, such as 2.5m + 1.7m, students might write 4.12m instead of 4.2m.
* When calculating the total cost of items, such as £2.50 + £1.70, students might write £4.20 instead of £4.20."
1343,"When substituting into an algebraic term, replaces variables with numbers without multiplying.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that variables in an algebraic term often represent unknown values that are to be multiplied by coefficients. When substituting numbers into these terms, students may simply replace the variable with the number, forgetting to perform the necessary multiplication. This oversight can lead to incorrect simplification and ultimately, incorrect solutions to algebraic problems.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

- When substituting x = 3 into the expression 2x, a student may write 2(3) as 23 instead of 6.
- When substituting y = 4 into the expression 5y, a student may write 5(4) as 54 instead of 20.
- When substituting z = 2 into the expression 3z + 1, a student may write 3(2) + 1 as 32 + 1 instead of 6 + 1.
- When substituting x = 5 into the expression x/2, a student may write (5)/2 as 52 instead of 5/2 or 2.5."
1344,Estimates angle without using knowledge of degrees in quarter turns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to estimate or identify angles but instead of using their knowledge of degrees in quarter turns (e.g. 90, 180, 270, 360 degrees), they rely solely on visual inspection, making rough guesses, or using vague descriptions such as ""big"" or ""small"". This shows a lack of understanding of how angles can be measured and described using standard units of measurement (degrees).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is shown a picture of a corner of a square and is asked to estimate the angle, but instead of recognizing it as a right angle (90 degrees), they simply say ""it's a big angle"".
- A student is asked to draw an angle of approximately 270 degrees, but instead of using their knowledge of quarter turns, they draw a random angle that they think ""looks about right"".
- A student is given a real-life scenario, such as estimating the angle of a roof or a slope, but instead of using their knowledge of angles to make an informed estimate, they make a wild guess."
1345,Inserts brackets but not changed order of operation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand that brackets are used to group numbers or operations together but fail to realize that the order of operations is altered when brackets are inserted. They may simply add the brackets without considering the new order in which operations should be performed. As a result, they may still follow the original order of operations, which can lead to incorrect calculations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions such as 3 + 4 × 2, students may incorrectly insert brackets to make it (3 + 4) × 2 instead of following the correct order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).
- In algebra, when solving equations like 2 × x + 5, students may insert brackets incorrectly, resulting in (2 × x) + 5 being calculated as 2 × (x + 5).
- When working with numbers, students may incorrectly simplify expressions such as 12 - 3 + 4 by inserting brackets to make it (12 - 3) + 4, but then incorrectly following the original order, resulting in 12 - (3 + 4) instead."
1346,Mixes up squaring with repeating a digit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number means repeating the digit. For example, they might think that 2 squared (2²) equals 22, or 5 squared (5²) equals 55. This misconception arises from a misunderstanding of the concept of exponentiation and the notation used to represent it. Students may incorrectly apply the concept of repeating a digit when they see the exponent ², rather than understanding that it represents the number being multiplied by itself.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to the concept of exponents and are unsure of how to apply them.
- When students are multiplying numbers with the same digit, such as 2 x 2 or 5 x 5, and mistakenly assume that the answer is simply the digit repeated.
- When students are working with multi-digit numbers and incorrectly apply the repeating digit rule, for example, thinking that 12 squared equals 1212 rather than 144.
- When students are working on word problems that involve squaring numbers and misapply the concept, leading to incorrect solutions."
1347,Believes a circle achieves what a perpendicular bisector does,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a circle can be used to achieve the same function as a perpendicular bisector, which is to divide a line segment into two equal parts and form a 90-degree angle with the line. They may think that drawing a circle with the midpoint of the line segment as its center will automatically create two equal parts. However, this is not the case, as a circle is a continuous curved shape that does not necessarily divide a line segment into two equal parts.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to divide a line segment into two equal parts, they might draw a circle with the midpoint as the center instead of drawing a perpendicular bisector.
- When working with geometric shapes, students might try to use a circle to find the midpoint of a line segment instead of using the correct method of drawing a perpendicular bisector.
- In construction tasks, students might attempt to use a circle to create a 90-degree angle with a line segment, rather than using a perpendicular bisector or other construction methods.
- When solving problems involving symmetry, students might mistakenly believe that a circle can be used to create a line of symmetry, rather than using a perpendicular bisector or other methods."
1348,Does not recognise a parallelogram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify a parallelogram, which is a type of quadrilateral with two pairs of parallel sides. They may not recognize the characteristics of a parallelogram, such as opposite sides being equal in length, opposite angles being equal, and the presence of two pairs of parallel sides.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly classify shapes, thinking that a parallelogram is a rectangle, a square, or a rhombus, but not recognizing it as a distinct type of quadrilateral.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to identify and classify different types of quadrilaterals, students may not recognize a parallelogram and instead label it as a rectangle or a square.
* When given a diagram of a parallelogram, students may not be able to identify its characteristics, such as the equal opposite sides and angles.
* When asked to create a parallelogram using various materials, such as paper or blocks, students may create a shape that does not meet the criteria of a parallelogram.
* When solving problems involving perimeter and area of parallelograms, students may not recognize the shape and therefore struggle to apply the correct formulas."
1349,Does not include negative numbers when calculating a range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating the range of a set of data and they only consider the positive numbers or the numbers that are larger, ignoring the negative numbers or the numbers that are smaller. They may think that the range is only the difference between the largest and smallest positive numbers, or that negative numbers do not affect the range. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate the range, which is a fundamental concept in statistics and data analysis.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: When finding the range of a set of exam scores, a student ignores the scores that are below 0 (e.g. -5, -2) and only considers the positive scores (e.g. 10, 20, 30).
* Case 2: When analyzing temperature data, a student only considers the highest and lowest positive temperatures (e.g. 25°C and 5°C) and ignores the negative temperatures (e.g. -5°C, -10°C).
* Case 3: When calculating the range of a set of financial data, a student ignores the losses (negative numbers) and only considers the gains (positive numbers)."
1350,"When simplifying a ratio, divides one side of the ratio but multiplies the other side.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of equivalent ratios. They may believe that to simplify a ratio, they can perform different operations on each side, such as dividing one side while multiplying the other. This can lead to incorrect simplified ratios. For example, when simplifying the ratio 6:8, a student with this misconception may divide the first side by 2 (resulting in 3) while multiplying the second side by 2 (resulting in 16), yielding an incorrect simplified ratio of 3:16.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying ratios in recipe ingredients (e.g., scaling up or down a recipe).
- Comparing proportions in real-world applications (e.g., map scales, model sizes).
- Solving problems involving equivalent ratios in algebra (e.g., proportions, percentages).
- Interpreting data and statistics involving ratios (e.g., analyzing sports statistics, understanding survey results).
- Working with geometric shapes and scale factors (e.g., enlarging or reducing shapes while maintaining proportions)."
1351,Does not know the meaning of congruent,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unclear about the concept of congruent shapes or figures. They may mistakenly believe that congruent shapes are simply similar shapes or shapes that appear identical, but not necessarily having the same size. In reality, congruent shapes are identical in both shape and size. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in geometry, particularly when dealing with transformations, symmetry, and tessellations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When comparing two shapes with the same angles but different side lengths, students may incorrectly identify them as congruent.
2. When dealing with similar shapes, students might assume that similarity implies congruence, even if the shapes are different sizes.
3. When solving problems involving symmetry, students may mistakenly identify line symmetry or rotational symmetry as congruence.
4. When working with real-world applications, such as designing patterns or tiling, students may not recognize that congruent shapes are required for a seamless fit.
5. When solving problems involving transformations, such as translations, rotations, or reflections, students may not understand that the resulting shape must be congruent to the original shape."
1352,Believes cumulative frequency is plotted at the midpoint of the class,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that when constructing a cumulative frequency graph, the cumulative frequency values should be plotted at the midpoint of each class interval, similar to how they would plot the frequency values for a frequency polygon. However, in reality, the nature of cumulative frequency graphs requires a different approach to plotting the data points.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When constructing a cumulative frequency graph for a dataset with grouped data, students might instinctively plot the cumulative frequencies at the midpoint of each class interval, thinking it's the same as a frequency polygon.
- When dealing with a large dataset, students might find it difficult to determine where to plot the cumulative frequencies and default to plotting them at the midpoint, not realizing the error.
- In cases where the class intervals are not of equal width, plotting the cumulative frequencies at the midpoint can lead to an inaccurate representation of the data, but students might not recognize this issue.
- If students are using graphing software or calculators to construct the cumulative frequency graph, they might misinterpret the results or incorrectly input the data, leading to the misconception that the cumulative frequencies should be plotted at the midpoint."
1353,Believes two odd numbers multiply to give an even number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rule that ""an even number times any number is even"" or misunderstand the properties of odd numbers. They may incorrectly assume that the product of two odd numbers will result in an even number, possibly because they are confusing it with the rule for addition, where an odd number plus an odd number does indeed equal an even number. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Multiplying single-digit odd numbers: A student might think that 3 * 5 = 15 is an even number.
- Multiplying multi-digit odd numbers: A student might believe that 23 * 37 = 851 is an even number.
- Solving algebraic expressions: Given an expression like (2x + 1)(2x + 3), a student might assume that the product of the two odd terms will always be even.
- Real-world applications: When solving problems involving area or volume of shapes with odd dimensions, students might incorrectly assume that the result will always be an even number."
1354,Does not know how to calculate the position of a term in a sequence,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the relationship between the terms in a sequence and their corresponding positions. They may be unable to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence, leading to difficulties in determining the position of a specific term. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the sequence's structure, such as identifying whether it is an arithmetic or geometric sequence, or being unable to apply the relevant formulas to find the position of a term.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the 10th term in the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., a student may not know how to determine the position of the term.
- When given the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., a student may struggle to identify the position of the term 64.
- When asked to find the position of the term 25 in the sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ..., a student may not understand how to apply the sequence's rule to find the answer.
- When given a sequence with a more complex rule, such as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ..., a student may have difficulty identifying the pattern and finding the position of a specific term."
1355,Removes a zero from within the digits when rounding,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when rounding numbers, they can simply remove zeros from within the digits without considering the place value of the digit being rounded to. For example, when rounding 4050 to the nearest hundred, students with this misconception may incorrectly remove the zero and round it to 45 instead of the correct answer, 4100.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 3008 to the nearest thousand: students may round it to 38 instead of 3000.
- Rounding 2005 to the nearest hundred: students may round it to 25 instead of 2000.
- Rounding 9080 to the nearest thousand: students may round it to 98 instead of 9000.
- Rounding 15020 to the nearest ten thousand: students may round it to 152 instead of 20000."
1356,Confuses the use of LCM and HCF in real life examples ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the Least Common Multiple (LCM) and the Highest Common Factor (HCF) and apply them in real-life scenarios. They often get confused about whether to find the LCM or HCF in problems involving sharing, grouping, or comparing quantities. 

For instance, when dealing with questions like ""Tom has 12 apples and his friend has 18 apples, and they want to put them in boxes with equal numbers of apples,"" students might incorrectly use HCF instead of LCM to determine the number of apples in each box.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Arranging objects into groups with equal numbers (e.g., distributing pencils into boxes with the same number of pencils in each box).
- Case 2: Comparing the quantities of different items (e.g., comparing the number of wheels on different vehicles).
- Case 3: Sharing items equally among a group of people (e.g., dividing a bag of candies among friends).
- Case 4: Measuring ingredients for a recipe that needs to be scaled up or down.
- Case 5: Determining the number of items needed to create a pattern or design with equal intervals."
1357,Thinks only labelled dimensions need to be included when calculating the perimeter,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that only the dimensions or sides that are explicitly labelled or mentioned in a diagram or problem need to be considered when calculating the perimeter of a shape. They may overlook or ignore the unlabelled sides, assuming they are irrelevant to the calculation. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and an incomplete understanding of perimeter and its relationship to the shape's dimensions.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* A rectangle is drawn with only the length labelled, and the student only uses the labelled length to calculate the perimeter, ignoring the width.
* A diagram of a pentagon shows only three labelled sides, and the student calculates the perimeter using only those three sides, disregarding the two unlabelled sides.
* A word problem describes a garden bed with a labelled length and width, but the student only uses these labelled dimensions to calculate the perimeter, neglecting the other two sides that are not explicitly mentioned."
1358,Believes you can have decimals in a simplified fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a simplified fraction can contain decimal numbers. They might think that as long as the numerator and denominator are in their simplest form, the presence of decimals is acceptable. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly simplify fractions and provide answers with decimals, which is not a standard form of representing simplified fractions.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When simplifying a fraction with a decimal in the numerator or denominator, such as 2.5/5 or 3/2.5.
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, and the whole number part has a decimal, such as 2.5 3/4.
- When performing operations with fractions and the result has a decimal, such as adding 1/4 + 1/6 and getting 5/12.2.
- When converting between fractions and decimals, and students incorrectly assume that the decimal form is the simplified fraction form."
1359,Does not know how to round up when a decimal place value column contains a 9,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to round numbers to a specific decimal place, but they struggle with the rule when the digit in that decimal place is a 9. They may not understand that when the digit after the 9 is 5 or greater, the 9 should be rounded up to a 0 and the digit before the 9 should be increased by 1. This can lead to incorrect rounding and subsequent errors in calculations.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Rounding 4.99 to one decimal place (students may incorrectly round it to 4.9 instead of 5.0)
* Rounding 2.095 to two decimal places (students may incorrectly round it to 2.09 instead of 2.10)
* Rounding 7.49 to the nearest whole number (students may incorrectly round it to 7 instead of 7.5, and then not know how to round 7.5)
* Rounding 9.995 to three decimal places (students may incorrectly round it to 9.995 instead of 10.000)"
1360,"When solving an equation, multiplies instead of adding","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the operation required to solve an equation. They may incorrectly apply the multiplication operation instead of addition, often due to a misinterpretation of the equation's structure or a lack of understanding of the mathematical concept being represented.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with equations that involve multiple operations, such as 2x + 5 = 11, where the student may multiply 2x by 5 instead of adding 5 to 2x.
- When solving equations with negative numbers, such as x - 3 = 7, where the student may multiply x by -3 instead of adding 3 to x.
- When working with equations that involve fractions or decimals, such as 1/2x + 2 = 5, where the student may multiply 1/2x by 2 instead of adding 2 to 1/2x.
- When solving word problems that involve equations, such as ""Tom has 5 more books than twice the number of books his friend has,"" where the student may multiply the number of books by 5 instead of adding 5 to the result of doubling the number of books."
1361,Does not recognise that addition is the inverse operation of subtraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that addition and subtraction are related operations that ""undo"" each other. They may not recognize that adding a number can cancel out the effect of subtracting the same number, and vice versa. For example, if 5 is subtracted from a number and then 5 is added to the result, the original number is restored. 

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Difficulty in solving equations or word problems that involve both addition and subtraction, as they may not be able to identify the inverse relationship between the two operations.
- Struggling to check their calculations by using the inverse operation to verify their answers.
- Failing to recognize that subtraction can be used to find the difference between two numbers, and that adding the difference back to the smaller number will result in the larger number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to solve the equation 8 - 3 + 3 = ? and they fail to recognize that the +3 cancels out the -3.
- Case 2: A student is given a word problem where a character has 15 pencils, gives 4 to a friend, and then receives 4 more pencils as a gift. The student struggles to understand that the character now has the same number of pencils as before.
- Case 3: A student is asked to check their calculation for 9 - 4 = ? by using addition, but they are unable to do so because they don't understand the inverse relationship between addition and subtraction."
1362,Believes that the angle on a pie chart is the frequency multiplied by 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the angle of a sector in a pie chart is calculated by multiplying the frequency of the data by a fixed constant, in this case, 10. They may think that the size of the angle is directly proportional to the frequency, but misunderstand the actual method of calculation. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the frequency of data and the corresponding angle in a pie chart.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is creating a pie chart to represent the favorite colors of their classmates and thinks that if 5 students like the color blue, the angle for blue should be 50 degrees (5 x 10).
- A student is analyzing a pie chart showing the distribution of different types of fruits sold at a market and assumes that if 8 apples were sold, the angle for apples should be 80 degrees (8 x 10).
- A student is making a pie chart to display the results of a survey on how students travel to school and believes that if 12 students walk, the angle for walking should be 120 degrees (12 x 10)."
1363,Uses 2 letters to describe an angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that an angle can be represented by two letters, rather than three. In geometry, angles are typically denoted by three letters, with the middle letter representing the vertex of the angle. Students with this misconception may write angles as ""AB"" instead of the correct notation ""ABC"" or ""∠ABC"", where A and C are the endpoints of the arms of the angle, and B is the vertex. 

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are labeling angles in a diagram and only use two letters to describe the angle.
- When students are writing the measure of an angle and only use two letters to represent the angle, e.g., ""m∠AB = 30°"" instead of ""m∠ABC = 30°"".
- When students are solving problems involving angles in a geometric shape and incorrectly notate the angles with two letters, leading to confusion in their calculations."
1364,Believes the mode is the frequency rather than the value/group,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of mode in statistics. They tend to think that the mode is the frequency or the number of times an item appears in a dataset, rather than the actual value or group that appears most frequently. For example, if a dataset shows that 5 students scored 80 marks, 3 students scored 70 marks, and 2 students scored 90 marks, students with this misconception might say that the mode is 5 (the frequency) rather than 80 (the value that appears most frequently).

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When creating a bar graph to show the favorite colors of a class, a student might say the mode is 10 (the number of students who chose blue) rather than blue (the color itself).
- In a survey about the number of pets people own, a student might claim the mode is 15 (the number of people who own 2 pets) rather than 2 (the number of pets that appears most frequently).
- When analyzing a set of exam scores, a student might mistakenly say the mode is 8 (the number of students who scored 85) rather than 85 (the score that appears most frequently)."
1365,"When ordering integers, orders from the digits at the end of the number instead of the digits at the start","Explanation: This misconception arises when students focus on the last digit of a number when comparing and ordering integers, rather than considering the place value of each digit from left to right. They may believe that the number with the larger last digit is greater, regardless of the values of the preceding digits. For example, they might think that 123 is less than 102 because 3 is less than the last digit in the other number is not relevant in this comparison, 2 is the digit to be looked at first, then the 0 and 1, and then the 3.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Comparing numbers with different numbers of digits, e.g., 9 vs. 10, where the student might think 9 is greater because 9 is greater than 0.
- Ordering numbers with the same first digit but different subsequent digits, e.g., 150 vs. 105, where the student might think 150 is less than 105 because 0 is less than 5.
- Comparing numbers with different place values, e.g., 100 vs. 99, where the student might think 99 is greater because 9 is greater than 0."
1366,Subtracts instead of multiplies when using grid method,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are using the grid method to multiply two numbers, but instead of multiplying the numbers in each cell of the grid, they subtract them. The grid method is a visual representation of the multiplication process, where students break down the numbers into tens and ones, and then multiply each part separately. However, some students may mistakenly apply subtraction instead of multiplication, leading to incorrect results.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When multiplying two numbers with multiple digits, such as 43 x 27, students may set up the grid correctly but then subtract the numbers in each cell instead of multiplying them.
* When dealing with word problems that involve multiplication, such as ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils each"", students may use the grid method but apply subtraction instead of multiplication to find the total number of pencils.
* When multiplying decimals or fractions using the grid method, students may get confused and subtract the numbers instead of multiplying them, leading to incorrect results."
1367,Thinks a dashed line marking a region means the line is included,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret a dashed line marking the boundary of a region, such as in graphs or geometric shapes, as indicating that the line itself is included in the region. They may believe that the dashed line is part of the solution set or the area being measured. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations, interpretations, or conclusions in various mathematical contexts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Graphing inequalities: When graphing linear inequalities, a dashed line may be used to indicate the boundary. Students may incorrectly assume that the line itself is part of the solution set.
- Shading regions: In geometry, dashed lines may be used to mark the boundary of a region to be shaded. Students may mistakenly include the line in the shaded area.
- Calculating perimeter or area: When calculating the perimeter or area of a shape with a dashed boundary, students may incorrectly include the length of the dashed line in their calculations.
- Interpreting graphs: In data analysis, dashed lines may be used to indicate a boundary or threshold. Students may misinterpret the line as being part of the data set."
1368,Confuses parallel and transversal,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between parallel lines and transversals. They may incorrectly assume that any two lines that intersect another line are parallel, or that parallel lines always intersect. This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the definitions of parallel lines (lines that never intersect, no matter how far they are extended) and transversals (a line that intersects two or more other lines).

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Identifying two lines as parallel simply because they are both intersected by a third line (the transversal), without checking if they will ever intersect.
* Assuming that two lines that are not parallel will always intersect, even if they are not extended far enough.
* Difficulty identifying corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and alternate exterior angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A student is given a diagram with two lines intersected by a third line and asked to identify whether the two lines are parallel. The student incorrectly assumes they are parallel simply because they are both intersected by the third line.
* Case 2: A student is asked to draw two parallel lines and a transversal, but they draw two lines that intersect, claiming they are parallel because they ""look"" parallel.
* Case 3: A student is given a problem involving corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines, but they incorrectly identifies the angles as not corresponding because they don't understand the relationship between parallel lines and transversals."
1369,Halves the radius to find the diameter,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to find the diameter of a circle, they need to halve the radius, rather than doubling it. This error can stem from a misunderstanding of the relationship between the radius and diameter of a circle. Students may incorrectly assume that the diameter is a smaller unit of measurement than the radius, leading them to divide the radius by 2 instead of multiplying it by 2.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the diameter of a circle given its radius in a numerical problem.
- When students are working with real-world applications, such as measuring the diameter of a circular object, and they mistakenly use the radius as the larger unit of measurement.
- When students are solving problems involving circumference, area, or other circle-related calculations that require the use of diameter, and they incorrectly halve the radius instead of doubling it."
1370,Does not believe a shape can have two correct names e.g. rectangle and parallelogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a rigid understanding of shapes and their definitions, leading them to believe that a shape can only be classified under one specific name. They might think that a shape is either a rectangle or a parallelogram, but not both. This is likely due to the way they have been introduced to shapes, where each shape is presented as a distinct entity with its own set of characteristics.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When identifying a shape with four right angles and opposite sides of equal length, students might insist that it's only a rectangle, not a parallelogram, even though a rectangle meets the criteria for being a parallelogram (i.e., opposite sides are parallel).
- When asked to classify a shape with two pairs of parallel sides, students might argue that it's only a parallelogram and not a rectangle, even if the shape has four right angles.
- In a problem where students are asked to identify the properties of a shape, they might list the properties of a rectangle and a parallelogram as mutually exclusive, rather than recognizing that a shape can have properties of both."
1371,"When drawing bar diagram for ratio, shows the total as the difference between parts","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of ratio and its representation through bar diagrams. In a ratio, the total or whole is not necessarily the difference between the parts, but rather the sum of the parts. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that the total is the difference between the parts and draw the bar diagram accordingly.

For instance, if a ratio is 3:5, students may draw one bar of length 3 and another bar of length 5, and then assume that the total is the difference between the two parts (5 - 3 = 2) instead of the sum of the parts (3 + 5 = 8).

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the number of boys and girls in a class, students may draw a bar diagram showing the number of boys and girls and incorrectly label the total as the difference between the two numbers.
- When representing a recipe that requires a certain ratio of ingredients, students may draw a bar diagram showing the ratio of ingredients and incorrectly calculate the total amount of ingredients needed as the difference between the parts.
- When analyzing data on the number of hours spent on different activities, students may draw a bar diagram showing the number of hours spent on each activity and incorrectly calculate the total number of hours as the difference between the parts."
1372,Ordered from largest to smallest,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that negative numbers are larger than positive numbers because they have a larger absolute value or because of the misconception that the more digits a number has, the larger it is. This leads them to incorrectly order numbers, placing the negative numbers first when ordering from largest to smallest. 

For example, when ordering the numbers -10, 0, 5, and -20, students with this misconception may incorrectly order them as -20, -10, 5, 0, thinking that the negative numbers are larger.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- Comparing temperatures: Students might think -10°C is warmer than 0°C.
- Analyzing sea levels: Students might believe a depth of -50 meters is higher than 20 meters above sea level.
- Working with financial transactions: Students might think a loss of -$100 is more than a gain of $50.
- Plotting coordinates on a graph: Students might incorrectly place the point (-3, -4) above the point (2, 1)."
1373,Does not recognise a unit of time,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to understand and identify various units of time, such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. They may not comprehend the relationships between these units, leading to difficulties in converting between them or understanding time-related concepts. This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Not understanding that there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, 60 minutes in 1 hour, or 24 hours in a day.
- Struggling to convert between units of time, such as converting hours to minutes or days to weeks.
- Having trouble telling time on an analog clock, understanding the concept of half past, quarter to, or quarter past.
- Not recognizing that time can be measured in different units, such as milliseconds or centuries.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to convert 3 hours to minutes, a student responds with 100 minutes instead of 180 minutes.
- A student is asked to tell the time on an analog clock showing 9:45 and responds with 9:50.
- When asked how many days are in a week, a student responds with 8 or 10 instead of 7.
- A student is asked to calculate the duration of an event that started at 10:00 AM and ended at 12:30 PM, and they respond with 1 hour instead of 2.5 hours."
1374,"When multiplying fractions, multiplies the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions. They may think that multiplying fractions involves multiplying both the numerators and the denominators separately, just like adding or subtracting fractions with like denominators. However, when multiplying fractions, students mistakenly multiply the denominators together, instead of multiplying the numerators together to get the new numerator and multiplying the denominators together to get the new denominator.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Multiplying two simple fractions: When asked to multiply 1/2 and 1/3, a student with this misconception may multiply the denominators (2 * 3 = 6) and write the answer as 1/6 or 2/6, instead of correctly multiplying the numerators (1 * 1 = 1) and the denominators (2 * 3 = 6) to get 1/6.
2. Multiplying fractions with different denominators: If asked to multiply 2/3 and 3/4, a student may incorrectly multiply the denominators (3 * 4 = 12) and write the answer as 2/12 or 3/12 or 5/12 or 6/12, instead of correctly multiplying the numerators (2 * 3 = 6) and the denominators (3 * 4 = 12) to get 6/12.
3. Word problems involving multiplying fractions: When solving a word problem, such as ""A recipe calls for 1/2 cup of sugar. If you want to make 1/3 of the recipe, how much sugar do you need?"", a student with this misconception may incorrectly multiply the denominators to find the answer, instead of correctly multiplying the fractions."
1375,Confuses the radius and theta when working with sectors ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with sectors in geometry, particularly when dealing with calculations involving the area, perimeter, or arc length of a sector. Students may confuse the radius (the distance from the center of the circle to the edge of the sector) with theta (the central angle of the sector, measured in degrees or radians). 

This confusion may lead students to incorrectly plug in values or use the wrong formula, resulting in incorrect calculations. For instance, they may mistakenly use the radius in place of theta or vice versa, or they may misunderstand the relationship between the radius, theta, and the arc length or area of the sector.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When calculating the area of a sector, students may incorrectly use the formula A = (theta/360) * pi * r, where they confuse the radius with theta or vice versa.
- When finding the arc length of a sector, students may mistakenly use the formula L = r * theta, but incorrectly substitute the values of r and theta.
- When comparing different sectors, students may incorrectly assume that a sector with a larger radius will always have a larger area or arc length, without considering the effect of theta.
- When working with real-world problems involving sectors, such as designing circular paths or modeling circular motion, students may confuse the radius and theta, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
1376,Thinks that a larger shaded area represents a larger fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the size of a shaded area directly corresponds to the size of a fraction, without considering the total number of equal parts or the denominator. They may think that a larger shaded area automatically represents a larger fraction, regardless of the total number of parts the whole is divided into. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect comparisons and ordering of fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Comparing 1/2 and 2/4, where the student might think 2/4 is larger because it has more shaded parts, not realizing that both fractions are equal.
- Case 2: Comparing 1/4 and 1/2, where the student might draw a larger shaded area for 1/4, making it appear larger than 1/2.
- Case 3: Ordering fractions such as 1/2, 1/4, and 3/4, where the student might arrange them in order of the size of their shaded areas rather than their actual values."
1377,Square roots when asked for second multiple,"Explanation: A common misconception students have is that when they're asked to find a second or multiple square roots of a number, they only consider the positive square root and either ignore or are unaware of the negative square root. This misconception arises because, in some contexts, only the positive square root is relevant or needed, leading students to generalize this and overlook the possibility of negative square roots in other situations.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When solving quadratic equations, students might only consider the positive square root of the discriminant, potentially missing a valid solution.
- In algebraic manipulations, students might simplify expressions involving square roots by only considering the positive square root, which could lead to incomplete or incorrect solutions.
- In geometric contexts, such as finding the side length of a square given its area, students might only consider the positive square root, neglecting the possibility of a negative side length (although this might not be physically meaningful in some contexts, it's still mathematically relevant).
- In problems involving functions, such as graphing or analyzing square root functions, students might only consider the positive square root, missing important characteristics or features of the function."
1378,"When solving a problem using written division (bus-stop method), carries the wrong digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing written division using the bus-stop method and they incorrectly identify the digit to be carried from one step of the division to the next. This can occur when students are dividing multi-digit numbers and are required to subtract a number from a digit that is smaller than the number being subtracted, requiring them to ""borrow"" or ""carry"" a digit from the next place value.

For example, this misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dividing 432 by 6, a student might incorrectly carry a 0 instead of a 1 from the tens place, resulting in an incorrect calculation.
- When dividing 945 by 5, a student might incorrectly carry a 4 instead of an 8 from the hundreds place, resulting in an incorrect calculation.
- When dividing 216 by 3, a student might incorrectly carry a 1 instead of a 2 from the tens place, resulting in an incorrect calculation."
1379,Rounds down instead of up,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers to a specific place value or decimal place, but they consistently round down instead of up when the digit to be rounded is exactly halfway between two numbers. For example, when rounding 3.5 to the nearest whole number, students with this misconception may incorrectly round it down to 3 instead of up to 4.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Rounding 2.5 to the nearest whole number (rounding down to 2 instead of up to 3)
* Rounding 4.5 kg to the nearest kilogram (rounding down to 4 kg instead of up to 5 kg)
* Rounding £5.50 to the nearest pound (rounding down to £5 instead of up to £6)
* Rounding 12.5 cm to the nearest centimeter (rounding down to 12 cm instead of up to 13 cm)
* Rounding 7.5 to the nearest whole number in a mathematical calculation (rounding down to 7 instead of up to 8)"
1380,"When collecting like terms, assigns positivity or negativity incorrectly.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly assign positivity or negativity to terms while collecting like terms in an algebraic expression. They may incorrectly assume that the sign in front of a term only applies to the number immediately following it, rather than to the entire term. For example, when collecting like terms in the expression 3x - 2x + 5 - 3, students may think that the negative sign in front of the 2x only applies to the 2, and not to the x as well.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly combine terms, resulting in incorrect simplified expressions. It can also cause them to become confused when dealing with expressions that involve multiple negative signs or subtraction of terms.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Simplifying the expression 2x - 3x + 4, where students may think that the negative sign only applies to the 3, and not to the x.
- Case 2: Combining like terms in the expression x - 2x - 5, where students may incorrectly assign positivity to the 2x term.
- Case 3: Simplifying the expression 4x + 2 - 3x - 1, where students may get confused with the multiple negative signs and incorrectly combine the terms."
1381,Believes the gradient is where the line intersects the y axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the concept of the y-intercept with the gradient of a line. They mistakenly believe that the gradient of a line is the point at which it intersects the y-axis, rather than understanding that the gradient represents the rate of change of the line. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of linear equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the gradient of a line from a graph, students may give the y-intercept as the answer.
- When given the equation of a line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), students may identify the constant term (c) as the gradient instead of the coefficient of x (m).
- When asked to draw a line with a specific gradient, students may draw a line that intersects the y-axis at the given value, rather than drawing a line with the correct slope."
1382,"When given two similar objects and asked to find the length scale factor, believes the length scale factor is the area scale factor","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to differentiate between the concept of length scale factor and area scale factor. They mistakenly assume that if two objects are similar and one object's dimensions are multiplied by a certain factor to obtain the dimensions of the other object, then the same factor applies to both the length and area of the objects. In other words, students incorrectly believe that the scale factor that describes the relationship between the lengths of corresponding sides of similar figures also describes the relationship between their areas.

This misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the areas of two similar shapes, such as two similar triangles or two similar circles, and the student uses the length scale factor to calculate the area of the larger shape.
- When working with real-world applications, such as scaling up or down a design, and the student fails to recognize that the area scale factor is the square of the length scale factor.
- When solving problems involving similar 2D or 3D shapes, and the student incorrectly applies the length scale factor to find the area or volume of the larger shape."
1383,"When two digits sum to 10 or more during an addition problem, does not add one to the preceding digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing addition problems and two digits in the same place value position sum to 10 or more. The students may write the last digit of the sum but fail to carry over the extra value to the preceding digit. For example, when adding 7 and 4 in the ones place, the student may write 1 as the ones digit but fail to carry over the 1 to the tens place.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* 45 + 27: The student may add 5 and 7 to get 12 but fail to carry over the 1 to the tens place.
* 93 + 18: The student may add 3 and 8 to get 11 but fail to carry over the 1 to the tens place.
* 145 + 79: The student may add 5 and 9 to get 14 but fail to carry over the 1 to the hundreds place.
* 25 + 86: The student may add 5 and 6 to get 11 but fail to carry over the 1 to the tens place."
1384,"When reading decimals on a number line, assumes each dash is 0.5","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to number lines with decimal values. They may mistakenly believe that each dash or mark on the number line represents an increment of 0.5, rather than understanding that the spacing between the marks can vary depending on the scale of the number line. For example, if a number line has marks at 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, etc., a student with this misconception may think that the first mark after 0 represents 0.5, rather than 0.2.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When a student is asked to identify the value of a point on a number line that is halfway between two whole numbers, they may assume it is always 0.5, regardless of the actual scale.
- When comparing the values of two decimal numbers on a number line, a student with this misconception may incorrectly determine which number is greater or lesser.
- When plotting decimal values on a number line, a student may place the points at incorrect locations, leading to errors in their understanding of number relationships and patterns.
- When solving problems that involve measuring lengths or distances using a number line, a student with this misconception may arrive at incorrect answers due to their misunderstanding of the scale."
1385,Struggles to draw 3D shapes on isometric paper,"Explanation: Students may struggle to draw 3D shapes on isometric paper due to a misconception that isometric drawings are the same as perspective drawings or that the measurements and proportions used in isometric drawings are the same as those in regular 2D drawings. They may not fully understand that isometric drawings are a way to represent 3D objects in a 2D format, using 120-degree angles to create a more accurate representation of the object's dimensions.

They may also have difficulty visualizing the 3D shape and translating it onto the isometric paper, often resulting in distorted or inaccurate drawings. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the 3D object and its 2D representation or an inability to break down the object into its individual components and draw each part separately.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* When asked to draw a cube or a rectangular prism on isometric paper, students may draw it with unequal sides or distorted angles.
* When trying to draw a more complex 3D shape, such as a triangular prism or a pyramid, students may become confused about how to represent the different faces and edges of the shape.
* When given a real-world object to draw isometrically, students may struggle to break it down into its individual components and represent it accurately on the paper."
1386,Confuses the method for finding the gradient and length of a line segment,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mix up the formulas for finding the gradient (slope) of a line and the length of a line segment. They might use the formula for the length of a line segment (e.g., using the distance formula) to find the gradient, or vice versa. This confusion can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of the fundamental concepts in geometry.

For example, given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), students might incorrectly use the distance formula (sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)) to find the gradient of the line instead of using the correct formula (gradient = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)).

This misconception can occur in the following short cases:

- When finding the equation of a line given two points
- When determining the steepness of a line in a graph
- When solving problems involving right-angled triangles and line segments
- When interpreting the slope of a line in a real-world context (e.g., the slope of a roof or a hill)"
1387,Does not understand the effect of consecutive subtractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that consecutive subtractions can be represented as a single subtraction or an addition problem with the opposite sign. They may struggle to understand that subtracting a negative number is equivalent to adding a positive number. For example, the problem 10 - (-3) may be confusing for them, as they may not realize that subtracting a negative number is the same as adding 3.

This misconception can also lead to difficulties when dealing with problems that involve multiple subtractions, such as 10 - 3 - 2. Students may not understand that this is equivalent to 10 - (3 + 2), and may arrive at incorrect answers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A temperature of 5°C dropped by 2°C and then dropped by another 3°C.
- A person has $15, spends $3, and then loses $2 more.
- A water tank contains 1000 liters of water, 300 liters are drained, and then another 200 liters are drained."
1388,Does not understand the term quadratic,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of quadratic equations and expressions, but struggle to grasp the meaning and application of the term ""quadratic."" They may think that a quadratic is simply an equation with a squared variable, without understanding the specific form and characteristics that define a quadratic equation. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in identifying, solving, and graphing quadratic equations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify whether an equation is quadratic or not, they may incorrectly identify equations such as x^3 + 2x^2 as quadratic, simply because they see a squared term.
* When solving quadratic equations, students may attempt to use linear methods, such as adding or subtracting the same value to both sides, rather than using specific quadratic techniques, such as factoring or the quadratic formula.
* When graphing quadratic functions, students may expect the graph to be a straight line, rather than a parabola, due to their misunderstanding of the quadratic form.
* When faced with real-world problems that involve quadratic relationships, such as projectile motion or optimization problems, students may struggle to recognize the quadratic nature of the problem and apply the relevant mathematical techniques."
1389,Mistakes lines as parallel,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify two lines as parallel when they are not. Students may believe that lines are parallel if they appear to be close together, are the same length, or have a similar orientation on a page, without considering their actual relationship in terms of angles and slopes. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definition of parallel lines, which states that two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope and never intersect.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When two lines are close together and appear to be ""almost"" parallel, students may mistakenly assume they are parallel.
2. When two lines have the same length and orientation on a page, students may believe they are parallel without checking their slopes.
3. When two lines intersect at a very small angle, students may mistakenly think they are parallel.
4. When students are given a diagram with multiple lines and are asked to identify which ones are parallel, they may rely on visual appearance rather than checking the slopes of the lines.
5. When students are working with real-world examples, such as railroad tracks or building designs, they may assume lines are parallel without considering the actual geometry of the situation."
1390,Believes having the gradient and y-intercept is not enough information to write an equation for a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to connect the concept of the gradient-intercept form of a linear equation (y = mx + c) to the information provided about the gradient (m) and the y-intercept (c). They may believe that additional information, such as the x-intercept or another point on the line, is necessary to write the equation of the line.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When given a word problem that provides the gradient and y-intercept of a line, but the student is unsure how to use this information to write the equation.
* When graphing a line and the student knows the gradient and y-intercept, but doesn't realize that this is enough information to write the equation of the line.
* When solving a system of linear equations and the student is given the gradient and y-intercept of one of the lines, but is unsure how to use this information to write the equation of that line.
* When asked to find the equation of a line that passes through a given point and has a given gradient, and the student believes that they need more information about the line.
* When working with real-world applications, such as the cost of goods or services, and the student is given the rate of change (gradient) and the initial value (y-intercept), but is unsure how to use this information to write the equation of the line."
1391,Does not know how to find the y intercept when given two other sets of coordinates that lie on a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given two points on a line and are asked to find the y-intercept, but they do not understand how to use the information provided to calculate it. They may struggle to apply the slope-intercept form of a linear equation (y = mx + b) or may not know how to use the coordinates of the two points to find the slope and then the y-intercept.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Case 1: When given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) on a line and asked to find the y-intercept, the student may try to find the y-intercept by simply averaging the y-coordinates of the two points or by trying to find the midpoint of the two points.
* Case 2: When given a graph of a line with two points marked on it and asked to find the y-intercept, the student may try to estimate the y-intercept by looking at the graph, but not know how to use the coordinates of the two points to calculate it accurately.
* Case 3: When given a word problem that involves finding the y-intercept of a line, such as finding the initial cost of a service that has a linear cost function, the student may not know how to apply the mathematical concept of y-intercept to solve the problem."
1392,Does not include brackets when required,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize the importance of brackets in mathematical expressions, particularly in Algebra and Number. They may not understand that brackets are used to group numbers or operations together, indicating that the operations within the brackets should be performed first. As a result, they may write expressions without brackets, leading to incorrect calculations and ambiguous interpretations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions with multiple operations, such as 3 × 2 + 10 - 5, students may not use brackets to clarify the order of operations.
- When working with algebraic expressions, such as 2(x + 3), students may omit the brackets, writing the expression as 2x + 3, which changes the meaning of the expression.
- When solving equations, such as 2x + 5 = 11, students may not use brackets to isolate the variable, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with mathematical formulas, such as the formula for the area of a rectangle (length × width), students may not use brackets to group the variables, leading to incorrect calculations."
1393,Does not know that a single letter labels a vertex,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the convention of labeling vertices in geometry, particularly in the context of shapes and graphs. They may believe that a single letter is insufficient to identify a specific point or vertex, or that it needs to be accompanied by other letters or symbols. This misunderstanding can lead to confusion when working with geometric shapes, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons, where vertices are typically labeled with single letters.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* When asked to label the vertices of a triangle, a student might use a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., A1, B2, C3) instead of single letters (e.g., A, B, C).
* When working with a diagram of a polygon, a student might label each vertex with a phrase or a sentence instead of a single letter.
* When given a graph with multiple vertices, a student might use different symbols or colors to label each vertex instead of using single letters."
1394,Identifies the first term rather than the next term in a sequence,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify the next term in a sequence, but instead, they identify the first term of the sequence. This shows a lack of understanding of the pattern or rule governing the sequence, and an inability to apply it to generate the next term. Students may be focusing too much on the starting point of the sequence rather than analyzing the relationship between consecutive terms.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When dealing with simple arithmetic sequences, like 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., and the student identifies 2 as the next term instead of the actual next term.
* When working with geometric sequences, like 3, 6, 12, 24, ..., and the student identifies 3 as the next term instead of the actual next term.
* When identifying patterns in shapes or colors, and the student points to the first shape or color instead of the next one in the sequence.
* When solving problems that involve recursive sequences, and the student fails to apply the recursive rule to find the next term.
* When analyzing real-world data that follows a sequential pattern, such as population growth or temperature changes, and the student mistakenly identifies the starting point of the sequence instead of forecasting the next value."
1395,"When calculating volume expressed in cubes, counts the visible cubes only","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the volume of a 3D shape made up of cubes. They tend to count only the cubes that are visible from the outside, neglecting the hidden cubes inside the shape. This is likely due to their inability to visualize the internal structure of the shape or their lack of understanding of the concept of volume as the amount of space occupied by a 3D object.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When finding the volume of a rectangular prism made up of cubes, students may only count the cubes on the surface, ignoring the cubes inside.
* When calculating the volume of a cube-based structure with holes or gaps, students might only count the visible cubes and not account for the empty spaces.
* When working with 3D shapes composed of multiple layers of cubes, students may only consider the cubes on the outermost layer and neglect the cubes in the inner layers."
1396,Finds a percentage when asked for a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to express a part of a whole as a fraction, but instead, they provide the answer as a percentage. This is likely due to the fact that percentages are often used in real-life applications, and students may be more familiar with finding percentages rather than equivalent fractions. As a result, when asked to find a fraction, they may mistakenly calculate the percentage and provide that as their answer.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the fraction of a pizza that has been eaten, a student may respond with ""25%"" instead of ""1/4"".
- When asked to express the ratio of boys to girls in a class as a fraction, a student may answer ""60%"" instead of ""3/5"".
- When asked to find the fraction of a tank that is filled with water, a student may respond with ""75%"" instead of ""3/4"".
- When asked to express a probability as a fraction, a student may answer ""20%"" instead of ""1/5""."
1397,Believes point will move diagonally when reflecting in a horizontal or vertical line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reflection in geometry. They may think that when a point is reflected in a horizontal or vertical line, it will move diagonally to a new position, rather than moving perpendicular to the line of reflection. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the properties of reflections, or a failure to visualize the movement of the point in relation to the line of reflection.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to reflect a point (e.g., (2,3)) in a horizontal line (e.g., x-axis), a student with this misconception may plot the reflected point at a position that is diagonally opposite the original point, such as (3,2) or (-2,-3), instead of the correct position (2,-3).
* When reflecting a shape (e.g., a triangle) in a vertical line (e.g., y-axis), a student with this misconception may draw the reflected shape with diagonal, rather than horizontal or vertical, movement.
* When solving problems involving reflections in coordinate geometry, a student with this misconception may calculate the reflected coordinates incorrectly, leading to incorrect answers."
1398,Divided by 100 rather than 1000,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are converting between units, particularly in measurement and money problems. They may mistakenly think that to convert a quantity from a larger unit to a smaller unit, they need to divide by 100 rather than 1000. For example, when converting from kilograms to grams or from liters to milliliters, students with this misconception may divide by 100 instead of 1000, resulting in incorrect answers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Converting 1 kilogram to grams: A student may think 1 kilogram is equal to 10 grams (1,000 grams / 100) instead of 1,000 grams.
* Converting 1 liter to milliliters: A student may think 1 liter is equal to 10 milliliters (1,000 milliliters / 100) instead of 1,000 milliliters.
* Converting 1 meter to millimeters: A student may think 1 meter is equal to 10 millimeters (1,000 millimeters / 100) instead of 1,000 millimeters.
* Converting money: A student may think $1 is equal to 10 cents (100 cents / 10 or $1/ 0.1 of a dollar) when actually using the same logic ($1/ 0.01 of a dollar or 100 cents / 100) but dividing by 100 rather than using 100 cents equal to a dollar to change to 1000 cents in total, but as the value 1000 is 10 times bigger than 100 the $1 would be 10 times less than 1000 in value so $1 = 1000 / 10 = $1 = 100 cents which students may forget to use conversion of 1000 being divided by 100 in real-life situations such as $1 being equal to 100 cents or 1000 being equal to $10 and so dividing by 10 in conversion of 1000."
1399,Fails to identify any rotational symmetry ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to recognize or identify the rotational symmetry of a shape. Rotational symmetry refers to the number of times a shape can be rotated around a central point and still look the same. Students with this misconception may not be able to determine the order of rotational symmetry or may incorrectly identify the number of times a shape can be rotated.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the number of rotational symmetries of a regular hexagon, a student may respond with ""none"" or ""1"", failing to recognize that it has 6-fold rotational symmetry.
- When presented with a shape that has a combination of line and rotational symmetries, a student may only identify the line symmetries and neglect to consider rotational symmetries.
- When given a shape with a non-standard orientation, a student may struggle to recognize its rotational symmetries, such as a square rotated 45 degrees from its usual position.
- When asked to create a shape with a specific number of rotational symmetries, a student may produce a shape that does not meet the criteria, demonstrating their lack of understanding of rotational symmetry."
1400,Believes dividing a negative by a negative gives a negative answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing negative numbers. They might think that because a negative number is involved, the result must also be negative. They may not fully understand the rule that when dividing two negative numbers, the result is actually a positive number. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of concrete visual representations or real-world examples to illustrate this concept.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Dividing -6 by -2, and thinking the result is -3 instead of 3.
- Simplifying the expression -12 ÷ -4, and believing the answer is -3 instead of 3.
- Solving the equation -x = -8, and when dividing both sides by -1, thinking x = -8 instead of x = 8."
1401,Believes the sin graph relates to the cos function,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the sine (sin) graph has a direct relationship with the cosine (cos) function, possibly thinking they are interchangeable or mirror images of each other without understanding the actual phase shift between them. They may incorrectly assume that the graphs of sin(x) and cos(x) are identical, failing to recognize that the cosine graph is actually a 90-degree (π/2 radians) phase shift of the sine graph.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to graph the sine function, students might produce the graph of the cosine function instead, or vice versa.
- When solving trigonometric equations involving sine and cosine, students may incorrectly substitute one function for the other, leading to incorrect solutions.
- In problems involving the application of trigonometric identities, such as sin(x) = cos(π/2 - x), students may not understand the underlying relationship between sine and cosine and misapply the identities.
- When analyzing real-world phenomena, such as wave patterns, students may misinterpret the phase shift between sine and cosine functions, leading to incorrect conclusions about the phenomena being modeled."
1402,Rounds down instead of up when next digit is 5,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are taught to round numbers, but they consistently round down when the next digit is 5, instead of rounding up as the standard convention dictates. This misunderstanding may stem from the student's prior experiences or a lack of clear explanation of the rounding rules. As a result, whenever the digit to be rounded is followed by a 5, the student will incorrectly round down, potentially leading to inaccuracies in calculations.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 4.5 to the nearest whole number (student will answer 4 instead of 5)
- Rounding 12.5 to the nearest whole number (student will answer 12 instead of 13)
- Rounding 7.55 to one decimal place (student will answer 7.5 instead of 7.6)"
1403,"When two digits multiply to 10 or more during a multiplication problem, does not add carried value to the preceding digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing multiplication calculations involving two or more digits. When multiplying two digits results in a product of 10 or more, the student fails to recognize that the tens digit of the product should be carried over and added to the preceding digit. Instead, they might simply write the ones digit of the product and ignore the tens digit, leading to an incorrect calculation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying 43 and 7, the student calculates 3 x 7 = 21, but fails to add the 2 to the product of 40 and 7.
- Multiplying 94 and 5, the student calculates 4 x 5 = 20, but fails to add the 2 to the product of 90 and 5.
- Multiplying 17 and 8, the student calculates 7 x 8 = 56, but fails to add the 5 to the product of 10 and 8."
1404,"Believes that when multiplying an integer by a decimal greater than 1, you multiply by the integer component of the decimal but add on the decimal component multiplied by 10.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying integers by decimals. They may think that when multiplying an integer by a decimal greater than 1, they need to separate the integer part from the decimal part of the multiplier. They then multiply the original integer by the integer part of the decimal, and add on the decimal part multiplied by 10. 

For example, if the problem is 4 × 3.7, a student with this misconception may calculate it as: 4 × 3 = 12, then 0.7 × 10 = 7, and finally add 12 + 7 to get 19. This is an incorrect understanding of the multiplication process, which can lead to incorrect results.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- 5 × 2.8: A student may calculate 5 × 2 = 10 and 0.8 × 10 = 8, resulting in an answer of 18.
- 6 × 4.2: A student may calculate 6 × 4 = 24 and 0.2 × 10 = 2, resulting in an answer of 26.
- 3 × 2.5: A student may calculate 3 × 2 = 6 and 0.5 × 10 = 5, resulting in an answer of 11."
1405,Cannot accurately estimate capacity,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to make accurate estimations of the capacity or volume of various containers or objects. They may have difficulty visualizing the relationships between different units of measurement, such as milliliters (mL) and liters (L), or understanding the concept of capacity in relation to real-life objects. As a result, they may make inaccurate estimates, for example, thinking that a small container holds more liquid than it actually does or underestimating the capacity of a larger container.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. **Comparing containers**: When asked to compare the capacity of two containers, students may incorrectly estimate that a taller, thinner container holds more liquid than a shorter, wider container, even if the shorter container has a larger capacity.
2. **Measuring liquids**: When asked to measure a certain amount of liquid, students may over- or under-estimate the capacity of the measuring cup or container, leading to inaccurate measurements.
3. **Real-life applications**: When faced with real-life scenarios, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or estimating the amount of water needed to fill a pool, students may struggle to make accurate estimates of capacity, leading to errors or miscalculations.
4. **Converting units**: When converting between units of measurement, such as from milliliters to liters, students may make mistakes due to a lack of understanding of the relationships between the units, leading to inaccurate estimates of capacity."
1406,Does not recognise that interior and exterior angles are supplementary,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand the relationship between interior and exterior angles of a polygon. They may believe that interior and exterior angles are separate entities without any connection, or that they have a different relationship, such as being equal or having a fixed difference. 

This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definition of supplementary angles (angles that add up to 180 degrees) or a failure to visualize how interior and exterior angles are related.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the measure of an exterior angle of a polygon given the measure of its interior angle, a student with this misconception may not know how to proceed.
- When tasked with calculating the sum of the interior angles of a polygon and given information about the exterior angles, a student may not recognize the relationship between the two.
- When solving problems involving the angles of a polygon, such as finding the number of sides or the measure of a specific angle, a student with this misconception may arrive at incorrect answers due to their failure to account for the supplementary relationship between interior and exterior angles."
1407,Confuses histograms with bar charts,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between the purposes and characteristics of histograms and bar charts. They may incorrectly assume that both types of graphs are used for the same purpose, or they may incorrectly choose one type of graph over the other for a particular set of data. 

Histograms and bar charts are both graphical representations of data, but they are used in different contexts and have distinct features. However, students may struggle to identify these differences, leading to confusion between the two. This misconception can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the fundamental principles of each type of graph and when they should be used.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to create a graph to display the number of students in each year group at school. They incorrectly choose to create a histogram instead of a bar chart, as they do not understand that histograms are typically used for continuous data.
- Case 2: A student is given a set of continuous data, such as exam scores, and is asked to create a graph to display the distribution of the scores. They incorrectly choose to create a bar chart instead of a histogram, as they do not understand that histograms are better suited for continuous data.
- Case 3: A student is shown a graph and asked to identify whether it is a histogram or a bar chart. They incorrectly identify the graph due to a lack of understanding of the defining features of each type of graph."
1408,Does not realise that adding a larger number gives a larger answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental concept of addition and its relationship with the size of the numbers being added. They may believe that the order or size of the numbers does not affect the result of the addition, or that adding a larger number will not necessarily result in a larger answer. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of basic arithmetic operations.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When comparing the results of adding different numbers, e.g., 2 + 3 vs. 2 + 5, where the student may think the results are equal or unrelated to the size of the numbers.
* When solving simple story problems, e.g., ""If I have 5 pencils and I get 2 more, and my friend has 5 pencils and gets 4 more, who has more pencils now?""
* When completing basic addition exercises, e.g., filling in missing numbers in simple addition equations, where the student may write incorrect answers due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the numbers being added."
1409,Confuses 'and' with 'or' in probability,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the meaning of the words 'and' and 'or' in probability problems, leading to incorrect calculations. In probability, 'and' is used to find the probability of two or more events happening together, whereas 'or' is used to find the probability of at least one of the events occurring. Students with this misconception might multiply probabilities when they should be adding them, or vice versa.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- A coin is flipped twice. What is the probability that it lands heads on the first flip and tails on the second flip? (Students might add the probabilities instead of multiplying.)
- A deck of cards is shuffled, and a card is drawn. What is the probability that it is a heart or a diamond? (Students might multiply the probabilities instead of adding and adjusting for the overlap.)
- A spinner has four equal sections: red, blue, green, and yellow. What is the probability that it lands on red or green? (Students might multiply the probabilities instead of adding.)
- A dice is rolled twice. What is the probability that it lands on 6 on the first roll and 3 on the second roll? (Students might add the probabilities instead of multiplying.)"
1410,Believes to find the next traingle number you add the previous two numbers together i.e. Fibonacci,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the concept of the Fibonacci sequence to find the next triangle number. They believe that adding the previous two numbers in the sequence will give them the next triangle number. This misunderstanding likely stems from the fact that both sequences involve adding numbers to get the next term, but the underlying pattern and formula are different. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to triangle numbers and are not clear about the formula or pattern used to generate them.
- When students are familiar with the Fibonacci sequence and try to apply its pattern to other number sequences, including triangle numbers.
- When students are given a sequence of numbers and are asked to identify the pattern or find the next term without clear guidance or understanding of the underlying formula.
- When students are working with sequences that involve adding numbers, but are not paying close attention to the specific pattern or formula being used."
1411,Describes term to term rules using position to term rules,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly describe a sequence using a position-to-term rule, instead of a term-to-term rule. A position-to-term rule describes a sequence by defining the value of each term based on its position in the sequence, whereas a term-to-term rule describes a sequence by defining how each term is obtained from the previous term.

In this misconception, students may incorrectly describe a sequence by giving a formula or rule that defines the value of each term based on its position, rather than describing how each term is obtained from the previous term.

For example, consider the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14...

A student with this misconception may describe the sequence using the position-to-term rule: ""The nth term is 3n - 1"", instead of using the term-to-term rule: ""Each term is obtained by adding 3 to the previous term"".

This misconception can lead to difficulties when working with sequences, as students may struggle to identify the underlying pattern or rule governing the sequence.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Describing the sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...
- Describing the sequence of multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20...
- Describing a sequence of numbers that increase by a fixed constant: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14...
- Describing a sequence of numbers that decrease by a fixed constant: 10, 7, 4, 1, -2..."
1412,Believes y=f(-x) is a reflection in y=x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a function f(x) across the line y=x will result in the function y=f(-x). However, reflecting a function f(x) across the line y=x actually results in the function x=f(y), not y=f(-x). The function y=f(-x) is actually a reflection of f(x) across the y-axis. This misconception shows a misunderstanding of function transformations and reflections in the coordinate plane.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When graphing functions and their reflections.
- When solving problems involving transformations of functions.
- When analyzing the symmetry of functions.
- When comparing the graphs of related functions, such as f(x) and f(-x).
- When interpreting the effects of reflections on function graphs in real-world applications."
1413,Assumes the negative sign in a power has no meaning,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with negative exponents and they tend to ignore the negative sign or misunderstand its significance. They may think that the negative sign is simply indicating a negative number, rather than understanding that it actually means taking the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive power. This can lead to incorrect simplifications and calculations when working with expressions involving negative exponents.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying expressions with negative exponents, such as 2^(-3) or 1/2^(-2).
- Solving equations involving negative exponents, like 2^(-x) = 4.
- Working with scientific notation and dealing with negative exponents, for example, 1.2 x 10^(-5).
- Manipulating algebraic expressions with negative exponents, such as (x^(-2) + 3x^(-1)) / 2.
- Graphing functions with negative exponents, like y = 2^(-x) and not understanding how the negative exponent affects the shape of the graph."
1414,Believes instant change of velocity is possible. ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that an object can change its velocity instantly, without any time passing. They may think that an object can immediately change from one speed to another, or from rest to motion, without any acceleration or deceleration. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of acceleration and the relationship between velocity and time.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing the motion of an object in a physics or mathematics problem, students may assume that the object can instantly change its velocity in response to a force or other external factor.
- When graphing the motion of an object, students may draw a graph with instantaneous changes in velocity, rather than showing a smooth curve that represents the object's acceleration or deceleration.
- When solving problems involving motion, students may calculate the final velocity of an object without considering the time it takes to reach that velocity, leading to incorrect answers.
- When considering real-world scenarios, such as the motion of a car or a thrown ball, students may assume that the object can instantly change its velocity, rather than understanding that it takes time for the object to accelerate or decelerate."
1415,Assumes every dash on a scale represents an increase of 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that every dash or mark on a scale represents a consistent increase of 1 unit, regardless of the actual scale's interval or labeling. They may overlook or misunderstand the scale's markings, leading to incorrect measurements or interpretations.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* Reading temperatures on a thermometer: A student might assume that every dash represents a 1-degree increase, even if the scale is marked in increments of 5 or 10 degrees.
* Measuring lengths on a ruler: A student may think that every dash represents 1 centimeter or 1 inch, without noticing that the ruler is marked in increments of 0.5 or 2 units.
* Interpreting data on a graph: A student might assume that every dash on the axis represents a 1-unit increase, even if the axis is labeled in increments of 2, 5, or 10 units.
* Using a number line: A student may incorrectly assume that every dash on the number line represents an increase of 1, without considering the actual scale or interval."
1416,Adds instead of multiplies,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add numbers together instead of multiplying them, often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication or an over-reliance on addition. This can be particularly evident when dealing with real-life scenarios or word problems where the operation is implied but not explicitly stated.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 books. If the student adds 5 + 3 = 8, instead of multiplying 5 x 3 = 15, they will incorrectly conclude that the bookshelf can hold 8 books.
- A recipe requires 2 cups of sugar for every 4 people. If a student needs to make the recipe for 12 people and adds 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 4 = 18, instead of multiplying 2 x 3 = 6 cups of sugar, they will incorrectly conclude that 18 cups of sugar are needed.
- A farmer has 4 baskets of apples, and each basket contains 6 apples. If a student adds 4 + 6 = 10, instead of multiplying 4 x 6 = 24, they will incorrectly conclude that the farmer has 10 apples."
1417,When solving an equation forgets to eliminate the coefficient in front of the variable in the last step,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving linear equations and have successfully isolated the variable term on one side of the equation, but fail to get the variable on its own by eliminating the coefficient in front of it. The coefficient is the number that multiplies the variable. 

For example, in the equation 2x = 6, some students may correctly isolate the term with the variable (2x) but forget to divide both sides of the equation by 2, which is the coefficient of x, to get the value of x. This results in an incomplete solution where the variable is not fully isolated.

This misconception can occur in various cases such as:

- Solving simple linear equations: 3x = 9, where the student might stop at this step without dividing both sides by 3 to get x on its own.
- Solving equations with negative coefficients: -4x = 12, where the student might neglect to divide by -4.
- Solving equations with fractional coefficients: 1/2x = 3, where the student may forget to multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction and isolate x."
1418,"When the dividend is a mixed number and the divisor is an integer, thinks they only perform the calculation with the integers.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a mixed number (a combination of a whole number and a fraction) by an integer. They mistakenly believe that they only need to divide the whole number part of the mixed number by the integer, completely ignoring the fractional part. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect results and a lack of understanding of how to handle mixed numbers in division operations.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When dividing 3 1/2 by 2, the student might only divide 3 by 2, getting 1.5, and forget to consider the 1/2.
- Case 2: When solving a problem like 2 3/4 divided by 3, the student may only divide 2 by 3 and neglect the 3/4.
- Case 3: In a word problem, such as ""Tom has 4 1/2 bags of apples, and he wants to put them into boxes of 2 bags each,"" the student might only divide 4 by 2 and disregard the 1/2 bag."
1419,Believes any lines that cross are perpendicular,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any two lines that intersect or cross each other are perpendicular. They may not fully understand the definition of perpendicular lines, which requires that the lines intersect at a 90-degree angle. Instead, they may focus solely on the fact that the lines cross, without considering the angle at which they meet. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify lines as perpendicular when they are not.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing shapes and assuming that any intersecting lines within the shape are perpendicular.
- When identifying angles in a diagram and assuming that any lines that cross are at a 90-degree angle.
- When solving problems involving geometry and incorrectly applying the properties of perpendicular lines to any intersecting lines.
- When working with real-world examples, such as the intersection of roads or paths, and assuming that they are always perpendicular simply because they cross."
1420,"Believes that when eliminating a variable, regardless of the signs of the terms with matching coefficients, we subtract the equations","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of eliminating variables in a system of linear equations. They might mistakenly believe that subtracting the equations is the only way to eliminate a variable, regardless of the signs of the terms with matching coefficients. This means that even if the coefficients of the variable to be eliminated have the same sign, they will still subtract the equations, which would lead to incorrect results.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: 
   2x + 3y = 7
   2x + 2y = 4

The student might subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x, even though the coefficients of x have the same sign.

- Case 2:
   x - 4y = 9
   x - 3y = 5

The student might still subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x, even though the coefficients of x are both positive.

- Case 3:
   3x + 2y = 10
   3x + y = 7

The student might again subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate x, without considering the signs and the correct operation to perform."
1421,"When factorising into double brackets, finds the sum of two values which give the non variable term in the expression rather than the product","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are attempting to factorise a quadratic expression into double brackets. They mistakenly believe that to find the numbers that go inside the brackets, they need to find two numbers that add up to the constant term (non-variable term) in the expression, rather than finding two numbers whose product equals the constant term and whose sum equals the coefficient of the middle term.

For example, when factorising the expression x^2 + 5x + 6, students with this misconception might try to find two numbers that add up to 6 (the constant term), such as 2 and 4, rather than finding the correct numbers whose product is 6 and whose sum is 5 (the coefficient of the middle term), which are 2 and 3.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* Factorising x^2 + 7x + 12, where students might try to find numbers that add up to 12 rather than finding numbers whose product is 12 and whose sum is 7.
* Factorising x^2 - 9x + 20, where students might try to find numbers that add up to 20 rather than finding numbers whose product is 20 and whose sum is -9.
* Factorising x^2 + 2x + 1, where students might try to find numbers that add up to 1 rather than finding numbers whose product is 1 and whose sum is 2."
1422,Does not recognise km as a unit of length ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not familiar with the unit ""kilometre"" (km) as a measure of length or distance. They might be used to measuring lengths in smaller units such as metres, centimetres, or millimetres, but struggle to understand that kilometres are a larger unit of length, often used to express longer distances, such as between cities or towns.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When reading maps or road signs that display distances in kilometres, and the student is unable to understand the scale.
* When comparing distances, such as the length of a school run, which might be a few kilometres, with the length of a room, which is typically measured in metres.
* When solving problems that involve converting between units of length, such as converting kilometres to metres, and the student is unsure how to make the conversion.
* When discussing real-life scenarios, such as the distance to a nearby city or the length of a marathon, which are often expressed in kilometres."
1423,Struggles to estimate 3D volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty visualizing and estimating the volume of three-dimensional objects. They may struggle to understand the concept of volume as the amount of space inside a 3D object, and how it is measured in cubic units. This can lead to difficulties in estimating the volume of everyday objects, such as containers, rooms, or buildings.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to estimate the volume of a rectangular prism, a student may confuse it with the area of the base or the height, rather than considering the product of the three dimensions (length x width x height).
* When comparing the volumes of two different containers, a student may incorrectly assume that the container with the larger surface area has the larger volume.
* When trying to calculate the volume of a complex 3D shape, such as a cylinder or a cone, a student may become confused about how to apply the formula or how to break down the shape into simpler components.
* When given a real-world problem, such as estimating the volume of a room or a tank, a student may struggle to apply mathematical concepts to the practical situation.
* When working with different units of measurement, such as cubic centimeters, cubic meters, or liters, a student may become confused about how to convert between units or how to apply the correct unit to the problem."
1424,Thinks numbers greater than 1 cannot be converted into fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of what constitutes a fraction. They may believe that fractions are only used to represent parts of a whole that are less than 1, and therefore, numbers greater than 1 cannot be expressed as fractions. They may not realize that fractions can also represent whole numbers or mixed numbers, which can be greater than 1.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, students may struggle to understand that the whole number part can be greater than 1.
* When adding or subtracting fractions, students may not be able to handle cases where the result is a fraction greater than 1.
* When simplifying fractions, students may not recognize that a fraction can be simplified to a whole number greater than 1.
* When solving real-world problems, students may encounter situations where they need to express a quantity greater than 1 as a fraction, such as 3/1 or 5/1, but may not know how to do so.
* When dealing with equivalent ratios, students may not understand that ratios can be scaled up to represent quantities greater than 1."
1425,Believes two lines of the same length are parallel,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that two lines of equal length are automatically parallel. They may think that the defining characteristic of parallel lines is that they have the same length, rather than understanding that parallel lines are lines that lie in the same plane and never intersect, regardless of their length.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify parallel lines in a diagram and they choose lines that have the same length, but are not actually parallel.
- When students are given a set of lines with different lengths and are asked to determine which ones are parallel, and they incorrectly choose the lines with the same length.
- When students are asked to draw a pair of parallel lines and they draw two lines of the same length, thinking that this is the defining characteristic of parallel lines.
- When students are solving problems involving angles and lines, and they incorrectly assume that two lines of the same length will always have the same angle relationships."
1426,Thinks rule for calculating interior angles only applies to regular polygons,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the formula for calculating the sum of interior angles in a polygon (i.e., (n-2) * 180 degrees, where n is the number of sides) is exclusive to regular polygons. They may think that this rule doesn't apply to irregular polygons or that a different formula is needed for non-regular shapes.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to calculate the sum of interior angles of an irregular polygon, and they respond that the formula doesn't apply or is unsure of how to proceed.
- When comparing the interior angles of regular and irregular polygons with the same number of sides, and students expect the sums to be different due to the shapes' irregularity.
- When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles in real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, where irregular polygons are common, and students struggle to apply the formula correctly."
1427,Believes cube numbers are just multiples of 3,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that cube numbers are simply multiples of 3, rather than numbers obtained by multiplying a number by itself three times (e.g., 2 × 2 × 2 = 8). This error is likely due to the fact that the first few cube numbers (1³ = 1, 2³ = 8 is not, but 3³ = 27 is indeed a multiple of 3 and 3 is the base) may lead students to recognize a false pattern and assume that all cube numbers are multiples of 3.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify cube numbers in a sequence, they may incorrectly select numbers that are multiples of 3 but not actual cube numbers (e.g., 6, 9, 12).
- When students are given a cube root problem, they may provide an incorrect answer that is simply a multiple of 3, rather than the actual cube root (e.g., ∛64 = 4, but students might answer 6 or 9 because they are multiples of 3).
- When students are asked to generate a list of cube numbers, they may produce a list that includes multiples of 3 but not actual cube numbers (e.g., 3, 6, 9, 12, instead of 1, 8, 27, 64)."
1428,"Does not understand the meaning of ""value""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term ""value"" in a mathematical context as simply the numerical part of an expression or equation, without considering the unit, variable, or context associated with it. They may view the value as just a number, disregarding any algebraic or physical meaning it may carry.

For example, when dealing with:

- Algebra: Students might think the value of a variable (e.g., x) is just a number, without understanding that it can represent a specific quantity or measurement.
- Data and Statistics: When analyzing data, students may misinterpret the value of a data point as just a number, rather than considering its relevance to the context or its relationship with other data points.
- Number: Students may confuse the value of a digit in a number with its place value, leading to misunderstandings when performing arithmetic operations.
- Geometry and Measure: Students may not fully grasp the concept of value when dealing with measurements, such as the value of an angle or the value of a shape's perimeter, and may view these values as just numbers rather than quantities with specific meanings.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in applying mathematical concepts to real-world problems and may hinder students' ability to make connections between different mathematical ideas."
1429,Believes equivalent fractions are formed with addition not multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to form equivalent fractions, they need to add the same number to both the numerator and the denominator, rather than multiplying both by the same number. For example, they may think that to find an equivalent fraction for 1/2, they can add 2 to both the numerator and denominator, resulting in 3/4, which is not an equivalent fraction.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying fractions: A student may try to simplify the fraction 2/4 by adding 1 to both numbers, resulting in 3/5, instead of dividing both numbers by 2 to get 1/2.
- When comparing fractions: A student may incorrectly compare fractions by adding the same number to both the numerator and denominator, leading to incorrect conclusions about which fraction is larger or smaller.
- When performing operations with fractions: A student may attempt to add or subtract fractions with different denominators by adding the same number to both the numerator and denominator, rather than finding a common denominator through multiplication."
1430,Does not recognise that the intersection of a Venn diagram represents those belonging to both sets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the overlapping region of two or more circles in a Venn diagram as a separate entity, rather than understanding that it represents the elements that are common to both sets. They may view the intersection as a distinct category, rather than recognizing that it is a subset of both sets.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify the number of elements that belong to both set A and set B, they may count the intersection as a separate group, rather than including those elements in both sets.
* When using Venn diagrams to solve problems involving union and intersection of sets, students may incorrectly interpret the intersection as a distinct set, leading to incorrect calculations.
* In real-world applications, such as categorizing objects or people into different groups, students may fail to recognize that some individuals or objects can belong to multiple categories simultaneously, which is represented by the intersection in a Venn diagram."
1431,"Believes you add the whole to the numerators, ignoring denominators, when adding a mixed number to a proper fraction with the same denominator.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding a mixed number to a proper fraction with the same denominator, but they incorrectly add the whole number part of the mixed number to the numerator of the proper fraction, ignoring the denominators. They fail to recognize that the whole number part of the mixed number needs to be converted to an improper fraction with the same denominator before adding it to the proper fraction.

For example, when adding 2 1/4 + 1/4, students with this misconception might simply add 2 (the whole number part) to 1 (the numerator of the proper fraction), resulting in an incorrect answer of 3/4.

Cases when this misconception will occur:

- 3 1/2 + 1/2
- 1 3/4 + 2/4
- 2 2/3 + 1/3
- 4 1/5 + 3/5"
1432,"When factorising into double brackets, believes the sum of the two values in the brackets equals bx rather than b","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to factorise quadratic expressions into double brackets, typically in the form of (x + a)(x + b). The student mistakenly believes that when factorising an expression like x^2 + bx + c, the sum of the two values in the brackets (a and b) should equal the coefficient of the x term (bx) rather than just b. This misunderstanding shows a lack of grasp of the underlying algebraic structure of the factorisation process.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising the expression x^2 + 7x + 12, the student might think that the two numbers in the brackets should add up to 7x, rather than just 7.
- When given the expression x^2 + 9x + 20, the student may incorrectly assume that the sum of the numbers in the brackets should be 9x, instead of just 9.
- Factorising x^2 + 5x + 6, the student might mistakenly believe that the two values in the brackets should add up to 5x, rather than just 5."
1433,"When factorising into single brackets, only factors out the numerical values and forgets to factorise possible variables","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to factorise expressions into single brackets. They tend to focus solely on factoring out numerical values, such as greatest common factors (GCFs), but neglect to consider the possibility of factoring out variables (letters) that are common to all terms in the expression.

For example, when given the expression 3x + 6x, students with this misconception may only factor out the numerical value 3, resulting in 3(x + 2x), instead of factoring out both the numerical value and the variable x, which would result in a different, more simplified expression.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Factorising the expression 4x + 8x
- Simplifying the expression 2x^2 + 4x
- Factorising the expression x^2 + 3x"
1434,Believes any adjacent angles sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the property of supplementary angles formed by two intersecting lines. They may mistakenly believe that any two angles that are adjacent (share a common side and vertex) will always sum to 180 degrees, regardless of the geometric configuration. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the specific conditions under which adjacent angles form a linear pair and sum to 180 degrees.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dealing with angles in a triangle, students may incorrectly assume that any two adjacent angles will sum to 180 degrees, rather than recognizing that the sum of all three angles is 180 degrees.
- When working with quadrilaterals or polygons, students may mistakenly apply the 180-degree rule to adjacent angles that do not form a linear pair.
- In problems involving angles formed by intersecting lines, students may incorrectly assume that any two adjacent angles will sum to 180 degrees, without checking if the angles actually form a linear pair."
1435,When subtracting from a negative thinks the answer must be positive,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully comfortable with the concept of negative numbers and how subtraction works with them. They may think that subtracting a number from a negative number will always result in a positive answer, regardless of the relative values of the numbers. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the number line and how subtraction is equivalent to moving in the opposite direction.

For example, when faced with a problem like:

-3 - 2 = ?

A student with this misconception might think that subtracting 2 from -3 will result in a positive number, simply because they are subtracting from a negative.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* -5 - 1 = ? (student thinks answer is positive)
* -2 - 3 = ? (student thinks answer is positive)
* -10 - 5 = ? (student thinks answer is positive)

This misconception can lead to errors in more complex calculations, such as solving equations or inequalities involving negative numbers."
1436,Confuses cubic and exponential graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the characteristics of cubic and exponential graphs. They may incorrectly identify or interpret the key features of these graphs, such as the rate of growth, shape, and asymptotes. Students may mistakenly attribute the rapid growth of an exponential graph to a cubic graph or vice versa. They might also fail to recognize the distinctive 'S' shape or the horizontal asymptote in a cubic or exponential graph, leading to incorrect conclusions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing population growth, where students might incorrectly assume a cubic relationship when the growth is actually exponential.
- When modeling real-world phenomena, such as chemical reactions or financial transactions, where students might mistakenly use a cubic function to describe an exponential relationship.
- When graphing functions, where students may incorrectly label or identify a cubic graph as exponential, or vice versa, due to a lack of understanding of the distinct characteristics of each type of graph.
- When solving problems involving optimization or prediction, where students may choose the wrong type of function (cubic or exponential) to model the situation, leading to incorrect results."
1437,Assumes the fractional index denotes the root and power the other way around,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that in an expression with a fractional index, such as x^(3/2), the numerator denotes the root and the denominator denotes the power, rather than the other way around. They may think that x^(3/2) means taking the square root of x and then raising the result to the power of 3, rather than raising x to the power of 3 and then taking the square root of the result.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and roots.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions with fractional indices, such as x^(3/2) or x^(2/3).
- When solving equations involving fractional indices, such as x^(3/2) = 4.
- When working with expressions involving multiple operations, such as 2x^(3/2) + 3x^(1/2).
- When graphing functions with fractional indices, such as y = x^(3/2).
- When applying the rules of indices to expressions with fractional indices, such as x^(1/2) × x^(1/2)."
1438,Believes division of surds always results in an integer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rule that the division of like surds (radicals with the same index and radicand) results in an integer, and incorrectly assume that this applies to all divisions of surds. They may incorrectly believe that the result of dividing any two surds will always be an integer, regardless of the index or radicand.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dividing surds with different indices, such as √8 ÷ √2, students may incorrectly assume the result is an integer.
- When dividing surds with different radicands, such as √3 ÷ √5, students may expect the result to be an integer.
- When dividing surds with the same radicand but different coefficients, such as 2√3 ÷ 3√3, students may mistakenly think the result is an integer."
1439,"When solving simultaneous equations, assumes every variable has equal value.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations, but they fail to understand that each variable in the equations can have a unique value. They mistakenly believe that all variables must have the same value, often leading to incorrect solutions. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of variables and their relationships in equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When given two simple linear equations, such as x + y = 4 and x - y = 2, students may assume that x and y must be equal and try to solve for a single value.
- In a system of equations like 2x + 3y = 7 and x - 2y = -3, students may think that x and y must have the same value and attempt to find a common solution.
- When dealing with word problems that involve simultaneous equations, such as finding the cost of two different items given their total cost and the difference in their prices, students may incorrectly assume that the prices of both items are equal."
1440,Believes 180 degrees is an obtuse angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of obtuse angles. They may recall that obtuse angles are greater than 90 degrees, but mistakenly believe that any angle greater than 90 degrees, including 180 degrees, is considered obtuse. However, this misconception fails to account for the fact that 180 degrees is actually a straight line, which is a special type of angle that separates obtuse and acute angles.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to identify the type of angle formed by two intersecting lines that create a straight line (180 degrees), students may incorrectly label it as obtuse.
- When solving geometry problems that involve calculating the sum of interior angles in a triangle, students may incorrectly assume that a 180-degree angle is obtuse, leading to errors in their calculations.
- When classifying angles in real-world objects, such as the angle between two walls that meet at a corner (180 degrees), students may mistakenly describe it as an obtuse angle."
1441,"Thinks decimal place value works the same as integer place value, ones will follow tenths","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply their understanding of place value for whole numbers to decimal numbers. They may believe that just as the place value increases in whole numbers (ones, tens, hundreds), the same pattern applies to decimal numbers, assuming that tenths are followed by ones. In reality, the place value system for decimal numbers is an extension of the whole number system, but it works in a different way. Students may have difficulty grasping that tenths are actually smaller than ones and that the place value decreases as you move further to the right of the decimal point.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When writing decimal numbers: A student might write 1.35 as 1.305, mistakenly placing the 3 in the ""ones"" place.
2. When rounding decimals: A student might round 2.46 to 2.4, thinking that the 6 is in the ""ones"" place, rather than the hundredths place.
3. When comparing decimals: A student might believe that 3.25 is greater than 3.5 because they think the 2 is in the ""tens"" place, rather than the tenths place.
4. When performing decimal arithmetic: A student might incorrectly align decimal numbers when adding or subtracting, assuming that the tenths place is equivalent to the ones place."
1442,Think cross section of a prism is the biggest face,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the cross-section of a prism is always the largest face of the prism. They may think that the cross-section is the base or the side with the greatest area, rather than understanding that a cross-section is a two-dimensional representation of the prism at a particular point or plane. 

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to identify or draw the cross-section of a prism, they may draw the largest face instead of the actual cross-section.
- When calculating the area or volume of a prism, students may use the dimensions of the largest face instead of the cross-sectional dimensions.
- In real-world applications, such as engineering or architecture, students may misinterpret the cross-sectional view of a building or a structure, leading to incorrect calculations or designs.
- When working with 3D models or diagrams, students may have difficulty visualizing the cross-section of a prism, leading them to rely on the largest face as a substitute.
- In problems involving the volume of water in a tank or the area of a slice of a prism, students may incorrectly use the largest face to calculate the volume or area, rather than the actual cross-section."
1443,"Thinks that when raising a variable with a coefficient to a power, only the coefficient is affected by the power","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that when raising a variable with a coefficient to a power, the power only applies to the coefficient and not the variable. For example, they might think that (2x)^3 means 2^3 * x, rather than (2*x)^3. This misconception can lead to incorrect simplification of algebraic expressions.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Simplifying expressions like (3x)^2, where students might think the answer is 9x instead of 9x^2.
- Expanding expressions like (2y)^4, where students might think the answer is 16y instead of 16y^4.
- Solving equations like (4z)^2 = 64, where students might think the solution is z = 2 instead of z = 2 or z = -2."
1444,Does not understand that the negative outside the bracket means answer will be negative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with expressions that involve a negative sign outside a set of brackets or parentheses. They may incorrectly assume that the negative sign only affects the first term inside the brackets or has no effect at all, rather than understanding that it changes the sign of the entire expression within the brackets.

For example, when faced with expressions like:

- Case 1: -(3 + 4), students may think the answer is 3 - 4 instead of -7.
- Case 2: -(-5 - 2), students may think the answer is -5 + 2 instead of 7.
- Case 3: -(2 - 8), students may think the answer is 2 + 8 instead of 6.

This misconception can lead to errors in simplifying expressions, solving equations, and manipulating algebraic expressions. It highlights the need for a clear understanding of how negative signs affect expressions within brackets."
1445,Believes you find the angle for a pie chart sector by doing its frequency multiplied by total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to find the angle of a sector in a pie chart, they need to multiply the frequency of the sector by the total frequency. They may think that this operation will give them the correct angle, not realizing that the actual process involves finding the proportion of the sector's frequency to the total frequency and then converting it to an angle. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When creating a pie chart to represent favorite colors in a class and a student thinks that if 5 students like the color blue and there are 20 students in total, the angle for the blue sector would be 5 x 20.
- When analyzing data on the number of hours spent on different activities in a day and a student believes that if they spent 2 hours watching TV and a total of 24 hours in a day, the angle for the TV sector would be 2 x 24.
- When making a pie chart to display the distribution of different types of music liked by a group of people and a student thinks that if 8 people like rock music and there are 32 people in total, the angle for the rock music sector would be 8 x 32."
1446,"When calculating perimeter, only adds two sides","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of perimeter, which is the total distance around a shape. They may mistakenly believe that the perimeter is only the sum of two sides, often the length and width, of a shape, rather than the total distance around it. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the definition of perimeter or a misunderstanding of how to apply it to different shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the perimeter of a rectangle, students may only add the length and width, forgetting to add the other two sides.
- When calculating the perimeter of a triangle, students may only add two sides, forgetting to add the third side.
- When calculating the perimeter of a shape with more than four sides, such as a hexagon or octagon, students may only add two sides, not realizing that they need to add all the sides to find the total perimeter.
- When solving word problems that involve finding the perimeter of a shape, such as finding the distance around a garden or a room, students may only consider two sides, leading to an incorrect answer."
1447,Writes the remainder as the digit after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers and obtaining a remainder. They mistakenly believe that the remainder can be written as the digit immediately after the decimal point in the quotient. This misunderstanding stems from a lack of clarity about the relationship between remainders and decimal expansions. 

For instance, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dividing 17 by 5, a student might write the result as 3.2, thinking that the remainder 2 can be directly placed after the decimal point.
- When dividing 23 by 4, a student might write the result as 5.3, assuming the remainder 3 is the digit after the decimal point.
- When dividing 19 by 3, a student might write the result as 6.1, mistakenly placing the remainder 1 after the decimal point."
1448,Believes the solutions of a quadratic equation are the negative of the absolute values of the constants in the factorised form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the constants in the factorised form of a quadratic equation and its solutions. They may think that the solutions are simply the negative of the absolute values of the constants, without considering the actual relationships between the constants and the solutions. 

For example, given a quadratic equation in the form of (x - a)(x - b) = 0, students with this misconception may believe that the solutions are -|a| and -|b|, rather than a and b. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving quadratic equations in the form of (x - a)(x - b) = 0, where a and b are positive constants.
- When finding the roots of a quadratic equation in the form of x^2 + bx + c = 0, where b and c are constants.
- When graphing quadratic functions and identifying the x-intercepts, which are the solutions to the corresponding quadratic equation.
- When solving problems that involve quadratic equations, such as projectile motion or optimization problems."
1449,Believes rounding numbers down would give an overestimate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that rounding numbers down will result in an overestimate, rather than an underestimate. They may think that by rounding down, they are somehow increasing the value or quantity being measured, rather than decreasing it. For example, if a student is asked to estimate the total cost of items that cost $4.75 each, they might round the price down to $4 and believe that this would give an overestimate of the total cost, when in fact it would give an underestimate.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Rounding down the cost of items to calculate the total cost.
- Rounding down measurements to calculate the area or volume of an object.
- Rounding down numbers in a data set to calculate the mean or median.
- Rounding down the value of a quantity to calculate the total amount or value."
1450,Does not understand how to apply sohcahtoa,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to apply the trigonometric ratios (Sine, Cosine, and Tangent) in the context of right-angled triangles. They may have memorized the SOHCAHTOA acronym, but fail to understand the relationships between the ratios and how to use them to solve problems.

SOHCAHTOA is often used as a mnemonic device to remember the relationships:

- Sine = Opposite over Hypotenuse (SOH)
- Cosine = Adjacent over Hypotenuse (CAH)
- Tangent = Opposite over Adjacent (TOA)

However, students with this misconception may not know which ratio to use in a given situation, or how to plug in the values to solve the problem.

This misconception will often occur in cases such as:

- Finding the length of a side in a right-angled triangle when given one angle and the length of another side.
- Determining the angle of elevation or depression in a right-angled triangle when given the lengths of two sides.
- Solving problems involving right-angled triangles in real-world contexts, such as calculating the height of a building or the distance to a ship at sea.

For example:

- Case 1: In a right-angled triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is 10cm and one angle is 30 degrees. What is the length of the opposite side?
- Case 2: A surveyor measures the angle of elevation to the top of a building to be 60 degrees. If the distance from the surveyor to the base of the building is 50m, what is the height of the building?
- Case 3: A ship is 200m away from a lighthouse. If the angle of depression from the top of the lighthouse to the ship is 20 degrees, how high is the lighthouse?"
1451,Assumes that the square root is the only type of root,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of roots, but the instruction focuses primarily on square roots. As a result, students may believe that the only type of root is the square root, and they may not be aware of the existence of other types of roots, such as cube roots, fourth roots, or nth roots in general. They may also assume that the symbol √ only refers to square roots and may not understand that it can be used to represent other types of roots as well.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When simplifying expressions involving roots, students may incorrectly assume that the expression √x always refers to the square root of x, and may not consider the possibility that it could refer to a different type of root.
* When solving equations involving roots, students may only consider the square root as a possible solution, and may not think to consider other types of roots.
* When working with radical expressions, students may incorrectly simplify expressions by only considering the square root, and may not take into account the possibility of other types of roots.
* When graphing functions involving roots, students may incorrectly assume that the graph will always be a square root function, and may not consider the possibility that it could be a different type of root function."
1452,"When converting ratio to fractions, puts the other side of the ratio as the denominator rather than the total","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a ratio into a fraction. For instance, if a ratio is given as '3 boys to 5 girls', some students mistakenly write the fraction of boys as 3/5, assuming the other side of the ratio (5 girls) is the denominator. However, the correct denominator should represent the total parts in the ratio, which in this case would be 3 + 5 = 8.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When expressing a part-to-part ratio as a fraction (e.g., '5 pencils to 7 pens' might be incorrectly written as 5/7 instead of 5/(5+7)).
- In word problems that involve sharing or proportions, such as 'a recipe requires a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar' (students might write the fraction of flour as 2/3 instead of 2/(2+3)).
- When interpreting data in the form of ratios, such as 'a team's win-to-loss ratio is 4:6', and students need to find the fraction of wins (they might incorrectly write it as 4/6 instead of 4/(4+6))."
1453,"Subtracts from left to right, ignoring the word ‘from’","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with subtraction problems presented in a written or word problem format, particularly those that include the word 'from'. Instead of understanding that 'from' indicates the starting value from which they need to subtract, they simply perform the subtraction operation from left to right. This means they subtract the first number they see from the second number, regardless of the word order or the presence of the word 'from'.

For example, in the problem ""Subtract 5 from 12"", a student with this misconception might subtract 12 from 5 because they are working from left to right, ignoring the word 'from' that indicates the correct order of the subtraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtract 7 from 15
- Take 3 from 9
- What is the result of subtracting 4 from 11?
- 8 subtracted from 20 is?"
1454,Believes they can eliminate a variable without making the coefficients the same in simultaneous equations,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving simultaneous equations and want to eliminate one of the variables. They mistakenly believe that they can simply add or subtract the equations without making the coefficients of the variable to be eliminated the same. They may think that as long as the variable is present in both equations, they can eliminate it by adding or subtracting, regardless of the coefficients.

For example, consider the following simultaneous equations:

2x + 3y = 7
x + 2y = 5

A student with this misconception may attempt to eliminate the variable 'y' by simply adding the two equations, without realizing that the coefficients of 'y' are not the same.

Another case where this misconception may occur is when the equations have different signs for the variable to be eliminated. For instance:

3x - 2y = 4
2x + 4y = 10

In this case, the student may try to eliminate 'y' by adding the equations, without taking into account the different signs and coefficients of 'y'.

This misconception can also occur when there are more than two equations, and students try to eliminate variables by combining equations without considering the coefficients. For example:

x + 2y - z = 3
2x - 3y + z = 1
x + y + z = 2

A student with this misconception may try to eliminate 'z' by adding the first and second equations, without realizing that the coefficients of 'z' are not the same."
1455,Calculates circumference when asked for area,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a circle but instead calculate the circumference. It suggests that they may be confusing the two concepts or incorrectly applying the formulas. The circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle, typically calculated using the formula C = 2πr or C = πd, whereas the area is the amount of space inside the circle, calculated using the formula A = πr^2. Students may mistakenly use the circumference formula when asked for the area, resulting in an incorrect answer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given the radius or diameter of a circle and asked to find the area, but they mistakenly apply the circumference formula.
- In problems involving real-world applications, such as finding the area of a circular garden bed or the area of a pizza, where students may incorrectly use the circumference formula.
- In multi-step problems that require students to find both the circumference and area of a circle, where they may get the two formulas mixed up.
- When students are working with word problems that involve both linear and area measurements, leading to confusion between the two concepts."
1456,Believes linear graphs can be curved,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a poor understanding of the definition and characteristics of linear graphs. They may think that as long as a graph shows a general trend or pattern, it can be classified as linear, regardless of its shape. This misunderstanding can be due to a lack of exposure to various types of graphs or inadequate emphasis on the distinct features of linear graphs, such as a constant rate of change and a straight line.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing data from real-life situations, students might incorrectly assume that a curved or irregular shape is linear because it shows a general trend.
- When analyzing graphs with small or subtle curves, students may mistakenly identify them as linear due to the slight deviation from a straight line.
- When working with graphs that have a large scale or a limited range, students might misinterpret a curved section as linear due to the graph's compressed or zoomed-in appearance.
- When comparing linear and non-linear relationships, students may struggle to distinguish between the two and incorrectly label a curved graph as linear."
1457,Does not understand the interpretation of the fx column in a frequency table,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the purpose and meaning of the 'fx' column in a frequency table, which is used to calculate the total or cumulative frequency of each data value by multiplying the frequency (f) by the data value (x). Students with this misconception may not understand how to use the 'fx' column to find the total or mean of a dataset, or they may misinterpret the values in this column as the actual data values rather than the product of frequency and data value.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When asked to calculate the mean of a dataset using a frequency table, a student may incorrectly use the values in the 'x' column instead of the 'fx' column.
- When interpreting a frequency table, a student may mistakenly think that the 'fx' column represents the actual data values, rather than the product of frequency and data value.
- When creating their own frequency table, a student may forget to include the 'fx' column or incorrectly calculate the values in this column.
- When solving problems involving grouped data, a student may not know how to use the 'fx' column to find the total or mean of the dataset."
1458,Believes 0 multiplied by a number gives the number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplication, particularly with the number 0. They may think that multiplying a number by 0 leaves the number unchanged, rather than resulting in 0. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the multiplication principle, which states that multiplication represents repeated addition. When you multiply a number by 0, you are essentially adding the number zero times, resulting in 0.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying 0 by a small number, e.g., 0 × 2 = ? (student answers 2)
- When multiplying 0 by a large number, e.g., 0 × 100 = ? (student answers 100)
- When solving word problems, e.g., ""If I have 0 groups of 5 pencils, how many pencils do I have?"" (student answers 5)
- When simplifying algebraic expressions, e.g., 0 × x = ? (student answers x)"
1459,Does not recognise that a surd will simplify to a whole number and not longer be a surd if the number under the surd is a square number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental property of surds. A surd is a square root of a number that cannot be expressed as a whole number. However, when the number under the surd (radicand) is a perfect square, the surd can be simplified to a whole number, and it is no longer a surd. 

Students with this misconception may assume that any expression with a square root will always result in a surd, regardless of the radicand's properties. They might not recognize that the square root of a perfect square is a whole number, not a surd.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
1. Simplifying √16, the student might think the answer is still a surd, not recognizing that √16 = 4, a whole number.
2. When solving an equation like √x = 5, and the solution is x = 25, the student might write √25 as the answer, not realizing that √25 simplifies to 5, a whole number.
3. When evaluating expressions like √4 or √9, students might treat them as surds, not understanding that they can be simplified to whole numbers, 2 and 3, respectively."
1460,Identifies second decimal place value when asked for the second significant figure,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of significant figures and decimal place value. They tend to confuse the position of the digit in a number (i.e., the second decimal place) with the concept of significant figures, which is a way of expressing the precision of a number. In the case of significant figures, the second significant figure is the second non-zero digit in a number, which may not necessarily be in the second decimal place. Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify the second decimal place as the second significant figure, rather than looking for the second non-zero digit.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When rounding a number to two significant figures, a student may look at the second decimal place instead of the second non-zero digit.
- When comparing the precision of two measurements, a student may incorrectly assume that a number with two decimal places has two significant figures, regardless of whether the digits are non-zero or not.
- When converting between units, a student may misinterpret the position of the digits in the converted number, leading to incorrect identification of the second significant figure."
1461,Believes parallel lines have gradients that multiply to give -1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the gradients of parallel and perpendicular lines. They mistakenly believe that parallel lines have gradients that are negative reciprocals of each other, i.e., multiplying to -1, which is actually a characteristic of perpendicular lines. This misconception can lead to errors in identifying and working with parallel lines in geometry and coordinate geometry.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying whether two lines are parallel based on their gradients.
- When finding the equation of a line parallel to a given line.
- When graphing parallel lines on a coordinate plane.
- When solving problems involving parallel lines in trigonometry and geometry.
- When determining the relationship between the gradients of two lines in a geometric shape, such as a parallelogram or trapezium."
1462,Believes height represents frequency on a histogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the height of a bar in a histogram directly represents the frequency of the data. They may assume that the taller the bar, the higher the frequency, without considering the width of the bar or the scale of the y-axis. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly interpret the data and make incorrect conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing two bars of different widths, students may think the taller bar represents more data, even if the wider bar actually represents a greater range of values and therefore more data.
- When the scale of the y-axis is not uniform, students may misinterpret the height of the bars, thinking that a small increase in height represents a small increase in frequency, when in fact it may represent a large increase.
- When dealing with histograms with varying class intervals, students may assume that the height of each bar is directly comparable, without taking into account the different widths of the intervals.
- When students are asked to create their own histograms, they may incorrectly label the y-axis as ""frequency"" without considering the effect of the bar width on the representation of the data."
1463,"When adding fractions, adds the numerators and multiplies the denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of adding fractions with different denominators. They mistakenly believe that to add fractions, they can simply add the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom). This error shows a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the need to find a common denominator when adding fractions.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When adding fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6
* When dealing with real-life problems that involve adding fractions, e.g., combining ingredients for a recipe
* When solving word problems that involve adding fractions, e.g., ""Tom has 1/4 of a pizza and his friend has 1/6 of a pizza. How much pizza do they have in total?""
* When working with mixed numbers and improper fractions, e.g., 2 1/4 + 1 1/6."
1464,"When solving simultaneous equations graphically, they think the solutions are the y-intercepts","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations graphically. They may mistakenly believe that the solutions to the system of equations are the points where the individual lines intersect the y-axis (y-intercepts), rather than the point(s) where the two lines intersect each other. This misconception may stem from an incomplete understanding of the concept of solving simultaneous equations graphically, where students focus on finding the individual y-intercepts rather than analyzing the intersection points of the lines.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are given two linear equations and asked to find the solution graphically, they may only look for the y-intercepts and write those as the solutions.
* When the y-intercepts of the two lines coincide, students may think that there is only one solution, without realizing that the actual solution lies at the intersection point of the two lines, which could be elsewhere on the graph.
* When the lines are parallel, students may incorrectly conclude that there are two solutions, corresponding to the two y-intercepts, rather than recognizing that there is no solution since the lines never intersect.
* When dealing with non-linear equations, such as quadratic or circular equations, students may incorrectly apply the same logic and look for y-intercepts as solutions, rather than analyzing the intersections between the curves."
1465,Uses outcome as numerator in probability ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use the outcome or the number of favorable outcomes as the numerator in a probability fraction, instead of using the number of successful outcomes or favorable outcomes that have occurred out of the total number of trials or outcomes. 

In probability, the numerator should represent the number of successful outcomes, not the outcome itself. However, students with this misconception might put the outcome or the number representing the favorable outcome (e.g., the number on a die, the number of a specific card) as the numerator, which can lead to incorrect probability calculations.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Calculating the probability of rolling a specific number on a die, where the student uses the number on the die as the numerator instead of the number of times that number is rolled.
- Determining the probability of drawing a specific card from a deck, where the student uses the number on the card as the numerator instead of the number of times that card is drawn.
- Finding the probability of getting a certain color of marble from a bag, where the student uses the number representing the color as the numerator instead of the number of marbles of that color."
1466,Thinks there are 100kg in a ton,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 kilograms in a ton. However, this is not the case. The confusion might stem from not understanding the differences between the metric ton and other units of measurement. A ton is often used to express large quantities of weight or mass, but if students are not familiar with the conversion between tons and kilograms, they may incorrectly assume that 1 ton is equal to 100 kilograms.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading or hearing about objects that weigh a ton in everyday conversations or media, and assuming it means 100 kilograms.
- When solving problems involving conversions between tons and kilograms, and using the incorrect conversion factor.
- When comparing the weight of objects in tons and kilograms, and not recognizing the actual difference between the two units.
- When working with real-world applications, such as calculating the weight of goods or materials in tons, and using the incorrect conversion to kilograms."
1467,Believes the power button writes a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the power or exponent button (usually denoted by a small superscript or a caret ^ symbol) on a calculator or in mathematical notation is used to represent a fraction. They may think that, for example, 1/2 can be written as 1^2, not understanding the actual purpose of the exponentiation operation. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students first learn about fractions and exponents in Year 6 or 7 and get confused between the notations.
- When students are using calculators and accidentally press the power button instead of the division button.
- When students are simplifying algebraic expressions with exponents and fractions, and incorrectly apply the rules of exponents to fractions."
1468,Orders integers based on first digits without taking into account place value,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students compare and order integers based solely on the first digit, disregarding the place value of the digits. For example, when comparing numbers like 120 and 19, students with this misconception might say that 19 is greater than 120 because 9 is greater than 2 (the first digit of 120 is 1, but they're focusing on the 2). They fail to consider the place value of each digit, which would tell them that 120 is actually a larger number due to the hundreds place being occupied by the digit 1.

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- Comparing multi-digit numbers with different numbers of digits (e.g., 100 vs. 9)
- Ordering a list of numbers with varying place values (e.g., 12, 120, 1,200)
- Identifying the largest or smallest number in a set of multi-digit integers (e.g., 45, 450, 4,500)"
1469,Does not recognise when simplifying a fraction may be helpful,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with fractions and do not understand the importance of simplifying them to their simplest form. They may think that the original fraction is the same as the simplified one, or they may not see the value in simplifying fractions. This can lead to difficulties when comparing fractions, adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, or even when working with equivalent ratios.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- When comparing fractions to determine which one is larger or smaller, a student may think that 2/4 is different from 1/2, not realizing that they are equivalent.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, a student may struggle to find a common denominator if they do not simplify fractions first, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6.
- When working with equivalent ratios, a student may not recognize that 2/4 is the same as 1/2, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When solving real-world problems, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza among friends, a student may not see the practical value in simplifying fractions to make calculations easier."
1470,"Does not know the meaning of the word ""product""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the mathematical term ""product"" and its relationship to multiplication. They may interpret the word ""product"" as referring to an item or object that is manufactured or sold, rather than the result of multiplying two or more numbers together. This misunderstanding can lead to confusion when students are asked to find the product of two numbers or when they encounter the term in mathematical expressions or word problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When a teacher asks students to ""find the product of 4 and 5"", and students think they are being asked about a physical object rather than a mathematical calculation.
* When students read a word problem that says ""the product of two numbers is 24"", and they think it's referring to a product they can buy in a store rather than the result of a multiplication operation.
* When students are working on a math problem that involves multiplying multiple numbers together and the question asks for the ""product"", but they're not sure what operation to perform."
1471,Mixes up colder and hotter when comparing temperatures,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of temperature comparisons, often leading to incorrect conclusions about what is hotter or colder. Students may mistakenly believe that a larger number in a negative temperature is hotter than a smaller number in a negative temperature (e.g., -10°C is hotter than -20°C is correct but they may think -20°C is hotter than -10°C), or they may get confused when comparing temperatures that are below and above zero (e.g., -5°C and 5°C).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing two negative temperatures, e.g., -5°C and -10°C
- Comparing temperatures below and above zero, e.g., -2°C and 3°C
- Comparing temperatures in different units, e.g., -10°C and 14°F
- Reading temperatures on a thermometer and misinterpreting the results
- Solving word problems that involve temperature comparisons, e.g., ""It was -8°C yesterday and -12°C today. Which day was colder?"""
1472,"Believes that they can reverse a percentage decrease by dividing by the decimal multiplier of the percentage itself, not the multiplier for the percentage decrease.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the original value after a percentage decrease has been applied. They mistakenly believe that to 'reverse' the percentage decrease, they can simply divide the new value by the decimal multiplier of the percentage itself, rather than the multiplier for the percentage decrease. For example, if a price is decreased by 20%, students may think they can find the original price by dividing the new price by 0.20 (the decimal multiplier of 20%) instead of dividing by 0.80 (the multiplier for the 20% decrease, which is 1 - 0.20).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price. If the sale price is $85, what was the original price?
- A store has a 25% discount on all electronics. If a discounted TV costs $450, what was its original price?
- A car's value decreases by 10% over a year. If its current value is $36,000, what was its original value?"
1473,Believes adding two numbers finds their lowest common multiple,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the lowest common multiple (LCM). They may believe that simply adding two numbers together will result in their LCM. This is likely due to a lack of understanding of the actual process for finding the LCM, which involves identifying the multiples of each number and finding the smallest multiple they have in common.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the LCM of two small numbers, such as 2 and 3, where the sum (5) is close to the actual LCM (6), leading students to believe that addition is a viable method.
- When working with numbers that have a small difference, such as 4 and 6, where the sum (10) is close to the actual LCM (12), further solidifying the misconception.
- When dealing with word problems that involve finding the LCM, such as scheduling tasks or events, and students rely on addition as a shortcut to find the solution.
- When students are not provided with sufficient opportunities to practice finding the LCM using the correct method, leading to a reliance on incorrect strategies like addition."
1474,Forgets to add on the starting value when identifying a position on a number line,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify a position on a number line after moving a certain number of units from a starting point. They tend to count the units moved, but forget to add the starting value to determine the final position. For example, if a student starts at 5 on the number line and moves 3 units to the right, they might say the final position is 3, instead of adding 3 to the starting value of 5 to get the correct answer of 8.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is given a starting point of 2 on a number line and is asked to move 4 units to the left. They might answer -4 instead of -2.
- A student starts at 10 on a number line and moves 2 units to the right. They might say the final position is 2 instead of 12.
- A student is given a starting point of -3 on a number line and is asked to move 5 units to the right. They might answer 5 instead of 2."
1475,Believes y=f(-x) is reflection in the x-axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that replacing x with -x in a function, resulting in y = f(-x), will reflect the graph of the function about the x-axis. However, this transformation actually reflects the graph about the y-axis. The students may be confusing it with y = -f(x), which is the correct transformation for reflecting a graph about the x-axis.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Graphing functions: When students are asked to graph y = f(-x) and they mistakenly reflect the original graph about the x-axis instead of the y-axis.
- Function transformations: When students are asked to describe the transformation that occurs when replacing x with -x in a function, and they incorrectly state that it reflects the graph about the x-axis.
- Identifying symmetry: When students are asked to identify the axis of symmetry of a graph and they incorrectly choose the x-axis for the function y = f(-x).
- Comparing functions: When students are asked to compare the graphs of y = f(x) and y = f(-x) and they mistakenly say that they are reflections of each other about the x-axis."
1476,Thinks 1 square metre = 1000 square centimetres,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to convert between different units of measurement, particularly between square metres and square centimetres. Students with this misconception may believe that 1 square metre is equal to 1000 square centimetres, rather than understanding the correct conversion factor. This error likely stems from a misunderstanding of the relationship between the metric units, where 1 metre equals 100 centimetres, but when dealing with area (square units), the conversion is different.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When calculating the area of a room in square metres and converting it to square centimetres.
- When comparing the areas of different objects measured in square metres and square centimetres.
- When solving problems that require converting between square metres and square centimetres, such as finding the area of a floor in square centimetres given its area in square metres."
1477,"When using a scale factor greater than 1, thinks you multiply by the scale factor to go from the larger to the smaller shape.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with similar shapes and are asked to enlarge or reduce them using a scale factor. They understand that a scale factor greater than 1 is used to enlarge a shape, but they mistakenly believe that to go from the larger shape back to the smaller shape, they need to multiply by the scale factor again, rather than dividing by it. This shows a lack of understanding of the inverse relationship between enlargement and reduction.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is given a larger shape with a side length of 12cm and a scale factor of 2, and they are asked to find the side length of the smaller shape. They may multiply 12 by 2, getting 24, instead of dividing 12 by 2 to get 6.
- A student is asked to reduce a shape with a side length of 15cm using a scale factor of 3, and then find the side length of the original shape. They may multiply the reduced side length by 3 again, instead of realizing that they need to divide by 3 to get back to the original shape.
- A student is given two similar shapes, one with a side length of 8cm and the other with a side length of 16cm, and they are asked to find the scale factor. They may say the scale factor is 2 and then multiply the larger shape's side length by 2 to try to get back to the smaller shape, instead of dividing by 2."
1478,"When expressing one quantity (x) as a fraction of another (y), believes the answer is 1/x.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of expressing one quantity as a fraction of another. They mistakenly believe that to express x as a fraction of y, they need to take the reciprocal of x (i.e., 1/x) rather than dividing x by y (i.e., x/y). This error indicates a lack of understanding of the relationship between the two quantities and the concept of equivalent ratios.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the size of two groups, students may think that if one group has x items, it is 1/x of the other group, regardless of the size of the other group.
- When working with proportions, students may incorrectly write the proportion as 1/x instead of x/y, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When interpreting data, students may mistakenly believe that a quantity that is 1/x of the total is the same as x being a fraction of the total, rather than recognizing that the correct fraction is x/y.
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios, students may incorrectly apply the reciprocal of x instead of dividing x by y, leading to incorrect answers."
1479,Thinks you multiply by the numerator and add the denominator when converting a mixed number to an improper fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the process of converting a mixed number to an improper fraction. They mistakenly believe that to convert a mixed number, they need to multiply the whole number part by the numerator of the fraction and then add the denominator. This incorrect understanding leads them to perform an incorrect operation, resulting in an erroneous improper fraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 2 1/3 to an improper fraction: A student with this misconception may multiply 2 by 1 (the numerator) and add 3 (the denominator), resulting in an incorrect answer of 5.
- Converting 3 2/5 to an improper fraction: The student may multiply 3 by 2 (the numerator) and add 5 (the denominator), resulting in an incorrect answer of 11.
- Converting 4 3/4 to an improper fraction: The student may multiply 4 by 3 (the numerator) and add 4 (the denominator), resulting in an incorrect answer of 16."
1480,Does not recognise the notation for parallel sides,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify or understand the notation used to represent parallel sides in geometry, typically denoted by the same number of arrowheads or corresponding tick marks on the sides of a shape. They may not recognize that these notations indicate that the sides never intersect, no matter how far they are extended.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in:

* Identifying and working with parallelograms, rectangles, and other shapes with parallel sides
* Understanding properties of 2D and 3D shapes, such as congruent and similar figures
* Solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A student is given a diagram of a parallelogram with two sides marked with the same number of arrowheads, but they do not recognize that these sides are parallel.
* A student is asked to identify the parallel sides in a rectangle, but they are unsure which sides are parallel because they do not understand the notation.
* A student is working with a transversal of two parallel lines and does not recognize that corresponding angles are equal due to the parallel sides."
1481,"When describing a translation, miscounts when crossing an axis","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are describing a translation (or shift) of a shape on a coordinate grid. They may correctly identify the direction of the translation (e.g., ""move 3 units to the right""), but when the translation involves crossing an axis (e.g., from the positive x-axis to the negative x-axis, or from the positive y-axis to the negative y-axis), they may miscount the units.

For example, if a shape is translated 4 units down and crosses the x-axis, a student with this misconception might count the units incorrectly, thinking that the shape only moved 3 units down because they didn't account for the ""extra"" unit that was crossed when the shape moved from the positive y-axis to the negative y-axis.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When a translation involves moving a shape from Quadrant I to Quadrant IV (or vice versa), students may miscount the units when crossing the x-axis.
* When a translation involves moving a shape from Quadrant I to Quadrant III (or vice versa), students may miscount the units when crossing both the x-axis and the y-axis.
* When a translation involves moving a shape along the x-axis or y-axis and crossing the origin (0, 0), students may miscount the units because they don't account for the ""extra"" unit that was crossed."
1482,Believes you only need to multiply the integer by the integer in a integer x decimal calculation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with multiplication problems involving an integer and a decimal. They incorrectly assume that they can simply multiply the integer by the integer part of the decimal, ignoring the decimal part. This can lead to inaccurate calculations and a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplying decimals.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When multiplying 3 by 4.5, the student may only multiply 3 by 4, resulting in an answer of 12, instead of the correct answer of 13.5.
- When calculating the area of a rectangle with a length of 5 meters and a width of 2.5 meters, the student may only multiply 5 by 2, resulting in an incorrect area of 10 square meters.
- When solving a problem involving the cost of items, such as 4 boxes of pens at £2.50 each, the student may only multiply 4 by 2, resulting in an incorrect total cost of £8, instead of the correct total cost of £10."
1483,Believes vertically opposite angles sum to 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the properties of complementary angles to vertically opposite angles. They may incorrectly recall or misinterpret the definition of vertically opposite angles, thinking that since these angles ""look"" like they are complementary, their sum should be 90 degrees. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of clear understanding of the properties of angles formed by intersecting lines.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to find the measure of a vertically opposite angle in a diagram, a student may calculate the angle's supplement as 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees.

2. In a multiple-choice question, a student may select an option that states the sum of two vertically opposite angles is 90 degrees, instead of the correct answer, 180 degrees.

3. While solving a geometry problem involving intersecting lines, a student may incorrectly assume that the sum of two vertically opposite angles is 90 degrees, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
1484,Thinks 1l = 10 000 cubic centimetres,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that 1 liter (1l) is equivalent to 10,000 cubic centimeters (or 10,000 cm³), rather than the correct conversion of 1 liter being equal to 1,000 cubic centimeters (or 1,000 cm³). This error may be due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between units of measurement for volume, or a simple mistake when recalling conversion factors.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When converting between liters and cubic centimeters in a recipe or a scientific experiment.
- When solving problems involving the volume of liquids or solids in math class.
- When measuring the volume of everyday objects, such as the capacity of a water bottle or a container.
- When completing tasks that require unit conversions, such as in cooking, science, or engineering applications.
- When reading and interpreting labels or instructions that involve volume measurements."
1485,"When given an error interval for a decimal that ends in a zero, thinks you give the error interval as if the zero was not present (e.g. 1dp rather than 2dp)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to provide an error interval for a decimal measurement that ends in a zero. They tend to ignore the trailing zero and treat the measurement as if it had one fewer decimal place. For instance, if the measurement is 5.00 cm, students might provide an error interval of ±0.1 cm (1dp) instead of ±0.01 cm (2dp). This indicates that they do not fully understand the significance of the trailing zero in terms of precision and the corresponding error interval.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When measuring the length of a room as 10.00 meters and asked to provide an error interval, students might give ±0.1 meters instead of ±0.01 meters.
- When reading a temperature of 20.00°C on a thermometer and asked to provide an error interval, students might give ±0.1°C instead of ±0.01°C.
- When recording a weight of 50.00 grams on a balance and asked to provide an error interval, students might give ±0.1 grams instead of ±0.01 grams."
1486,"When using the capture-recapture method for sampling, believes you subtract the number marked second from the number caught second to find the best estimate of population size","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the formula used in the capture-recapture method. They mistakenly believe that to find the population size, they need to subtract the number of individuals that were marked during the second capture from the total number of individuals caught during the second capture. This error shows a lack of understanding of the method's purpose, which is to estimate the total population size by comparing the ratio of marked to unmarked individuals in the second sample to the total number marked in the first sample.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the population size of a fish population in a lake, a student might subtract the number of marked fish recaptured from the total number of fish caught in the second net, rather than using the correct formula.
- In a field study of a local bird population, a student might subtract the number of banded birds recaptured from the total number of birds caught in the second trap, resulting in an incorrect estimate of the population size.
- When using the capture-recapture method to estimate the population size of insects in a given area, a student might subtract the number of marked insects recaptured from the total number of insects caught in the second sample, demonstrating this misconception."
1487,Believes you can square root a negative number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of square roots, but they do not fully understand the limitations and properties of square roots. They might think that taking the square root of a number simply means finding a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. However, they fail to recognize that, in the real number system, it is not possible to find a real number that, when multiplied by itself, gives a negative result.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are solving quadratic equations and encounter a negative value under the square root sign, they might think they can simply take the square root of the negative number.
- When working with algebraic expressions, students might try to simplify expressions involving the square root of a negative number.
- In geometry, students might encounter problems involving the lengths of sides of triangles or other shapes, and mistakenly think that they can take the square root of a negative value to find a length.
- In data analysis, students might be working with data that involves negative values, and incorrectly think that they can take the square root of these values to normalize or transform the data."
1488,Confuses negative and positive coordinates when working with graphs in four quadrants,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the concept of negative and positive coordinates on a graph, particularly in the context of four quadrants. They may have difficulty understanding that the x-axis and y-axis divide the graph into four sections, with each quadrant having its unique combination of positive and negative coordinates. 

For instance, students might mistakenly assume that all coordinates in the top-right quadrant are positive, without realizing that the x-coordinate is positive, but the y-coordinate can also be positive. Similarly, they may confuse the signs of coordinates in the other quadrants.

This misconception can lead to incorrect plotting of points, misinterpretation of graphed data, and errors in solving problems involving coordinate geometry.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When plotting points on a graph, a student may incorrectly place a point in the wrong quadrant due to confusion about the signs of the coordinates.
2. When asked to identify the coordinates of a point in a specific quadrant, a student might provide the wrong signs for the x and/or y coordinates.
3. When solving problems involving the midpoint formula or the distance formula, a student's confusion about negative and positive coordinates can lead to incorrect calculations.
4. When graphing functions, such as linear or quadratic equations, a student's misunderstanding of coordinate signs can result in an incorrect graph.
5. When working with real-world applications, such as navigation or mapping, a student's confusion about coordinate signs can lead to incorrect interpretations of location data."
1489,"Believes an outlier is the smallest value in a data set, even if this value is close to the mean","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of an outlier in a data set. They mistakenly believe that the smallest value in the data set is always an outlier, regardless of its proximity to the mean. In reality, an outlier is a value that is significantly different from the other values in the data set, often being much higher or lower than the rest. However, in this misconception, students focus solely on the smallest value, even if it's not unusually far away from the mean.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A data set has a small range of values, and the smallest value is close to the mean. For example, in the data set {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, a student might incorrectly identify 5 as an outlier simply because it's the smallest value.
- Case 2: A data set has a cluster of small values, and the smallest value is not significantly different from the others. For instance, in the data set {10, 12, 13, 14, 100}, a student might incorrectly focus on 10 as the outlier instead of 100, which is significantly far away from the rest of the values.
- Case 3: A data set has a small sample size, and the smallest value is not unusually small. For example, in the data set {3, 4, 5}, a student might incorrectly identify 3 as an outlier simply because it's the smallest value, even though it's not unusually far away from the other values."
1490,Writes fraction rather than fraction of amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a fraction of a given quantity, but instead of calculating the fraction of the amount, they simply write the fraction itself. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of finding a proportion of a quantity.

For example, if a question asks, ""If you have 18 pencils and 1/3 of them are red, how many red pencils do you have?"", a student with this misconception may simply write ""1/3"" as their answer, instead of calculating 1/3 of 18, which is 6.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe requires 3/4 of a cup of sugar. How much sugar is needed if the recipe is being made for 12 people and the total amount of sugar available is 9 cups?
- A bookshelf has 24 books, and 2/3 of them are fiction. How many fiction books are on the bookshelf?
- A pizza has 16 slices, and 1/4 of it has been eaten. How many slices of pizza have been eaten?"
1491,Thinks there are 100kg in a tonne,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 kilograms in a tonne, likely due to the fact that there are 100 cents in a dollar or 100 years in a century. However, the actual conversion is that 1 tonne is equal to 1000 kilograms. This misconception can lead to errors in calculations involving mass, especially when dealing with large quantities.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- When calculating the weight of large objects, such as cars or trucks, and converting it from tonnes to kilograms.
- In science problems involving mass, such as calculating the amount of material needed for an experiment.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring the weight of goods for transportation or storage.
- When comparing weights of different objects, such as comparing the weight of a car to the weight of a large animal.
- In problems involving conversions between different units of mass, such as grams to kilograms to tonnes."
1492,Believes the whole and remainder are the other way when changing an improper fraction to a mixed number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the roles of the whole number and the remainder when converting an improper fraction to a mixed number. They incorrectly believe that the remainder becomes the whole number part, and the whole number becomes the remainder. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between improper fractions and mixed numbers, or from a simple procedural mistake.

Examples of cases where this misconception may occur:

- When converting the improper fraction 7/4 to a mixed number, a student with this misconception may write 1/3 instead of the correct answer, 1 3/4.
- When converting the improper fraction 9/2 to a mixed number, a student with this misconception may write 1/1 instead of the correct answer, 4 1/2.
- When converting the improper fraction 11/3 to a mixed number, a student with this misconception may write 2/1 instead of the correct answer, 3 2/3."
1493,Thinks the positive and negative terms in a sequence will have the same absolute values,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that in any sequence or pattern that involves both positive and negative terms, the absolute values of the positive terms will always match the absolute values of the corresponding negative terms. They may think that if a sequence starts with a positive number, its negative counterpart will appear in a predictable pattern, with the same absolute value but with a negative sign. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of how sequences can be structured and how negative numbers can be incorporated into them in various ways.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with arithmetic sequences that involve both positive and negative numbers, students might expect each positive term to have a corresponding negative term with the same absolute value, even if the sequence doesn't follow that pattern.
- In algebra, when solving equations that involve sequences or patterns with positive and negative terms, students may incorrectly assume that the absolute values of positive and negative terms are equal, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When analyzing data that shows patterns or sequences with both positive and negative values, students may misinterpret the data by assuming a symmetry in the absolute values of positive and negative terms that is not actually present."
1494,Believes 0 is not a real solution to an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that zero is not a valid or meaningful solution to an equation, possibly because they associate zero with ""nothing"" or ""no solution."" They may believe that a solution must be a non-zero number to be considered legitimate. As a result, when solving equations, they might overlook or dismiss zero as a possible solution, even when it satisfies the equation.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When solving linear equations, like 2x = 0, students might say ""there's no solution"" instead of recognizing x = 0 as a valid solution.
* In quadratic equations, like x^2 = 0, students may not consider x = 0 as a solution, thinking that a quadratic equation must have two distinct, non-zero roots.
* When solving systems of equations, students might fail to consider the possibility of a solution being (0, 0) or any other solution involving zero.
* In algebraic expressions, like 0x = 0, students may think that this equation is not true or has no solution, when in fact, x can be any value, including zero."
1495,Thinks the fraction 1/n can express sharing any number of items between n people,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the fraction 1/n as simply dividing any quantity into n equal parts, without considering the actual quantity being shared. They may believe that the numerator '1' is irrelevant, and the denominator 'n' is the only factor that determines the number of groups or shares. As a result, they may incorrectly apply the fraction 1/n to various scenarios, ignoring the fact that the numerator represents a specific quantity.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A pizza is cut into 8 slices, and 4 friends want to share it. A student with this misconception may think that 1/4 means each friend gets 1 slice out of 4, rather than considering the total number of slices (8) and dividing it among the 4 friends.
2. A bag of 12 candies is to be shared among 4 children. A student with this misconception may think that 1/4 means each child gets 1 candy, without considering the total number of candies (12) and dividing it among the 4 children.
3. A bookshelf has 18 books, and 3 students want to share them equally. A student with this misconception may think that 1/3 means each student gets 1 book, without considering the total number of books (18) and dividing it among the 3 students."
1496,Ignores grouping within a fraction and carries out the division first,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with mathematical expressions involving fractions and multiple operations. They tend to overlook the importance of following the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and incorrectly prioritize division over other operations within the fraction. 

Specifically, students with this misconception often fail to recognize that operations within the numerator and denominator of a fraction should be evaluated first, before dividing the numerator by the denominator. As a result, they may perform the division prematurely, ignoring any grouping symbols or operations that need to be evaluated within the fraction.

This misconception can occur in various mathematical contexts, including:

- Simplifying complex fractions with multiple operations (e.g., 12 ÷ (3 + 4) / 2)
- Evaluating expressions involving fractions and exponents (e.g., 1/2 × 3^2)
- Solving algebraic equations with fractions and multiple operations (e.g., 1/2 × (x + 3) = 2)

In each of these cases, ignoring the grouping within the fraction and carrying out the division first can lead to incorrect solutions and reinforce this misconception."
1497,Thinks the plan view is taken from an angle to include aspects of the side view,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of plan views and visualizing 3D objects in 2D representations. They might believe that a plan view is drawn from a perspective that incorporates elements from the side view, rather than being a true top-down view. This misunderstanding can lead to inaccuracies in their drawings and interpretations of diagrams.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When drawing a plan view of a building with a sloping roof, students may incorrectly include the slope of the roof, thinking it's essential to show its angle.
2. When creating a plan view of a 3D object with a protruding component, such as a block with a smaller block attached to its side, students may mistakenly include the side view of the attached block.
3. When interpreting a plan view of a room with a staircase, students may incorrectly assume that the staircase is shown at an angle, rather than understanding it's a 2D representation from directly above."
1498,"Does not understand that a scale factor of enlargement greater than -1, will create a larger image on the other side of the centre of enlargement from the original","Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the concept of scale factor in relation to enlargements, particularly with negative scale factors. They may incorrectly assume that a scale factor greater than -1 would create a smaller image, or that it would be located on the same side of the centre of enlargement as the original shape. 

This misconception is often rooted in a lack of understanding of how negative scale factors work, specifically how they affect the size and position of the enlarged image relative to the centre of enlargement. Students may have difficulty visualizing how a scale factor greater than -1 can produce an image that is larger and on the opposite side of the centre of enlargement.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- When a student is given a shape and asked to enlarge it by a scale factor of -1.5, and they incorrectly draw a smaller shape on the same side of the centre of enlargement.
- When a student is asked to describe the effect of a scale factor of -2 on a shape, and they incorrectly state that the image will be smaller and on the same side of the centre of enlargement.
- When a student is given a diagram of a shape and its enlarged image, and they are asked to determine the scale factor used, but they incorrectly calculate it as a positive value, or incorrectly determine the position of the enlarged image relative to the centre of enlargement."
1499,"Believes that in y = mx+c, c is the gradient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify the constant term 'c' in the linear equation y = mx + c as the gradient, instead of the actual gradient 'm'. They may think that 'c' represents the rate of change or steepness of the line, which is incorrect. This misunderstanding may stem from a lack of clear understanding of the roles of 'm' and 'c' in the equation, or from a failure to recognize that 'c' represents the y-intercept, not the gradient.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to identify the gradient of a line given in the form y = mx + c, they may incorrectly state that 'c' is the gradient.
- When graphing a linear equation, students may plot the line with the wrong steepness, using 'c' as the gradient instead of 'm'.
- When solving problems involving rates of change or slopes, students may substitute 'c' for the gradient, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
1500,"When calculating a scale factor, thinks the division is the other way around.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the scale factor between two similar shapes or objects. They may believe that to find the scale factor, they need to divide the length of the smaller object by the length of the larger object, rather than dividing the length of the larger object by the length of the smaller object. This incorrect division can lead to an inverted scale factor, which can have significant consequences in various mathematical and real-world applications.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A student is given two similar triangles, one with a side length of 6 cm and the other with a side length of 3 cm. They may incorrectly calculate the scale factor as 3 ÷ 6 = 0.5, instead of 6 ÷ 3 = 2.

2. A student is asked to find the scale factor between a model car and a real car. If the model car is 10 cm long and the real car is 5 meters long, the student may incorrectly calculate the scale factor as 10 ÷ 500 = 0.02, instead of 500 ÷ 10 = 50.

3. A student is given a map with a scale of 1:50,000 and asked to find the scale factor between the map and the actual distance. They may incorrectly calculate the scale factor as 1 ÷ 50,000 = 0.00002, instead of 50,000 ÷ 1 = 50,000."
1501,Multiplied the base numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with exponents or indices and mistakenly multiply the base numbers instead of applying the rules of exponentiation. For instance, when multiplying two numbers with the same base raised to different powers, students may multiply the bases together instead of adding the exponents. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying numbers with the same base, e.g., 2^3 * 2^4, students may calculate it as (2*2)^3+4 or 4^7 instead of 2^(3+4).
- When dealing with exponential expressions, e.g., 3^2 * 3^5, students may calculate it as (3*3)^2+5 or 9^7 instead of 3^(2+5).
- When solving problems involving the multiplication of numbers in scientific notation, e.g., (2 * 10^3) * (3 * 10^4), students may multiply the bases (2*3) and then multiply the powers of 10 (10^3 * 10^4), resulting in incorrect calculations."
1502,"When calculating the group width of a group from a grouped frequency table, believes this is found by midpoint multiplied by frequency","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating group widths in a grouped frequency table. They mistakenly believe that to find the group width, they need to multiply the midpoint of the group by the frequency of the group. This error may stem from a lack of understanding of the purpose of group widths, which is to determine the range of values within a group, rather than calculating a product of the midpoint and frequency.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the group width of a group with a large frequency, where students may think multiplying the midpoint by the frequency will give them the correct answer.
- When dealing with groups that have the same midpoint but different frequencies, where students may incorrectly assume that the group width will be different due to the varying frequencies.
- When working with real-life data, such as exam scores or temperature ranges, where students may apply this incorrect method to calculate group widths, leading to incorrect conclusions."
1503,"When drawing a histogram, thinks you plot group midpoint on the horizontal axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the x-axis in a histogram represents the midpoint of each group or class interval, rather than the entire class interval itself. As a result, they may incorrectly plot the group midpoints on the x-axis, which can lead to misinterpretation of the data and incorrect conclusions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to histograms and are not clear about the distinction between the class intervals and their midpoints.
- When students are asked to draw histograms for data sets with unequal class intervals, and they struggle to correctly represent these intervals on the x-axis.
- When students are working with data sets that have very large or very small class intervals, making it difficult for them to accurately plot the data on the x-axis.
- When students are asked to interpret histograms and mistakenly focus on the midpoints rather than the class intervals, leading to incorrect conclusions about the data.
- When students are using technology to create histograms and the software or app being used incorrectly labels the x-axis with midpoints rather than class intervals."
1504,"When multiplying surds, adds the numbers under the roots","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with the multiplication of surds, which are numbers expressed in the form of square roots. When faced with the task of multiplying two surds, some students incorrectly assume that they need to add the numbers under the roots instead of multiplying them. This error likely stems from a misunderstanding of the properties of radicals and the rules for multiplying them.

For instance, given the problem √3 × √5, a student with this misconception may incorrectly add the numbers under the roots and write the answer as √(3+5) = √8, instead of recognizing that the correct operation is to multiply the numbers under the roots.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* √2 × √7 = √(2+7) instead of √14
* 3√5 × 2√3 = √(15+6) instead of 6√15
* √11 × √2 = √(11+2) instead of √22"
1505,Thinks co-interior angles are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that co-interior angles are always equal in measure. Co-interior angles are pairs of angles that are formed when two lines intersect with a third line, and they are located on the same side of the transversal. Students with this misconception might incorrectly assume that these angles will always have the same measure, regardless of the lines or the transversal involved.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When working with intersecting lines and transversals, students might incorrectly label co-interior angles as equal, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- When solving problems involving angle sums or exterior angles of polygons, students might mistakenly apply the incorrect assumption about co-interior angles, resulting in incorrect answers.
- In geometric constructions or proofs, students might rely on the misconception that co-interior angles are equal, which can lead to flawed reasoning and incorrect conclusions.
- When analyzing and describing geometric shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, students might incorrectly identify co-interior angles as equal, leading to misunderstandings about the properties of these shapes."
1506,Believes transforming some terms in simultaneous equations is sufficient,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that by changing one or a few terms in a pair of simultaneous equations, they can easily solve the system without properly applying algebraic methods. They may think that altering a single term or variable will automatically lead to the solution, neglecting the fact that simultaneous equations require a systematic approach to solve for all variables. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of simultaneous equations and the methods used to solve them, such as substitution or elimination.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When students are given a simple pair of linear equations, they may believe that by multiplying one equation by a constant, they can immediately solve for one variable, without considering the impact on the other equation.
- When faced with a pair of equations with a common variable, students may think that by adding or subtracting the equations, they can eliminate the variable without properly considering the coefficients and constants involved.
- In cases where students are given a word problem involving simultaneous equations, they may attempt to solve the problem by changing one or two terms in the equations without fully understanding the problem's constraints and the relationships between the variables."
1507,Carries out operations from left to right regardless of priority order,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students perform mathematical operations in the order they appear from left to right, disregarding the rules of BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). They may not understand that certain operations have a higher priority than others and should be performed first.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and results, especially when dealing with expressions that involve multiple operations. For example:

Case 1: 3 + 4 × 5

A student with this misconception might calculate the expression as follows: 3 + 4 = 7, then 7 × 5 = 35, which is incorrect.

Case 2: 12 ÷ 3 + 2

A student with this misconception might calculate the expression as follows: 12 ÷ 3 = 4 is not done first, instead 12 ÷ (3 + 2) is calculated, which equals to 12 ÷ 5 = 2.4.

Case 3: 10 - 2 + 5

A student with this misconception might calculate the expression as follows: 10 - 2 = 8 is done first (which is correct), but this is just a coincidence. If the subtraction and addition were done the other way round, the student might still do them in order from left to right, even if that was incorrect."
1508,Assumes the item has not been replaced in a probability question where it has actually been replaced,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that an item is not replaced after being selected in a probability experiment, when in fact it is replaced. This leads them to calculate the probability of subsequent events incorrectly, as they assume that the probability changes due to the initial selection.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A ball is drawn from a bag, its color noted, and then put back. The student incorrectly assumes that the probability of drawing the same color again is lower than it actually is because they think the ball is no longer in the bag.
- A card is drawn from a deck, its value noted, and then replaced. The student incorrectly assumes that the probability of drawing the same card again is lower than it actually is because they think the card is no longer in the deck.
- A marble is selected from a jar, its color noted, and then put back. The student incorrectly assumes that the probability of selecting the same color again is lower than it actually is because they think the marble is no longer in the jar.

In all these cases, the student fails to account for the fact that the item is replaced, resulting in incorrect probability calculations."
1509,Does not realise that all regular shapes of a certain type will be similar,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that all regular shapes of a certain type, such as all regular hexagons or all regular triangles, are similar, regardless of their size. They may believe that similarity is determined by the size of the shape, rather than its proportions and angles.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two regular shapes of the same type but different sizes, students may think that the larger shape is not similar to the smaller one because of the size difference.
- When given a regular shape and asked to identify similar shapes, students may only consider shapes of the same size, rather than looking for shapes with the same proportions and angles.
- When solving problems involving similarity, students may incorrectly assume that two regular shapes of the same type are not similar if they have different side lengths or perimeters.
- When working with scale drawings or enlargements, students may struggle to understand that the resulting shape is similar to the original shape, even if it is larger or smaller."
1510,Believes subtraction is commutative ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the order of numbers in a subtraction operation does not affect the result. In other words, they think that subtracting a from b is the same as subtracting b from a (i.e., a - b = b - a). This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of subtraction.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When subtracting single-digit numbers, e.g., 5 - 3 vs. 3 - 5
- When solving simple word problems, e.g., ""Tom has 8 pencils and gives 2 to his friend"" vs. ""Tom's friend has 2 pencils and gives 8 to Tom""
- When working with multi-digit numbers, e.g., 24 - 17 vs. 17 - 24
- When solving subtraction problems with negative numbers, e.g., 5 - (-3) vs. (-3) - 5
- When using real-life scenarios, e.g., calculating change or finding the difference between two temperatures."
1511,Does not understand that the probability of something not happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to grasp the concept of complementary probabilities. They may believe that the probability of an event not occurring is a separate entity that needs to be calculated independently, rather than understanding that it is directly related to the probability of the event happening. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of how probabilities are connected.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the probability of it not raining on a given day, a student may attempt to find a separate probability rather than using the probability of it raining (e.g., if the probability of rain is 0.3, they may not realize that the probability of no rain is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7).
- When determining the probability of not rolling a certain number on a die, a student may try to count the number of favorable outcomes separately rather than subtracting the probability of rolling that number from 1 (e.g., if the probability of rolling a 6 is 1/6, they may not realize that the probability of not rolling a 6 is 1 - 1/6 = 5/6).
- When solving problems involving coin tosses, a student may incorrectly calculate the probability of not getting heads or tails rather than using the complementary probability (e.g., if the probability of getting heads is 0.5, they may not realize that the probability of not getting heads is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5)."
1512,"When sketching graphs of factorised quadratics, does not see that the negative of the non variable terms in the brackets give the x intercepts or the roots of the graph.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to sketch the graphs of factorised quadratics, but they fail to understand the relationship between the x-intercepts (or roots) and the non-variable terms within the brackets of the factorised expression. Specifically, they do not recognize that the x-intercepts are given by the negative of the non-variable terms in the brackets.

For example, in the factorised quadratic expression (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0, students with this misconception may not see that the x-intercepts are at x = -3 and x = 2, which are obtained by negating the non-variable terms (+3 and -2) within the brackets.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Sketching the graph of (x - 4)(x + 2) = 0, and not identifying the x-intercepts as x = 4 and x = -2.
- Failing to recognize that the roots of the equation (x + 1)(x - 5) = 0 are x = -1 and x = 5.
- Not understanding why the graph of (x - 2)(x + 6) = 0 has x-intercepts at x = 2 and x = -6."
1513,Does not know the meaning of perpendicular,"Explanation: Students may think that the term ""perpendicular"" simply means two lines that are at an angle to each other, or they may confuse it with the term ""parallel"" and think that perpendicular lines are lines that never intersect. They may also believe that perpendicular lines are only vertical and horizontal lines. This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding various concepts in geometry, such as the properties of shapes and angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing shapes, such as squares or rectangles, and the student is asked to draw perpendicular lines to create the shape.
- When solving problems involving right-angled triangles, and the student is asked to identify the perpendicular sides.
- When working with coordinates and the student is asked to find the equation of a line that is perpendicular to another line.
- When constructing shapes using a compass and straightedge, and the student is asked to draw perpendicular bisectors or perpendicular lines.
- When solving real-world problems, such as designing buildings or bridges, where understanding perpendicular lines is crucial for stability and safety."
1514,Adds instead of subtracts,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add numbers instead of subtracting them, often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of subtraction or a misunderstanding of the mathematical operation required in a given problem. This can be seen in various mathematical contexts, such as when solving simple arithmetic problems, comparing quantities, or working with word problems.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A basket contains 15 apples, and 7 apples are taken away. A student with this misconception might answer that there are now 22 apples (15 + 7) instead of 8 apples (15 - 7).
- A bookshelf has 12 books on it, and 4 books are removed. The student might say there are now 16 books (12 + 4) instead of 8 books (12 - 4).
- A person has £25 and spends £8 on a toy. A student with this misconception might think the person now has £33 (£25 + £8) instead of £17 (£25 - £8)."
1515,"When asked to take off a fraction of an amount, subtracts the fraction itself","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a fraction of a quantity and then subtract it from the original amount, but instead, they simply subtract the fraction itself. For instance, if asked to take off 1/4 of 12, students with this misconception would subtract 1/4 (which is 0.25) from 12, resulting in an incorrect answer of 11.75. They fail to understand that they need to find 1/4 of 12 (which is 3) and then subtract that value from 12.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Take off 1/2 of 15
- Remove 3/4 of 20
- Subtract 2/5 of 25
- Find the result of taking off 3/8 of 24
- What is left after removing 1/3 of 18?"
1516,Performs addition ahead of any other operation,"Explanation: This misconception is related to the order of operations. The misconception arises when students believe that addition should always be performed first, regardless of the presence of other operations in an expression. This can lead to incorrect calculations and results.

For example, consider the following cases:

- Case 1: 3 + 4 × 5. A student with this misconception may perform the addition first and calculate it as (3 + 4) × 5 = 7 × 5 = 35, instead of following the correct order of operations.
- Case 2: 2 + 10 - 3. Here, the student may add 2 and 10 first, then subtract 3, which would be correct in this instance, but it reinforces the misconception that addition always comes first.
- Case 3: 10 + 12 ÷ 4. A student with this misconception may calculate it as (10 + 12) ÷ 4, instead of following the correct order of operations."
1517,Finds unit amount but doesn't multiply up,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding the unit amount or the cost of one item, but fail to multiply it by the total quantity to find the total cost or amount. They may be able to calculate the cost of one item, but struggle to scale it up to find the total cost.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* A book costs £5 per copy, and a student wants to buy 3 copies. The student finds the unit amount (£5), but doesn't multiply it by 3 to find the total cost.
* A recipe requires 2 cups of flour per batch, and a student wants to make 4 batches. The student finds the unit amount (2 cups), but doesn't multiply it by 4 to find the total amount of flour needed.
* A toy car costs £8 per unit, and a student wants to buy 5 toy cars. The student finds the unit amount (£8), but doesn't multiply it by 5 to find the total cost."
1518,Mixes up smallest and largest when ordering decimals,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of decimal numbers and their relationships. They may mistakenly identify the smallest or largest decimal number in a set due to a lack of understanding of place value. For example, they may think that 0.9 is smaller than 0.1 because they focus on the ""9"" being smaller than the ""1"" without considering the decimal place. This misconception can also arise from a lack of exposure to ordering decimals or a misunderstanding of the concept of equivalence between different decimal representations (e.g., 0.9 and 0.90).

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When comparing two decimal numbers with different numbers of digits after the decimal point, e.g., 0.9 and 0.10.
* When ordering a set of decimal numbers with varying numbers of digits, e.g., 0.1, 0.09, 0.90, and 0.009.
* When comparing decimal numbers with the same digits but different decimal places, e.g., 0.9 and 9.0.
* When rounding decimal numbers to a specific place value, e.g., rounding 0.94 to the nearest tenth (0.9) and mistakenly thinking it's smaller than 0.9."
1519,Assumes that a graph always starts at the origin,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that the origin (0,0) is always the starting point of a graph. Students with this misconception may believe that all graphs, regardless of the type of function or data being represented, must begin at the origin. They may struggle to understand that graphs can start at any point on the coordinate plane, depending on the specific function or data being graphed.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Graphing linear equations: Students may assume that the line must pass through the origin, even if the equation does not indicate so.
- Plotting data: Students may start plotting data points from the origin, rather than from the actual starting point of the data.
- Interpreting graphs: Students may misinterpret the meaning of a graph if it does not start at the origin, leading to incorrect conclusions about the data or function being represented.
- Graphing functions with non-zero constants: Students may struggle to graph functions with non-zero constants, such as y = x + 2, as they may insist on starting the graph at the origin rather than at the point (0,2).
- Real-world applications: Students may misapply this misconception to real-world problems, such as analyzing the trajectory of a projectile or the growth of a population, where the starting point may not be at the origin."
1520,Does not recognise litres as a unit of volume,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to understand that litres (L) is a unit used to measure the volume of liquids. They may think of volume only in terms of cubic units such as cubic centimetres (cm³) or cubic metres (m³), and not associate litres with the concept of volume. As a result, they may struggle to convert between different units of volume or to solve problems that involve litres.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to measure and record the volume of a liquid in litres, but instead, they use cubic units or other incorrect units.
- When students are required to convert a volume from millilitres (mL) to litres (L) or vice versa, but are unable to do so due to their lack of understanding of litres as a unit of volume.
- When solving real-world problems involving the volume of liquids, such as calculating the amount of water in a container, and students do not consider litres as a valid unit of measurement."
1521,"Thinks that scale factors, other than one, can leave the dimensions of shapes unchanged","Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to fully comprehend the concept of scale factors and their impact on geometric shapes. They may believe that applying a scale factor to a shape can leave its dimensions unchanged, as long as the scale factor is not equal to 1. This misconception likely stems from a lack of understanding of proportional relationships and how scale factors affect the size of shapes.

In the students' minds, they might think that certain scale factors can preserve the original dimensions of a shape, possibly due to an incomplete grasp of the concept of scaling. This might lead them to incorrectly assume that shapes can be enlarged or reduced without changing their dimensions, as long as a specific scale factor is applied.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to enlarge a rectangle by a scale factor of 2, a student might respond that the dimensions remain the same if the scale factor is an even number.
- When tasked with reducing the size of a triangle by a scale factor of 0.5, a student may claim that the dimensions are unchanged because the scale factor is a fraction.
- When given a problem involving similar shapes with different scale factors, a student may incorrectly assume that certain scale factors do not affect the dimensions of the shapes."
1522,Believes the mean is total frequency divided by sum of categories given,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean in data and statistics. They incorrectly believe that to find the mean, they need to divide the total frequency (the total number of data points or observations) by the sum of categories or groups in the data set. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions about the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a survey, students are asked about their favorite colors, and the results are categorized as red, blue, green, and yellow. If there are 100 students surveyed and 4 categories, a student with this misconception might calculate the mean as 100 (total frequency) divided by 4 (sum of categories), resulting in an incorrect mean value.

- Case 2: A student is given a data set about the number of books read by their classmates, categorized by genre (fiction, non-fiction, mystery, etc.). If there are 50 students and 5 genres, the student might incorrectly calculate the mean as 50 (total frequency) divided by 5 (sum of categories).

- Case 3: In a data analysis exercise, students are asked to calculate the mean score of a test taken by 200 students, categorized by grade level (A, B, C, etc.). A student with this misconception might incorrectly divide 200 (total frequency) by the number of grade levels, rather than using the actual scores to calculate the mean."
1523,Does not know how to say a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to accurately read or express a fraction. A fraction is a way of showing part of a whole, but students with this misconception may struggle to articulate the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number) in the correct way. For instance, they may not know that the numerator is said first, followed by the denominator, or they may not understand the concept of equivalence between different fractions. This misconception can lead to difficulties in comparing, adding, and subtracting fractions, and can hinder students' understanding of more complex concepts in mathematics.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to read fractions aloud, they may say the denominator first instead of the numerator (e.g., saying ""four over five"" as ""five fourths"" instead of ""four fifths"").
- When students are asked to write fractions in words, they may write the numbers in the wrong order (e.g., writing ""3/4"" as ""four thirds"" instead of ""three quarters"").
- When students are asked to identify equivalent fractions, they may not recognize that fractions like 1/2 and 2/4 are equal.
- When students are asked to compare fractions, they may not understand that 1/3 is less than 1/2 because they are unable to accurately read and understand the fractions."
1524,Believes adding b to any integer gives a multiple of b,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiples and addition. They may think that simply adding a number 'b' to any integer will automatically result in a multiple of 'b'. This is because they may be confusing the concept of adding 'b' with multiplying by 'b'. In their minds, adding 'b' might seem like a way to create a multiple of 'b' without fully understanding the underlying mathematical structure.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to find multiples of a number, they might add that number to any integer, thinking it will result in a multiple. For example, if asked to find a multiple of 5, they might add 5 to 3 and say that 8 is a multiple of 5.
- When solving simple arithmetic problems, students might apply this misconception. For instance, if asked to find a number that is a multiple of 4, they might add 4 to 2 and claim that 6 is a multiple of 4.
- In word problems, students may apply this misconception to real-world scenarios. For example, if a problem states that a bookshelf has 3 books on it and 5 more books are added, students might claim that the total number of books (8) is a multiple of 5."
1525,Confuses written 'teen' numbers with their corresponding multiples of 10,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly associate written 'teen' numbers (e.g., 14, 15, 16) with their corresponding multiples of 10 (e.g., 40, 50, 60). This error is often due to the similar sounds or appearances of the numbers when written in words. For example, 'fourteen' might be confused with 'forty', or 'nineteen' with 'ninety'.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading or writing numbers in words, especially in the teens (11-19).
- When performing arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, involving teen numbers and multiples of 10.
- When solving word problems that involve teen numbers, such as calculating ages, times, or quantities.
- When interpreting or creating number lines, hundreds charts, or other visual aids that include teen numbers and multiples of 10."
1526,Believes that they only need to write non-zero digits when giving a number in digits,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the importance of place value in the representation of numbers. They may believe that only non-zero digits are significant and can be written, ignoring the role of zero as a placeholder in numbers. For example, they may think that the number 100 can be written as 1, as the zeros do not contribute to the value of the number in their minds.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When writing numbers with trailing zeros (e.g., 10, 100, 1000).
- When writing numbers with zeros in between non-zero digits (e.g., 101, 1001).
- When representing numbers in expanded form, where students may neglect to include the zeros in the place value (e.g., 456 as 4 hundreds + 5 tens + 6, instead of 4 hundreds + 5 tens + 6 ones).
- When solving arithmetic operations that involve numbers with zeros, such as addition or subtraction with regrouping (e.g., 100 + 25, 456 - 17).
- When comparing numbers, where the presence of zeros can affect the order of magnitude (e.g., comparing 100 and 10)."
1527,Does not know how to find missing lengths in a composite shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to break down a composite shape into its individual components, such as rectangles, triangles, and squares, to find the missing lengths. They may struggle to identify the relationships between the different parts of the shape and how they contribute to the overall dimensions. As a result, they may become confused about how to apply mathematical operations, such as addition and subtraction, to find the missing lengths.

This misconception can occur in various situations, including:

* When dealing with complex shapes that consist of multiple rectangles, triangles, or other geometric figures.
* When the missing length is not a straightforward calculation, such as when it requires the use of multiple steps or operations.
* When the shape is presented in a rotated or reflected orientation, making it difficult for the student to visualize and break down the shape.
* When the student is asked to find the missing length in a real-world context, such as measuring the length of a room or a piece of furniture, and they struggle to apply mathematical concepts to practical problems.

For example:

Case 1: A student is given a composite shape consisting of two connected rectangles with a missing length. They may struggle to recognize that the missing length is equal to the sum of the lengths of the two individual rectangles.

Case 2: A student is presented with a triangle with a missing side length, and they are given the lengths of the other two sides. They may have difficulty using the Pythagorean theorem or other mathematical concepts to find the missing length.

Case 3: A student is asked to find the perimeter of a composite shape, but they are not given the lengths of all the sides. They may struggle to identify the relationships between the different parts of the shape and how they contribute to the overall perimeter."
1528,Does not know the meaning of alternate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the term ""alternate"" in the context of angles, particularly in Geometry. They may struggle to understand that alternate angles are pairs of angles on opposite sides of a transversal line that intersects two other lines. As a result, they may fail to recognize the relationship between alternate angles, which can lead to difficulties in solving problems involving angle properties.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When identifying corresponding and alternate angles in diagrams, students may incorrectly label or identify the angles.
* When solving problems involving the angles formed by a transversal line, students may not recognize that alternate angles are equal.
* When asked to explain the difference between corresponding and alternate angles, students may provide incorrect or incomplete definitions.
* When working with shapes and patterns, students may not recognize the alternating patterns, leading to incorrect conclusions.
* When solving problems involving symmetry and tessellations, students may not understand how alternate angles relate to the overall pattern."
1529,Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (significant figures rather than decimal places),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers, but they incorrectly apply the rules of significant figures instead of decimal places. Significant figures are used to show the precision of a measurement, whereas decimal places are used to show the number of digits after the decimal point. Students may incorrectly round a number to the same number of significant figures as the original measurement, rather than to the specified number of decimal places.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a question asks to round a number to a specific number of decimal places, but the student rounds it to the same number of significant figures as the original measurement. For example, if the original measurement is 23.456 (4 significant figures) and the student is asked to round it to 2 decimal places, they may incorrectly round it to 23 (2 significant figures) instead of 23.46 (2 decimal places).
- When a question involves calculations with measurements that have different numbers of significant figures, and the student incorrectly applies the rules of significant figures to the final answer. For example, if the question asks to find the area of a rectangle with a length of 4.2 cm (2 decimal places) and a width of 5.123 cm (4 significant figures), the student may incorrectly round the final answer to 2 significant figures instead of the required number of decimal places.
- When a question asks to round a number to a specific number of decimal places, but the student is used to working with significant figures in scientific notation. For example, if the question asks to round 4.234 x 10^2 to 2 decimal places, the student may incorrectly round it to 4.2 x 10^2 (2 significant figures) instead of 423.40 (2 decimal places)."
1530,Believes a steeper downwards line on a graph means a slower decrease,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the steepness of a line on a graph in relation to the rate of change it represents. They mistakenly believe that a steeper line with a negative slope indicates a slower decrease, rather than a faster decrease. This misconception may stem from an incomplete understanding of the relationship between the slope of a line and the rate of change it represents.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Graphing the price of an item over time, where a steeper downwards line might be misinterpreted as a slower decrease in price.
2. Analyzing the temperature changes in a region, where a steeper downwards line might be misinterpreted as a slower decrease in temperature.
3. Interpreting the relationship between the amount of time spent studying and the number of errors made, where a steeper downwards line might be misinterpreted as a slower decrease in errors.
4. Examining the relationship between the amount of a certain resource used and the resulting environmental impact, where a steeper downwards line might be misinterpreted as a slower decrease in environmental impact."
1531,Believes you plot frequency rather than cumulative frequency on a cumulative frequency diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to construct or interpret a cumulative frequency diagram, but they mistakenly believe that the y-axis represents the frequency of each data point, rather than the cumulative total of frequencies up to a certain point. As a result, they plot the individual frequencies against each data value, rather than adding up the frequencies as they go along.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to construct a cumulative frequency diagram from a set of raw data, and they simply plot the frequency of each data point without considering the cumulative total.
- When students are given a frequency table and are asked to plot a cumulative frequency diagram, but they fail to add up the frequencies as they go along, instead plotting the individual frequencies.
- When students are asked to interpret a cumulative frequency diagram and mistakenly read off the frequency of a particular data point, rather than the cumulative total up to that point.
- When students are dealing with a large data set and are using a cumulative frequency diagram to estimate the median or other percentiles, but their misconception leads them to incorrectly identify these values."
1532,Forgets to include values outside of the Venn diagram when finding the total,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with sets and Venn diagrams. They may focus solely on the values within the overlapping sections of the diagram and the individual sets, but forget to include values that are outside of the sets altogether, which are often represented by the universal set. This can lead to an incomplete count or incorrect total when solving problems.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When finding the total number of students in a school, given the number of students in the debate club, the number of students in the sports club, and the number of students in both clubs.
2. When calculating the total number of books in a library, given the number of fiction books, the number of non-fiction books, and the number of books that are classified as both.
3. When determining the total number of people at an event, given the number of people who like coffee, the number of people who like tea, and the number of people who like both coffee and tea.
4. When finding the total number of outcomes in a probability experiment, given the number of outcomes in different events and their intersections.
5. When calculating the total number of elements in a set, given the number of elements in the set's subsets and their intersections."
1533,When adding powers of 10 adds onto the wrong column,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding numbers with powers of 10 but fail to properly align the digits according to their place value. They might mistakenly add a power of 10 to the wrong column, leading to an incorrect calculation. For example, when adding 100 (10^2) to 10 (10^1), they might incorrectly add the 100 to the tens column instead of the hundreds column.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Adding 100 + 10, where a student adds the 100 to the tens column instead of the hundreds column.
- Adding 1000 + 100, where a student incorrectly adds the 1000 to the hundreds column instead of the thousands column.
- Adding 10 + 1000, where a student adds the 10 to the thousands column instead of the tens column."
1534,Thinks that doubling and then doubling again is not the same as multiplying by 4,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the multiplicative relationship between repeated doubling and multiplying by a specific number. They may think that doubling a number and then doubling the result again is a different operation than multiplying the original number by 4. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition or the properties of exponents.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving multiplication problems, such as 2 x 2 x a number, students may calculate this as two separate operations (doubling and then doubling again) rather than multiplying the number by 4.
- In word problems, such as ""Tom has 5 pencils, and he gives each of his two friends twice as many pencils as he has,"" students may calculate this as 5 x 2 and then 10 x 2, rather than 5 x 4.
- When scaling up or down in measurement problems, such as ""If I have 2 groups of 2 blocks, how many blocks do I have in total if I double the number of blocks in each group and then double it again?"" students may struggle to recognize that this is equivalent to multiplying the original number of blocks by 4."
1535,"Believes that when factorising a quadratic, they can choose any two numbers that multiply to give the constant","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorising quadratic expressions in the form of ax^2 + bx + c. They may understand that they need to find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term (c), but they may mistakenly believe that any two numbers that multiply to give 'c' can be used to factorise the quadratic. They may not fully grasp the importance of finding the correct pair of numbers that not only multiply to 'c' but also add to give the coefficient of the linear term (b). As a result, they may choose any two numbers that multiply to 'c', regardless of whether they add to give 'b', and attempt to factorise the quadratic using these incorrect numbers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Factorising simple quadratics, such as x^2 + 5x + 6, where students may choose 2 and 3 because they multiply to 6, without checking if they add to 5.
- Factorising quadratics with negative coefficients, such as x^2 - 7x + 12, where students may choose -3 and -4 because they multiply to 12, without checking if they add to -7.
- Factorising quadratics with a coefficient of x^2 that is not 1, such as 2x^2 + 5x + 3, where students may struggle to find the correct pair of numbers that multiply to 3 and add to 5, and instead choose any two numbers that multiply to 3."
1536,Divides length of original by length of image rather finding length of image divided by length of original to find an enlargement scale factor.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the scale factor of an enlargement. They mistakenly believe that to find the scale factor, they need to divide the length of the original shape by the length of the enlarged image, rather than the other way around. This can be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of scale factor, which is a ratio of the size of the image to the size of the original shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given a diagram of a triangle with a side length of 6cm and its enlarged image with a side length of 18cm. They may incorrectly calculate the scale factor as 6 ÷ 18 = 1/3, instead of 18 ÷ 6 = 3.
- A student is asked to find the scale factor of a photograph that has been enlarged from a width of 8cm to 24cm. They may mistakenly divide 8 by 24, getting a scale factor of 1/3, instead of dividing 24 by 8, which gives a scale factor of 3.
- A student is given a problem where a shape is enlarged by a certain scale factor, and they are asked to find the scale factor. If the original shape has a length of 4cm and the enlarged shape has a length of 12cm, they may incorrectly calculate the scale factor as 4 ÷ 12 = 1/3, instead of 12 ÷ 4 = 3."
1537,"Believes that in completed square form, the x co-ordinate of the turning point has the same sign as the constant in the brackets.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with quadratic equations in the form of completed squares, typically in the format of y = a(x ± b)^2 + c. They mistakenly believe that the sign of the x-coordinate of the turning point (determined by the value within the brackets, i.e., ±b) is the same as the sign of the constant 'b' within the brackets. 

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with a quadratic equation like y = (x + 3)^2 - 4, where the student might think the x-coordinate of the turning point is positive because of the '+3' within the brackets.
- When analyzing a quadratic function in the form y = (x - 2)^2 + 1, and the student incorrectly assumes the x-coordinate of the turning point is negative due to the '-2' within the brackets.
- When working with a completed square like y = (x - 5)^2 - 3, and the student mistakenly believes the x-coordinate of the turning point has a negative sign because of the negative sign in front of the 5, even though the operation inside the bracket is subtraction."
1538,Does not take into account the whole amount when using a bar model to find a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are using bar models to visualize and solve fraction problems. They tend to focus only on the shaded or highlighted part of the bar that represents the fraction, without considering the whole bar as the total amount. As a result, they may misinterpret the size of the fraction or incorrectly compare different fractions.

This misconception can lead students to make errors when:

- Comparing fractions with different denominators, where they might only look at the numerators without considering the size of the whole.
- Finding equivalent fractions, where they may not account for the proportional relationship between the numerator and denominator.
- Solving problems that involve adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

Case 1: 
Sarah has 1/4 of a pizza, and her friend has 1/6 of a pizza. If they both have the same size pizza, who has more? A student with this misconception might say that 1/4 is less than 1/6 because 4 is greater than 6, without considering the whole pizza.

Case 2: 
Tom has 3/8 of a bag of chips, and he wants to know if it is more or less than 2/4 of a bag of chips. A student with this misconception might only look at the numerators (3 vs 2) without considering the denominators (8 vs 4), leading to an incorrect comparison.

Case 3: 
A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and 3/5 of the shelves are filled with books. If the bookshelf is 3 meters long, how long are the shelves that are filled with books? A student with this misconception might calculate 3/5 of 1 meter instead of 3/5 of 3 meters, because they are not considering the whole length of the bookshelf."
1539,Does not consider that all three angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize or recall the fundamental property of triangles that the sum of all three interior angles is always 180 degrees. This lack of understanding can lead to incorrect calculations, constructions, or conclusions when dealing with triangles in various geometric contexts. 

This misconception may manifest in the following cases:

- When asked to find the measure of the third angle in a triangle, given the measures of the other two angles, a student may not apply the 180-degree rule correctly or at all.
- When constructing or drawing triangles, a student may not ensure that the angles add up to 180 degrees, resulting in incorrect or impossible triangle configurations.
- In problems involving the angles of a triangle, such as determining if a set of angles can form a triangle, a student may not check if the sum of the angles equals 180 degrees, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When solving problems that involve using angle properties in triangles, such as finding exterior angles or using angle sums in triangle proofs, a student may not apply the 180-degree rule, resulting in incorrect solutions."
1540,Does not know how to simplify algebraic fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to reduce algebraic fractions to their simplest form. They may struggle with canceling out common factors between the numerator and denominator, especially when dealing with variables and expressions. This can lead to difficulties in comparing, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing fractions, as well as solving equations involving algebraic fractions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying a fraction like (2x + 4) / (4x + 8), where students may not recognize that both the numerator and denominator can be divided by 2.
2. Reducing a fraction like (x^2 + 4x) / (x^2 + 4x + 4), where students may not see that the numerator can be factored and then canceled with a part of the denominator.
3. Comparing fractions like (x + 1) / (x + 2) and (2x + 2) / (2x + 4), where students may not recognize that the second fraction can be simplified to (x + 1) / (x + 2).
4. Adding or subtracting fractions like 1 / (x + 1) and 1 / (x + 2), where students may not know how to find a common denominator.
5. Solving an equation like (x + 1) / (x + 2) = 1 / 2, where students may struggle to clear the fractions and simplify the equation."
1541,Believes reflection in y = -x changes sign of y coordinate only,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a point or a shape across the line y = -x only changes the sign of the y-coordinate, while keeping the x-coordinate the same. They may think that the reflection is equivalent to simply changing the sign of the y-coordinate, rather than swapping the x and y coordinates and changing the signs of both.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When reflecting a point (x, y) across the line y = -x, students may write the reflected point as (x, -y) instead of (-y, -x).
* When reflecting a shape, such as a triangle or a quadrilateral, across the line y = -x, students may only change the signs of the y-coordinates of the vertices, rather than swapping the x and y coordinates and changing the signs of both.
* When solving problems involving symmetry and reflections, students may incorrectly assume that reflecting a shape across the line y = -x only affects the y-coordinates, leading to incorrect solutions."
1542,Believes that a fraction means dividing the denominator by the numerator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of fractions and believe that the fraction a/b means dividing the denominator (b) by the numerator (a) instead of the other way around. This misconception can lead students to calculate fractions incorrectly, resulting in incorrect answers.

For example:

- Case 1: When asked to simplify the fraction 3/4, a student with this misconception may divide 4 by 3, resulting in an answer of 1.33, instead of understanding that the fraction represents three equal parts out of four.
- Case 2: When comparing fractions, such as 1/2 and 2/3, a student with this misconception may incorrectly compare the results of dividing the denominators by the numerators, leading to incorrect conclusions about which fraction is larger or smaller.
- Case 3: When performing operations with fractions, such as adding or subtracting, a student with this misconception may incorrectly apply the division, leading to incorrect results and confusion.
- Case 4: When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, a student with this misconception may incorrectly divide the denominator by the numerator, resulting in an incorrect improper fraction."
1543,Does not realise that a pair of coordinates can be used to find missing parts of an equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to connect the concept of coordinates to algebraic equations, specifically in the context of linear equations. They may struggle to understand that a pair of coordinates (x, y) can represent a point on a line, and that this point can be used to find missing parts of an equation, such as the slope or y-intercept.

For example, given the equation y = mx + b and a pair of coordinates (2, 5), students may not realize that they can use the coordinates to find the value of m or b if one of them is missing. They may view coordinates as solely a tool for plotting points on a graph, rather than a means of solving equations.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When students are given a linear equation with one missing variable (e.g., y = 2x + ?) and a pair of coordinates (e.g., (1, 3)), but are unable to use the coordinates to find the missing variable.
* When students are asked to find the equation of a line passing through two given points (e.g., (2, 3) and (4, 5)), but are unable to use the coordinates to determine the slope and y-intercept.
* When students are given a graph of a linear equation and are asked to find the equation, but are unable to use the coordinates of a point on the line to determine the slope and y-intercept."
1544,Thinks a variable next to a number means write the digits together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret algebraic expressions as simply writing numbers next to each other, rather than understanding the concept of variables and the operations they represent. When a variable, such as 'x', is placed next to a number, students with this misconception may think that they need to combine the digits to form a new number, rather than recognizing that the variable represents a value that needs to be multiplied by the number.

For example, when given the expression '2x', students may think that it means '20' or '2 and x', rather than understanding that 'x' is a variable that needs to be multiplied by 2.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- 3x: Students may think it means 30 or 3 and x, rather than 3 times x.
- 5y: Students may think it means 50 or 5 and y, rather than 5 times y.
- 2a + 3: Students may think it means 20 + 3, rather than 2 times a plus 3."
1545,Believes you find the surface area of a prism by finding the total area of the unique faces,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to find the surface area of a prism, they only need to find the total area of the unique faces, rather than considering all the faces. For example, in the case of a rectangular prism, students may think that they only need to calculate the area of the front, top, and side faces, without realizing that there are also corresponding opposite faces that need to be included.

This misconception can occur in the following short cases:

* When finding the surface area of a cube, students might only calculate the area of one face and multiply it by the number of unique faces (3), instead of multiplying it by the total number of faces (6).
* When finding the surface area of a rectangular prism, students might calculate the area of the front, top, and side faces, but forget to add the areas of the corresponding opposite faces (back, bottom, and opposite side).
* When solving problems involving more complex prisms, such as triangular prisms, students may fail to account for all the faces, leading to an incomplete calculation of the surface area."
1546,Believes the horizontal axis on a cumulative frequency diagram is labelled upper bound,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the horizontal axis on a cumulative frequency diagram represents the upper bound of each class interval, rather than the upper bound of each class being represented by a point on the horizontal axis, but the axis itself is labelled with the upper and lower bounds of the class intervals or just the class marks/midpoints of the intervals on the axis for the interval. This can lead to incorrect interpretation and plotting of data on cumulative frequency diagrams.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to label the axes on a cumulative frequency diagram.
- When students are required to plot points on a cumulative frequency diagram and they plot against the upper bound of the class interval, rather than at the class mark or at the end of the interval.
- When students are interpreting a cumulative frequency diagram and mistakenly assume the horizontal axis represents upper bounds, rather than the interval."
1547,Has forgotten to convert cm to m,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with measurements, particularly with units of length, and they fail to convert centimeters (cm) to meters (m) when necessary. This can lead to incorrect calculations and answers, especially when dealing with problems that require the use of different units. Students may forget to divide the measurement in centimeters by 100 to convert it to meters, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When calculating the area of a room in square meters, but the measurements are given in centimeters.
* When comparing the lengths of objects measured in centimeters to those measured in meters.
* When solving problems involving the conversion of units, such as converting the height of a person from centimeters to meters.
* When working with scale drawings or diagrams that require measurements to be converted from centimeters to meters.
* When calculating the perimeter or circumference of a shape, and the measurements are given in centimeters, but the answer is required in meters."
1548,Thinks that a unit fraction can be simplified further,"Explanation: A common misconception among students is that a unit fraction, which is a fraction with a numerator of 1, can be simplified further. This misconception arises from the understanding that fractions can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). However, in the case of unit fractions, the numerator is already 1, which is the smallest possible value. Students may incorrectly believe that they can simplify a unit fraction by dividing the denominator by a number, resulting in a decimal or another fraction.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* Simplifying the fraction 1/2 by dividing the denominator by 2 to get 1/1 or just 1.
* Trying to simplify the fraction 1/3 by dividing the denominator by 3 to get 1/1 or just 1.
* Believing that the fraction 1/4 can be simplified to 0.25 or 1/2 by dividing the denominator by 2 or 4.
* Attempting to simplify the fraction 1/5 by dividing the denominator by 5 to get 1/1 or just 1."
1549,"When asked to multiply fractions, uses the method for adding instead","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the procedure for adding fractions to multiplication problems involving fractions. They may incorrectly add the numerators and denominators separately and then write the result as a fraction, rather than multiplying the numerators together to get the new numerator and multiplying the denominators together to get the new denominator.

For example, when asked to multiply 1/2 and 3/4, a student with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the result as (1 + 3) / (2 + 4) = 4/6, instead of the correct result (1 * 3) / (2 * 4) = 3/8.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When multiplying simple fractions, like 1/2 * 3/4
* When multiplying fractions with different denominators, like 2/3 * 5/7
* When solving real-world problems involving multiplication of fractions, like finding the area of a room that is 3/4 of the way full of boxes that are 1/2 full."
1550,Believes interior angles are outside a shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify interior angles as being outside a shape, rather than within it. They may point to the exterior angles or the space outside the shape's boundaries when asked to identify interior angles. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the definitions of interior and exterior angles, or a lack of visual understanding of how angles are formed within shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to identify interior angles in a simple polygon, such as a triangle or quadrilateral, students may point to the angles formed by extending the sides of the shape rather than the angles inside the shape.
- When working with more complex shapes, such as hexagons or octagons, students may become confused about which angles are interior and which are exterior.
- When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles in a polygon, students may incorrectly include exterior angles in their calculations, leading to incorrect answers.
- When asked to draw or sketch shapes with specific interior angle measures, students may draw the angles outside the shape rather than within it."
1551,Does the reciprocal of both fractions when dividing fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing fractions and incorrectly believe that they need to find the reciprocal of both fractions. They may think that to divide fractions, they need to ""flip"" both fractions, rather than just the second fraction (the divisor). This misconception may be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of division as the inverse operation of multiplication, or a lack of understanding of the properties of fractions.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing two simple fractions, e.g. 1/2 ÷ 1/3, a student with this misconception may incorrectly find the reciprocal of both fractions, resulting in 2/1 ÷ 3/1.
- When solving problems involving division of mixed numbers, e.g. 2 1/2 ÷ 3 1/4, a student with this misconception may attempt to find the reciprocal of both mixed numbers, leading to incorrect calculations.
- In word problems, such as sharing a fraction of a pizza among a group, a student with this misconception may incorrectly apply the reciprocal of both fractions, resulting in an incorrect answer."
1552,"Believes term to term rule is applied to position number, not previous term","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that a term-to-term rule in a sequence or pattern applies to the position number of the term rather than the previous term itself. In other words, they think the rule is based on the term's position or index, rather than the actual value of the preceding term.

For example, consider a simple sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. A student with this misconception might believe that to find the next term, they need to apply the rule to the position number (e.g., ""the 5th term is..."") rather than the previous term's value (e.g., ""add 3 to 14"").

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is given the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12 and asked to find the next term. They might apply the rule to the position number (e.g., ""the 5th term is..."") instead of the previous term (e.g., ""add 3 to 12"").
- A student is given a pattern where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2. They might mistakenly apply this rule to the term number (e.g., ""the 4th term is..."") rather than the previous term's value (e.g., ""multiply 16 by 2"").
- A student is given a sequence of numbers where each term is obtained by adding 5 to the previous term. They might incorrectly apply this rule to the position number (e.g., ""the 6th term is..."") rather than the previous term's value (e.g., ""add 5 to 25"")."
1553,Thinks that we can use O as zero for place value in Roman numerals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to Roman numerals and mistakenly assume that the letter 'O' can be used as a placeholder for zero in the same way that the digit 0 is used in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. However, in Roman numerals, there is no symbol for zero. Instead, the absence of a digit in a particular place value position is indicated by the lack of a symbol.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting Roman numerals to Hindu-Arabic numerals, students might replace missing place values with the letter 'O', thinking it represents zero.
- When writing Roman numerals, students might include the letter 'O' as a placeholder, believing it will help them keep track of place values.
- When solving arithmetic problems involving Roman numerals, students might incorrectly assume that 'O' can be used as a zero and perform calculations accordingly.
- When reading and interpreting Roman numerals, students might misinterpret the absence of a digit as the presence of a zero, leading to incorrect understanding of the number."
1554,Does not know how to identify common factors from algebraic terms,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to recognize the common factors in algebraic terms, which is a fundamental concept in algebra. Algebraic terms are the building blocks of algebraic expressions, and identifying common factors among them is crucial for simplifying expressions, solving equations, and manipulating algebraic expressions.

When faced with algebraic terms, students with this misconception may not be able to identify the common factors that can be factored out. This can be due to various reasons, such as:

* Lack of understanding of the concept of factors and multiples
* Inability to recognize patterns in algebraic expressions
* Insufficient practice in factoring algebraic expressions
* Difficulty in distinguishing between common factors and coefficients

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When simplifying expressions, e.g., 2x + 4x, where the student fails to identify the common factor '2x'.
* When factoring quadratic expressions, e.g., x^2 + 5x + 6, where the student struggles to identify the common factors that can be factored out.
* When solving equations, e.g., 2x + 3 = 5, where the student fails to identify the common factor that can be used to simplify the equation.
* When manipulating algebraic expressions, e.g., (x + 2) + (x + 3), where the student fails to identify the common factor that can be combined."
1555,Believes that we cannot calculate the median of a dataset that contains negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that negative numbers cannot be ordered or compared in the same way as positive numbers, or that the concept of median only applies to positive datasets. They may think that the presence of negative numbers somehow invalidates the calculation of the median, or that the median is only defined for datasets with non-negative values. This misconception may stem from a lack of exposure to datasets with negative values or a misunderstanding of how to order and compare negative numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When given a dataset that includes negative temperatures to find the median temperature for a given week.
- When trying to find the median change in stock prices, which may include negative values representing losses.
- When analyzing the median score in a competition where some participants scored negative points due to penalties."
1556,Writes digits in the order of the pictorial representation rather than using place value columns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to write numbers represented in a pictorial form, such as blocks or hundreds charts, into a numerical form. Instead of understanding the concept of place value columns (hundreds, tens, and ones), students mistakenly write the digits in the same order as they appear in the pictorial representation. 

For example, if a student is shown 3 blocks of 100, 2 blocks of 10, and 4 blocks of 1, they might write the number as 324 instead of 324 being correct in this instance but for the wrong reason, the real problem arises with larger numbers, for instance 4 blocks of 1000, 3 blocks of 100, 2 blocks of 10 and 1 block of 1 as 4321, instead of 4321 being correct in this instance but again for the wrong reason, when the real issue will be more apparent with a different number e.g. 4 blocks of 100, 3 blocks of 10 and 2 blocks of 1 as 432 instead of 432 being correct but with different place value in the blocks but the error will be more apparent with different numbers e.g. 4 blocks of 1000, 2 blocks of 10, and 3 blocks of 1."
1557,Has an incorrect assumption about the definition of a reciprocal,"Explanation: A common misconception about the definition of a reciprocal is that students may think the reciprocal of a number is simply the number flipped or the digits reversed, without understanding the mathematical operation involved. They might believe that the reciprocal is just rearranging the digits of the original number, or that it's only applicable to fractions. This misconception may arise because students often see the reciprocal of a fraction being obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator, and they might generalize this rule to all numbers without understanding the underlying concept.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the reciprocal of a whole number, students might just reverse the digits. For example, they might think the reciprocal of 5 is 5, or the reciprocal of 27 is 72.
- When dealing with fractions, students might not fully grasp that the reciprocal is actually the multiplicative inverse, and they might apply the ""reversing the digits"" rule without understanding the mathematical reasoning behind it.
- When encountering decimals, students might struggle to find the reciprocal because they don't understand how to apply the concept to non-fractional numbers.
- When solving algebraic equations involving reciprocals, students may incorrectly apply their misconceived definition, leading to incorrect solutions."
1558,Believes dividing a positive by a negative gives a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to division operations involving negative numbers. They might intuitively think that the result of dividing a positive number by a negative number will be positive, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the concept of negative numbers or because they are incorrectly applying the rules of division. They may also mistakenly think that the signs of the numbers do not affect the outcome of the division operation.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Dividing 12 by -4: A student with this misconception will think the answer is 3, instead of -3.
- Dividing 9 by -3: A student with this misconception will think the answer is 3, instead of -3.
- Dividing 8 by -2: A student with this misconception will think the answer is 4, instead of -4.
- Solving the equation 12 ÷ x = -3, where x is -4: A student with this misconception will not arrive at the correct value of x."
1559,Believes a downward slope on a speed-time graph shows positive acceleration,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the slope of a speed-time graph and acceleration. They may believe that a downward slope on the graph indicates an increase in speed, hence a positive acceleration. However, a downward slope actually indicates a decrease in speed over time. This misconception is likely rooted in the misunderstanding of the concept of acceleration as a change in speed, rather than a change in velocity.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Interpreting speed-time graphs: When students are asked to analyze speed-time graphs, they may incorrectly identify a downward slope as an indication of positive acceleration, leading to incorrect conclusions about the motion of an object.

2. Describing real-world scenarios: When describing real-world scenarios involving deceleration, such as a car braking or an object falling with air resistance, students may incorrectly state that the object is accelerating positively, when in fact it is decelerating.

3. Solving problems involving acceleration: In problem-solving exercises, students may apply the misconception by assuming a downward slope on a speed-time graph indicates positive acceleration, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

4. Comparing different types of motion: When comparing different types of motion, such as uniform acceleration and deceleration, students may incorrectly categorize a downward slope on a speed-time graph as an example of positive acceleration."
1560,Mistakes the number of rows for the total frequency in a frequency table,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the purpose of rows in a frequency table. They mistakenly believe that the number of rows represents the total frequency of the data, rather than the actual count of data points in each category. In a frequency table, each row typically represents a different category or value, and the frequency is the number of times that value appears in the data set.

This misconception can arise when students are not clear about the distinction between the number of categories and the total count of data points. For example, if a frequency table has 5 rows, each representing a different color, students with this misconception might think that there are only 5 data points in total, rather than recognizing that each row could have a frequency of 2, 5, or 10, etc.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* A student is given a frequency table with 3 rows, each representing a different favorite sport. The frequencies are 5, 8, and 2, respectively. The student thinks that there are only 3 people in the survey because there are only 3 rows.
* A student is asked to create a frequency table for a set of exam scores, and they mistakenly think that the number of rows (e.g., 5 rows for different score ranges) represents the total number of students who took the exam.
* A student is given a frequency table with 4 rows, each representing a different type of pet. The frequencies are 3, 2, 5, and 1, respectively. The student thinks that there are only 4 pets in total because there are only 4 rows."
1561,Believes the mean is total frequency divided by something,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand that the mean is related to a division process involving the total, but they are unclear or have incorrect ideas about what the divisor should be. They might think it is the number of categories, groups, or even something unrelated, rather than understanding that it should be the total number of data points or the total frequency. This misunderstanding shows a lack of comprehension of the concept that the mean is an average value found by summing all the individual values and then dividing by the number of values.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the average score of a class in a test, a student might divide the total score by the number of questions instead of the number of students.
- In a survey about favorite colors, a student might calculate the mean by dividing the total number of responses by the number of colors mentioned, rather than the total number of people surveyed.
- When determining the average number of pets per family, a student might divide the total number of pets by the number of different types of pets instead of the total number of families."
1562,"When substituting into an algebraic term, believes they can disregard the coefficient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given an algebraic expression with a coefficient and a variable, and they are asked to substitute a value into the expression. The student mistakenly believes that the coefficient (the numerical value multiplied by the variable) can be ignored, and only the value of the variable is substituted. This means that the student will replace the variable with the given value, but fail to multiply it by the coefficient, effectively disregarding the coefficient's presence in the expression.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: Substitute x = 3 into the expression 2x. The student may write 3 instead of 2 × 3 = 6.
* Case 2: Evaluate the expression 4y when y = 2. The student may write 2 instead of 4 × 2 = 8.
* Case 3: Substitute a = 5 into the expression 3a + 2. The student may write 5 + 2 instead of 3 × 5 + 2 = 17."
1563,Thinks the order of events does not matter in a question about combined probability with no replacement,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with combined probability questions involving two or more events, where items are not replaced after being selected. Students may believe that the order in which events occur does not affect the overall probability of the outcome, which is not the case. They may think that they can simply multiply the individual probabilities of each event, without considering how the outcome of the first event affects the probability of the second event.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A question asks for the probability of drawing two specific cards from a deck without replacement, and the student thinks that the order of drawing the cards does not matter.
- A problem involves selecting two items from a bag without replacement, and the student believes that the probability of selecting the second item is independent of the first item selected.
- A scenario involves determining the probability of two events occurring in a specific order, such as flipping a coin and then rolling a die, but the student thinks that the outcome of the first event does not affect the probability of the second event."
1564,Does not recognise time as a variable from a worded scenario,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to identify time as a changing variable in a given situation described in words. They may be able to recognize other variables, such as distance, speed, or quantity, but fail to consider time as a factor that can affect the outcome of a situation. 

For example, this misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When reading a word problem about a journey: A student might calculate the distance or speed of a journey but overlook the time it takes to complete it.
- When analyzing a scenario involving growth or change: A student might recognize the initial and final states of a situation, such as a plant growing or a bank account balance increasing, but fail to consider the time it took for the change to occur.
- When interpreting a graph or chart: A student might correctly identify the x-axis as representing a variable such as temperature or distance, but struggle to understand that the x-axis can also represent time in certain contexts.
- When solving a problem involving scheduling or timetables: A student might focus on the sequence of events or the duration of individual tasks, but neglect to consider the overall time frame in which the events take place."
1565,Miscounts the area of a shape when there are half squares,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are calculating the area of a shape using square units, but they fail to account for or miscount the half squares. They may either include the half squares as full squares or exclude them entirely, resulting in an incorrect area calculation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When calculating the area of a triangle or a quadrilateral with half squares on the grid.
2. When finding the area of a composite shape that includes half squares.
3. When comparing the areas of different shapes, including those with half squares.
4. When solving real-world problems involving area calculations, such as measuring the area of a room with a partial square tile.
5. When working with shapes that have been decomposed into smaller parts, including half squares."
1566,Adds or subtracts from numerator first when solving an equation with a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with an equation involving fractions and they need to perform operations to isolate the variable. Instead of following the correct order of operations or considering the fraction as a whole unit, they incorrectly add or subtract a value from the numerator first. This shows a lack of understanding of how fractions work in equations and how operations should be applied to the entire fraction, not just its individual parts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving an equation like x/4 + 2 = 5, a student might subtract 2 from the numerator (x) instead of subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation.
- When simplifying an expression like (3x + 1)/2 - 2, a student might subtract 2 from the numerator (3x + 1) instead of finding a common denominator or simplifying the expression correctly.
- When working with a problem like 2/3x = 5, a student might add or subtract a value from the numerator (2) instead of multiplying or dividing both sides by the appropriate value to solve for x."
1567,Does not recognise suitable statistical diagrams for comparing results over time,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that different types of statistical diagrams are better suited for different types of data, particularly when it comes to comparing results over time. They may not recognize that certain diagrams, such as line graphs, are more effective for showing trends and changes over time, while others, like bar charts, are better for comparing categorical data.

This misconception can lead students to choose inappropriate diagrams to display their data, making it difficult to interpret and compare results over time. For example:

* Case 1: A student is asked to display the monthly rainfall data for a year. They choose to use a bar chart, which makes it difficult to see the trend of rainfall over time.
* Case 2: A student is asked to compare the scores of two teams in a series of games. They choose to use a pie chart, which is not effective for showing changes over time.
* Case 3: A student is asked to display the growth of a plant over several weeks. They choose to use a scatter plot, which may not clearly show the trend of growth over time."
1568,Includes the x variable when giving the equation of a horizontal line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to give the equation of a horizontal line. They incorrectly believe that the equation of a horizontal line must include the x variable, similar to other linear equations they have learned. They may think that a horizontal line's equation should be in the form of y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept, and since a horizontal line has a slope of 0, they may write an equation like y = 0x + b, or simply y = x + b, instead of the correct form y = b.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When asked to find the equation of a horizontal line passing through a given point, such as (2,3).
* When asked to graph a horizontal line and then write its equation.
* When given a table of x and y values representing a horizontal line and asked to write the equation of the line.
* When solving problems involving horizontal lines in real-world applications, such as finding the equation of a horizontal line that represents a constant value in a graph."
1569,Uses term-to-term rule as numerical part of nth term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the term-to-term rule, which is used to generate a sequence by adding or multiplying a fixed number to the previous term, is the same as the numerical part of the nth term rule, which is used to find the nth term of a sequence directly. In other words, students think that the pattern they observe in the sequence (e.g. ""add 3 each time"") is the same as the numerical part of the rule that gives the nth term (e.g. ""3n"").

For example, consider the sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. A student with this misconception might say that the nth term rule is ""2 + 3n"" because they are adding 3 each time to get the next term, instead of realizing that the correct nth term rule is actually ""2 + 3(n-1)"" or ""3n - 1"".

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A sequence is given, and the student is asked to find the nth term rule.
- A student is asked to generate a sequence using a given term-to-term rule and then find the nth term rule.
- A student is given a sequence and asked to identify the pattern and write the nth term rule."
1570,Does not understand the 3-letter convention for labelling angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of labelling angles in geometry. They may struggle to understand the convention of using three letters to label an angle, where the middle letter is the vertex of the angle. Students may find it difficult to grasp the significance of the order of the letters and how it relates to the angle being labelled. They may also confuse the three-letter convention with other notations used in geometry.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to label angles in a diagram, they may use only two letters or use the three letters in the wrong order.
* When students are given a labelled diagram and asked to identify specific angles, they may misinterpret the labels and identify the wrong angle.
* When students are working with angles in a problem, they may neglect to use the three-letter convention, leading to confusion and incorrect calculations."
1571,When writing standard form does not give the correct power of ten,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to write numbers in standard form (also known as scientific notation), which involves expressing a number as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10. Students with this misconception may incorrectly determine the power of 10 when converting a number to standard form.

For example, when asked to write the number 450 in standard form, a student with this misconception may incorrectly write it as 4.5 × 10^1 instead of 4.5 × 10^2. This is because they have not correctly identified the place value of the digits in the original number.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- When converting large numbers (e.g., 456,000) to standard form, students may incorrectly write the power of 10.
- When converting small numbers (e.g., 0.0456) to standard form, students may incorrectly write the power of 10.
- When converting numbers with multiple zeros (e.g., 400, 40,000) to standard form, students may incorrectly write the power of 10.
- When performing calculations involving numbers in standard form, students may incorrectly apply the rules of indices and arrive at an incorrect power of 10."
1572,Translates rather than reflects across a line of symmetry,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a shape across a line of symmetry means sliding or translating the shape to the other side of the line, rather than flipping it over the line. This means that instead of creating a mirror image of the original shape on the other side of the line, they move the shape to the other side without changing its orientation.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When drawing the reflection of a shape across a line of symmetry, students might draw the shape in the same orientation on the other side of the line, rather than flipping it over.
* When using real-life objects to demonstrate symmetry, students might move an object to the other side of a line without rotating it, rather than flipping it over to create a mirror image.
* When solving problems involving symmetry, students might incorrectly assume that the reflected shape will have the same coordinates or position as the original shape, but on the other side of the line.

For example:

* Case 1: A student is asked to draw the reflection of a triangle across a vertical line of symmetry. Instead of drawing the triangle flipped over the line, they draw it in the same orientation on the other side of the line.
* Case 2: A student is using a mirror to demonstrate symmetry with a shape. Instead of flipping the shape over to create a mirror image, they simply move it to the other side of the mirror without changing its orientation.
* Case 3: A student is solving a problem involving the reflection of a point across a line of symmetry. Instead of calculating the correct coordinates of the reflected point, they simply add or subtract the same value to the original coordinates to get the reflected point's coordinates."
1573,When scaling the perimeter multiplies the number of sides by the scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to scale up or down a two-dimensional shape, such as a polygon, and they incorrectly believe that scaling the perimeter is simply a matter of multiplying the original number of sides by the scale factor. They fail to understand that the scale factor should be applied to the length of each side, not the number of sides.

For example, if a student is given a regular hexagon with each side measuring 4cm and asked to scale it up by a factor of 2, they may incorrectly think that the new perimeter is 2 x 6 = 12 sides, rather than realizing that each of the 6 sides should be multiplied by the scale factor, resulting in a new perimeter of 6 x (2 x 4cm).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is asked to scale up a square with a side length of 5cm by a factor of 3, and they respond that the new square has 3 x 4 = 12 sides.
* A student is given a regular octagon with each side measuring 3cm and asked to scale it down by a factor of 1/2, and they incorrectly think that the new octagon has 1/2 x 8 = 4 sides.
* A student is asked to scale up a triangle with side lengths of 6cm, 8cm, and 10cm by a factor of 4, and they respond that the new triangle has 4 x 3 = 12 sides."
1574,Struggles to visualise 2D triangles in a cuboid,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty in identifying and visualizing 2D triangles within a 3D cuboid shape. They may struggle to recognize that a 2D triangle can be formed by connecting three vertices of the cuboid, or that multiple 2D triangles can be found within the same cuboid. This can lead to difficulties in understanding concepts such as surface area, volume, and spatial relationships.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to identify the number of triangles in a cuboid, students may only count the visible faces and neglect the hidden ones.
- When tasked with calculating the surface area of a cuboid, students may forget to include the areas of the triangular faces.
- When asked to draw a net of a cuboid, students may struggle to visualize and accurately draw the 2D triangles that make up the net.
- When solving problems involving the volume of a cuboid, students may have difficulty in visualizing the 2D triangles that form the cross-sections of the cuboid."
1575,Includes too many possibilities when calculating a combined event in probability,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when two or more events occur together, they incorrectly include all the possible outcomes, leading to an incorrect calculation of the probability. They may double-count some outcomes or include outcomes that are not possible in the given situation.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the probability of two events happening together, such as rolling two dice and getting a certain sum, students may include outcomes where the events do not actually occur together.
- When determining the probability of drawing two specific cards from a deck, students may include outcomes where the cards are drawn in a different order than specified.
- In problems involving the probability of two or more people sharing a birthday, students may incorrectly include outcomes where the people do not actually share a birthday.
- When calculating the probability of getting a certain combination of heads and tails when flipping multiple coins, students may include outcomes that do not meet the specified conditions."
1576,Divides rather than multiplies in a related calculation questions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with a problem that involves scaling or proportional relationships, but incorrectly apply division instead of multiplication. For instance, if a question asks for the total cost of a certain number of items, students may divide the cost of one item by the number of items instead of multiplying. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the relationship between the quantities or an over-reliance on division as a default operation.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe requires 2 cups of flour to make 8 cakes. If a student wants to make 16 cakes, they might divide 2 cups by 2 (the multiplier for the number of cakes), instead of multiplying 2 cups by 2.
- A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If a student wants to know the total number of books the bookshelf can hold, they might divide 8 books by 5 shelves, instead of multiplying 8 books by 5 shelves.
- A car travels 120 miles in 2 hours. If a student wants to know how far it will travel in 4 hours, they might divide 120 miles by 2, instead of multiplying 120 miles by 2."
1577,Adds instead of multiplies when using grid method,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are using the grid method to multiply two numbers, but instead of multiplying the numbers in each cell of the grid, they add them. The grid method is a visual representation of the multiplication process, where students break down the numbers into tens and ones, and then multiply each part separately. However, some students may mistakenly add the numbers in each cell instead of multiplying them, leading to an incorrect result.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Multiplying two single-digit numbers, e.g., 4 x 5, where students may add 4 + 5 = 9 instead of multiplying 4 x 5 = 20.
* Multiplying a single-digit number by a multi-digit number, e.g., 3 x 14, where students may add 3 + 10 + 3 + 4 = 20 instead of multiplying 3 x 10 = 30 and 3 x 4 = 12 and then adding 30 + 12 = 42.
* Multiplying two multi-digit numbers, e.g., 12 x 15, where students may add the numbers in each cell of the grid instead of multiplying them, leading to a complex and incorrect calculation."
1578,"When dividing a fraction by an integer, subtracts the integer from the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer and mistakenly believe that they can simply subtract the integer from the denominator. For instance, if they are given the problem 1/4 ÷ 2, they might incorrectly think that they can solve it by subtracting 2 from the denominator, resulting in 1/2. This misunderstanding stems from a lack of comprehension of the concept of dividing fractions and integers, and how it is actually equivalent to multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the integer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions in algebra, such as solving the equation 3/4 ÷ 2 = ?
- When working with ratios and proportions in geometry, like scaling down the dimensions of a shape by a factor of 1/2 ÷ 3.
- When solving real-world problems involving fractions and integers in data and statistics, such as comparing the average height of two groups of people, where one group's height is 3/4 of the other group, and then dividing that by 2 to find the average height of a subgroup.
- When converting between units of measurement, like dividing 3/4 of a liter by 2 to find the volume in smaller units."
1579,Does not realise that in standard form the decimal we use must be between 1 and 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of standard form, also known as scientific notation. They may understand that standard form is a way of expressing very large or very small numbers in a more manageable way, but they fail to recognize the importance of the decimal part being between 1 and 10. This might lead them to write numbers in standard form with decimals outside of this range, which is incorrect.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When writing very large numbers in standard form, such as 456,000,000, a student might write it as 456.0 x 10^6 instead of 4.56 x 10^8.
* When expressing very small numbers in standard form, such as 0.000456, a student might write it as 0.456 x 10^-3 instead of 4.56 x 10^-4.
* When converting numbers from standard form to ordinary form, a student might misinterpret the decimal part, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When performing calculations involving numbers in standard form, a student might not adjust the decimal part correctly, resulting in incorrect answers."
1580,"When drawing a cumulative frequency diagram, thinks you plot the frequency on the horizontal axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the frequency should be plotted on the horizontal axis (x-axis) of a cumulative frequency diagram. They might think this because they associate the x-axis with the data being counted, rather than understanding that the x-axis should represent the data values (e.g., scores, measurements, etc.) and the y-axis should represent the cumulative frequency.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When creating a cumulative frequency diagram to display the distribution of exam scores, students might plot the frequency of each score on the x-axis instead of the scores themselves.
- When analyzing data on the heights of students, they might incorrectly plot the number of students at each height on the x-axis, rather than plotting the heights on the x-axis and the cumulative frequency on the y-axis.
- When dealing with data on the number of hours spent watching TV, students might mistakenly plot the number of people watching TV for a certain number of hours on the x-axis, instead of plotting the hours on the x-axis and the cumulative frequency on the y-axis."
1581,Thinks that two side views are interchangeable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that two side views or elevations of a 3D object can be swapped without affecting the overall shape or structure of the object. They may think that as long as the same features are present, the orientation of the features is irrelevant. This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of the relationships between different views of an object and how they relate to its 3D structure.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or interpreting the front and side elevations of a building, students may think that the positions of doors, windows, or other features can be swapped between the two views.
- When creating or analyzing diagrams of 3D shapes, such as prisms or pyramids, students may believe that the side views can be interchanged without affecting the overall shape.
- When working with isometric drawings or other types of 3D representations, students may incorrectly assume that the side views are equivalent and can be swapped without changing the object's structure."
1582,Thinks terms in linear sequence are in direct proportion,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the terms in a linear sequence are in direct proportion, meaning that they think each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a fixed constant. However, in a linear sequence, each term is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term.

For example, consider the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14. Students with this misconception may think that to get from one term to the next, they need to multiply by a certain number, rather than realizing that each term increases by a constant difference (in this case, 3).

This misconception can lead to incorrect predictions about future terms in the sequence and a lack of understanding about the underlying structure of linear sequences.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- When finding the next term in a linear sequence, students may try to multiply the previous term by a fixed constant instead of adding the common difference.
- When solving problems that involve linear sequences, students may incorrectly assume that the terms are in direct proportion and use multiplication instead of addition to find the solution.
- When graphing linear sequences, students may expect to see a curve that represents a direct proportion relationship, rather than a straight line with a constant slope."
1583,Does not recognise the origin as the starting point for coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not understand that the origin (0,0) is the reference point or starting point for plotting coordinates on a graph. They may think that coordinates can be plotted from any point on the grid, rather than from the origin. This can lead to incorrect plotting of points and a misunderstanding of how to read and interpret coordinates.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to plot a point with coordinates (3,4), a student may start counting 3 units from a random point on the grid rather than from the origin.
- When given a graph with a point plotted at (2,5), a student may not be able to identify the coordinates of the point because they do not understand that the origin is the reference point.
- When trying to find the distance between two points on a coordinate grid, a student may not be able to calculate the correct distance because they are not using the origin as the starting point for their calculations."
1584,Believes if a point is reflected in the line y=b then the y coordinate of the point will become 'b',"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reflection in geometry. They believe that when a point is reflected in a horizontal line, such as y = b, the y-coordinate of the reflected point will always become 'b', regardless of its original y-coordinate. They fail to understand that the reflection of a point in a line involves finding a point on the opposite side of the line, at the same distance from the line as the original point.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly assume that the y-coordinate of the reflected point is always equal to 'b', rather than understanding that the reflection involves a change in the y-coordinate that is symmetrical about the line y = b.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* When reflecting a point (x, y) in the line y = 2, a student might think the reflected point is (x, 2) regardless of the original y-coordinate.
* When reflecting a point (3, 4) in the line y = 1, a student might think the reflected point is (3, 1) instead of understanding that the y-coordinate should be adjusted to reflect the point symmetrically about the line y = 1.
* When reflecting a point (2, -3) in the line y = 0, a student might think the reflected point is (2, 0) instead of understanding that the y-coordinate should become 3 to reflect the point symmetrically about the line y = 0."
1585,Believes distance = speed/time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly reverse the formula for calculating speed. They may recall that speed is related to distance and time, but incorrectly arrange the variables, thinking that distance equals speed divided by time. This error reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between these physical quantities, as distance is actually equal to speed multiplied by time (d = st), not divided.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a problem involving a moving object and are asked to find the distance traveled, but they incorrectly apply the formula.
- In problems where students are given a speed and a time, and they mistakenly calculate the distance by dividing the speed by the time.
- When students are dealing with real-world applications, such as calculating the distance a car travels at a given speed over a certain period, and they use the incorrect formula to arrive at an answer.
- In situations where students are working with different units, such as meters per second or kilometers per hour, and their misunderstanding of the formula leads to incorrect conversions and calculations."
1586,"When asked to read a value from a graph, thinks they give the corresponding value on the other axis, rather than reading from the graph","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reading values from a graph. They tend to think that to find a value, they can simply look at the corresponding value on the other axis, rather than looking at the point of intersection on the graph itself. This can be due to a lack of understanding of how graphs represent relationships between variables or a lack of practice in reading graphs.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is given a simple linear graph with a horizontal axis labeled ""Time (hours)"" and a vertical axis labeled ""Distance (km)"". When asked to find the distance traveled at 3 hours, they might look at the 3 on the time axis and then look directly across to the distance axis to find the corresponding value, rather than tracing the line up to the point of intersection at 3 hours and reading the distance value from there.

- Case 2: A student is given a graph showing the relationship between the amount of money spent on advertising and the resulting sales. When asked to find the sales value when $1000 is spent on advertising, they might look at the $1000 mark on the advertising axis and then look directly across to the sales axis, rather than finding the point on the graph where the two variables intersect.

- Case 3: A student is given a graph showing the temperature at different times of the day. When asked to find the temperature at 12pm, they might look at the 12pm mark on the time axis and then look directly across to the temperature axis, rather than tracing the line up to the point of intersection at 12pm and reading the temperature value from there."
1587,when reading a dash on a number line counts 1 dash too few when working out the divisions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to divide a certain range or length on a number line into equal parts. They may correctly identify the number of dashes or intervals but then miscount the number of divisions by counting one dash too few. For example, if a number line has 5 dashes between 0 and 5, students with this misconception might think there are only 4 divisions (from 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4) instead of the correct 5 divisions (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5).

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When dividing a number line into equal parts to find fractions (e.g., dividing a line from 0 to 6 into thirds).
- When measuring lengths on a number line and dividing them into equal segments.
- When solving problems involving scales or intervals on graphs or charts.
- When interpreting and creating number lines for various mathematical operations, such as addition and subtraction."
1588,Thinks only angles on parallel lines can be alternate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of alternate angles, but they develop a narrow understanding that alternate angles are only formed when two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal. They fail to recognize that alternate angles can also be formed in other situations, such as when two lines intersect, or when more than two lines intersect at a point. This misconception may lead students to incorrectly identify or overlook alternate angles in various geometric configurations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Identifying alternate angles in a diagram with multiple intersecting lines, but not parallel lines.
- Solving problems involving angles in polygons or circles, where alternate angles are not necessarily formed by parallel lines.
- Determining the relationships between angles in 3D shapes or complex geometric figures, where alternate angles may be present but not immediately apparent.
- Interpreting real-world scenarios, such as the angles formed by the shadows of two objects, where alternate angles may be present without parallel lines."
1589,Thinks the division sign means to subtract,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of division and believe that the division sign (/ or ÷) indicates subtraction. They may think that when they see a division problem, such as 12 ÷ 4, they need to subtract 4 from 12, resulting in an incorrect answer of 8. This misconception can stem from a lack of understanding of the division operation and its relationship to sharing or grouping.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When dividing a single-digit number by another single-digit number, e.g., 8 ÷ 2, the student may subtract 2 from 8, resulting in an answer of 6.
* When solving a word problem that involves division, such as ""If I have 18 pencils and I want to put them into boxes of 3 pencils each, how many boxes can I make?"", the student may subtract 3 from 18, resulting in an incorrect answer of 15.
* When solving a division problem with a remainder, such as 17 ÷ 5, the student may subtract 5 from 17, resulting in an incorrect answer of 12."
1590,Believes any two inequalities can be combined into a double inequality,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students assume that any two inequalities can be combined into a double inequality, regardless of the direction of the inequalities or the operations involved. They may think that if two statements are true, such as a > b and a < c, they can be combined into a single statement a > b < c, which is not a valid mathematical expression. Similarly, they might also incorrectly combine inequalities with different directions, such as a > b and c < a, into a double inequality.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Combining inequalities with different directions: If a student is given the inequalities 3x > 5 and x < 2, they might attempt to combine them into a double inequality 3x > 5 < 2, which is not a valid expression.

2. Combining inequalities with different variables: If a student is given the inequalities x > 2 and y < 3, they might try to combine them into a double inequality x > 2 < y < 3, which does not make mathematical sense.

3. Combining inequalities with different operations: If a student is given the inequalities 2x + 3 > 5 and x - 2 < 3, they might try to combine them into a double inequality 2x + 3 > 5 < x - 2 < 3, which is not a valid expression.

4. Combining inequalities with different coefficients: If a student is given the inequalities 2x > 3 and x/2 < 2, they might attempt to combine them into a double inequality 2x > 3 < x/2 < 2, which is not mathematically valid."
1591,"Rounds to the nearest hundredth, rather than one significant figure","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to round numbers to a specific degree of accuracy, but they mistakenly apply the rules for rounding decimals (i.e., rounding to the nearest hundredth) to situations where they should be rounding to a specific number of significant figures. 

In the case of rounding to one significant figure, the goal is to maintain only one reliable digit in the answer, with the remaining digits being eliminated or replaced with zeros. However, students with this misconception may focus on the decimal portion and round to the nearest hundredth (two digits after the decimal point), rather than considering the number of significant figures.

This misconception can lead to incorrect answers and a lack of understanding of the importance of significant figures in mathematical and scientific applications.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 432.19 to one significant figure (students may answer 432.20 instead of 400).
- Rounding 0.0452 to one significant figure (students may answer 0.05 instead of 0.05, but for the wrong reason).
- Rounding 982.76 to one significant figure (students may answer 982.80 instead of 1000)."
1592,Thinks the number of items give the number of different possible arrangements rather than using the product rule for counting,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number of items in a set directly determines the number of different possible arrangements, rather than understanding that the total number of arrangements is found by multiplying the number of choices for each item. This error is rooted in a lack of understanding of the fundamental counting principle, also known as the product rule, which states that if there are 'm' ways to perform one task and 'n' ways to perform another task, then there are m x n ways to perform both tasks.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the number of possible outfits that can be created from 3 shirts and 4 pairs of pants, a student with this misconception might answer 7 (3 + 4), instead of the correct answer 12 (3 x 4).
- When asked to calculate the number of different meals that can be ordered from a menu with 5 choices for the main course and 3 choices for dessert, a student with this misconception might answer 8 (5 + 3), instead of the correct answer 15 (5 x 3).
- When asked to determine the number of different ways to arrange 2 books from a choice of 4 books and 3 bookmarks from a choice of 5 bookmarks, a student with this misconception might answer 9 (4 + 5), instead of the correct answer 20 (4 x 5)."
1593,"When simplifying an algebraic fraction, only looks for number factors","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying algebraic fractions and they tend to focus solely on finding common numerical factors between the numerator and denominator, while overlooking the possibility of simplifying through algebraic manipulation of variables. They may not recognize that algebraic fractions can also be simplified by cancelling out common factors that involve variables, not just numbers.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly simplify algebraic fractions or not simplify them at all. 

Cases when this misconception will occur:

- Simplifying a fraction like (2x)/(4x), where students might only consider the numerical factor (2) and not recognize that the variable (x) is also a common factor that can be cancelled out.
- Reducing a fraction like (x^2 + 2x)/(x), where students may not realize that the numerator can be factored to (x)(x+2), allowing for the cancellation of the common factor (x) in the numerator and denominator.
- Simplifying a fraction like (3x^2)/(6x), where students might only focus on the numerical factor (3) and not recognize that the variable (x) is also a common factor that can be cancelled out."
1594,Believes the proportion for a pie chart sector is equal to the frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the proportion of a sector in a pie chart is directly equal to the frequency of the data it represents, rather than understanding that the proportion is actually based on the fraction of the total data that the sector represents.

For example, if a student is given a dataset with 10 people who like apples, 20 people who like bananas, and 30 people who like oranges, they may incorrectly believe that the sector representing people who like apples should take up 10/360 degrees of the pie chart (where 360 is the total degrees in a circle), the sector representing people who like bananas should take up 20/360 degrees, and the sector representing people who like oranges should take up 30/360 degrees.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Creating a pie chart to show the distribution of favorite colors among a group of students, where the student incorrectly allocates the proportion of each color based on the number of students who chose it.
- Interpreting a pie chart showing the proportion of different types of transportation used by a group of people, where the student mistakenly believes that the size of each sector is directly proportional to the number of people who use that mode of transportation.
- Comparing the proportions of different age groups in a population using a pie chart, where the student incorrectly assumes that the proportion of each age group is equal to the number of people in that age group."
1595,Believes the first multiple of a is 2a,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiples. They may think that the first multiple of a number 'a' is obtained by multiplying 'a' by 2, resulting in 2a. This is likely due to a lack of understanding of the definition of multiples, which states that a multiple of a number is the product of that number and an integer. In this case, students are overlooking the fact that the first multiple of 'a' can be obtained by multiplying 'a' by 1, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to list the multiples of a given number, they may start with 2 times the number instead of the number itself.
- In word problems involving multiples, students may incorrectly calculate the first multiple, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When solving problems involving patterns or sequences, students may misidentify the first term of the sequence if it involves multiples.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring lengths or quantities, students may make errors if they incorrectly assume the first multiple of a unit is twice that unit."
1596,Has found the total as a percentage of the amount being asked,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a percentage of a quantity, but instead of finding the percentage as a proportion of the whole, they find the whole as a percentage of the part. In other words, they invert the relationship between the percentage and the quantity. 

For example, if a shirt is on sale for £15, which is 25% off the original price, students with this misconception may think that £15 is 25% of the original price, rather than £15 being 75% of the original price (since 25% off means 75% of the original price remains). 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A bakery is having a sale where a cake is discounted by 20%. If the sale price is £8, what is the original price of the cake?
2. A student scored 30 out of 40 on a test, and wants to know what percentage of the total marks they scored.
3. A shirt is on sale for £20, which is 30% off the original price. What is the original price of the shirt?"
1597,Believes multiplying two negatives gives a negative answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to negative numbers and the rules of multiplication. They might incorrectly generalize the rule that multiplying a positive number by a negative number gives a negative result, assuming that multiplying two negative numbers would also give a negative result. This misunderstanding stems from an incomplete understanding of the concept of negative numbers and the properties of multiplication.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying -2 and -3, student answers -6.
- Multiplying -5 and -4, student answers -20.
- Simplifying the expression (-3) × (-2), student answers -6.
- Solving the equation (-2) × x = 6, where x is -3, student answers x is 3 (due to incorrectly assuming the product of two negatives is negative)."
1598,Believes the solution to an equation with matching coefficients of variables on both sides will always be 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving linear equations and they notice a pattern that when the coefficients of the variables on both sides of the equation are the same, they tend to think that the variable must be zero, as they are canceling each other out. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of how equations work and how to apply inverse operations to isolate variables. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- 2x + 3 = 2x + 5: Students may think the solution is x = 0 because the coefficients of x are the same on both sides, ignoring the constant terms.
- x + 2 = x - 3: Similarly, students may assume x = 0, neglecting the fact that the constants on both sides are different.
- 3x = 3x + 2: In this case, students with this misconception will again assume x = 0, despite the presence of the constant term on one side of the equation."
1599,Adds rather than divides when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with word problems that involve sharing or grouping objects, but instead of dividing the quantity, they add the numbers together. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the problem's context or a misunderstanding of the mathematical operation required to solve it. Students may focus on the numbers given in the problem and automatically assume that they need to add them, rather than taking the time to understand the problem's meaning and the correct operation to apply.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* If Sally has 12 cookies and she wants to share them equally among 4 of her friends, a student with this misconception may answer that Sally has 16 cookies (12 + 4) instead of 3 cookies per friend (12 ÷ 4).
* A bookshelf has 18 books, and the teacher wants to put them into boxes that hold 3 books each. A student with this misconception may answer that the teacher needs 21 boxes (18 + 3) instead of 6 boxes (18 ÷ 3).
* A pizza parlor has 24 slices of pizza, and they want to package them in boxes of 4 slices each. A student with this misconception may answer that the parlor has 28 slices (24 + 4) instead of 6 boxes (24 ÷ 4)."
1600,Thinks a lower average means the data is more consistent,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a lower average value in a dataset implies that the data points are more closely clustered or consistent with each other. They may think that a lower average automatically means less variation or spread in the data, which is not necessarily the case. 

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: Comparing the average scores of two different tests, a student might assume that the test with the lower average score had more consistent results among students.
- Case 2: Analyzing the average temperature of two different cities, a student might conclude that the city with the lower average temperature has more consistent temperatures throughout the year.
- Case 3: Evaluating the average times of athletes in a competition, a student might believe that the athlete with the lower average time had more consistent performances."
1601,Does not understand that you can have percentages greater than 100%,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that percentages are limited to a maximum of 100%, possibly due to their understanding of test scores or probabilities. They might believe that 100% represents the entirety of something, and it's not possible to exceed it. As a result, they may struggle to comprehend situations where percentages greater than 100% are used, such as when describing growth, increases, or comparisons.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A shirt is on sale for 150% of its original price. A student with this misconception may think this is impossible or that the price is only 100% of the original.
- A company reports a 250% increase in profits. The student might assume this is an error, thinking that 100% is the maximum possible increase.
- A recipe is scaled up by 200% to feed more people. The student may believe that this means doubling the ingredients, rather than tripling them."
1602,Believes the sum of change in x and change in y gives the distance between points,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the sum of the horizontal change (change in x) and the vertical change (change in y) between two points on a coordinate plane gives the distance between those points. They may think that by simply adding the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates, they can find the distance between the points.

For example, if point A is (2, 3) and point B is (5, 6), students with this misconception might calculate the distance as:

Change in x = 5 - 2 = 3
Change in y = 6 - 3 = 3
Distance = 3 + 3 = 6

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the distance between two points on a coordinate grid.
- Calculating the length of a line segment on a graph.
- Determining the distance between two vertices of a shape on a coordinate plane.
- Solving problems involving movement or displacement on a grid, where students need to find the distance traveled.
- Interpreting data on a graph, where students need to calculate the distance between data points."
1603,Confuses displacement-time graphs with velocity-time graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between displacement-time graphs and velocity-time graphs. They may incorrectly interpret the information presented in the graph, leading to misunderstandings about the object's motion. Displacement-time graphs show the position of an object over time, while velocity-time graphs show the rate of change of an object's position over time. Students with this misconception may mistakenly identify the slope of a displacement-time graph as the velocity, or confuse the area under a velocity-time graph with the displacement.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. A student is given a displacement-time graph and asked to find the velocity at a specific time. They incorrectly calculate the slope of the graph, thinking it represents the velocity.
2. A student is shown a velocity-time graph and asked to find the displacement over a certain time period. They mistakenly calculate the area under the graph, but interpret it incorrectly.
3. A student is asked to describe the motion of an object based on a displacement-time graph, but they incorrectly identify the object's velocity and acceleration.
4. A student is given a scenario where an object is moving with a constant velocity, and they are asked to sketch a graph to represent its motion. They incorrectly draw a displacement-time graph with a changing slope, rather than a straight line with a constant slope.
5. A student is asked to analyze a velocity-time graph and identify the time at which the object changes direction. They incorrectly identify the time, thinking that the change in direction is represented by a change in the slope of the graph rather than a change in the sign of the velocity."
1604,Thinks there are 10 centimetres in 1 mm.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the relationship between millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm). They mistakenly believe that 1 millimeter is equal to 10 centimeters, which is the opposite of the actual conversion. This error may stem from a misunderstanding of the metric system's prefixes, where 'milli-' means one-thousandth and 'centi-' means one-hundredth.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When converting measurements: A student may be asked to convert 5 mm to centimeters and they would incorrectly answer 50 cm.
2. When comparing lengths: If a student is comparing the length of two objects, one measuring 10 mm and the other 1 cm, they would incorrectly think the 10 mm object is longer.
3. When solving problems involving scale drawings: Students may be working with scale drawings where measurements are given in millimeters, but they need to convert them to centimeters. The misconception would lead to incorrect calculations.
4. When reading measuring instruments: When reading measurements from a ruler or other measuring instrument, students may misinterpret the markings, thinking that 1 mm is equal to 10 cm."
1605,"When rounding up from a 9, does not add one on to the digit to the left","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are rounding numbers to the nearest 10, 100, or 1000. They may correctly identify that a number ending in 9 needs to be rounded up, but they fail to add 1 to the digit to the left. This results in an incorrect rounded value.

For example, when rounding the number 49 to the nearest 10, a student with this misconception may write 40 instead of the correct answer, 50. Similarly, when rounding 99 to the nearest 100, they may write 90 instead of 100.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 9 to the nearest 10 (students may answer 0 instead of 10)
- Rounding 49 to the nearest 10 (students may answer 40 instead of 50)
- Rounding 99 to the nearest 100 (students may answer 90 instead of 100)
- Rounding 999 to the nearest 1000 (students may answer 900 instead of 1000)"
1606,Believes the coefficent of x in an expanded quadratic comes from multiplying the two numbers in the brackets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to expanding quadratic expressions in the form of (x+a)(x+b). They mistakenly believe that the coefficient of the x term in the expanded expression is obtained by simply multiplying the two constants 'a' and 'b' together, rather than understanding the correct process of multiplying out the brackets using the distributive property.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Expanding (x+3)(x+4), where students may think the coefficient of x is 3*4=12.
* Expanding (x-2)(x+5), where students may think the coefficient of x is -2*5=-10.
* Expanding (x+2)(x-3), where students may think the coefficient of x is 2*-3=-6."
1607,Believes the gradient of perpendicular lines just have opposite signs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand that perpendicular lines have some relationship between their gradients, but mistakenly believe that simply changing the sign of the gradient of one line will result in a perpendicular line. For example, they may think that if a line has a gradient of 2, a line perpendicular to it will have a gradient of -2, without considering the actual relationship between the gradients of perpendicular lines. 

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When finding the equation of a line perpendicular to a given line, students may simply change the sign of the gradient without considering the correct relationship.
- When identifying whether two lines are perpendicular, students may incorrectly conclude that lines with gradients of, for example, 3 and -4 are perpendicular simply because they have opposite signs, without checking if the product of their gradients is -1.
- When graphing, students may draw a line that they believe is perpendicular to a given line, but actually isn't, due to their misunderstanding of the relationship between the gradients."
1608,Believes parts of a 3D diagram that look straight class as edges,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify any straight line on a 3D diagram as an edge. However, not all straight lines on a 3D diagram are edges. Edges are the lines where two faces of a 3D shape meet, whereas some straight lines on a diagram may be lines within a face, lines that are part of the background, or lines created by the intersection of two planes that don't necessarily form an edge.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When students are asked to count the number of edges on a 3D shape, they may include lines within a face, resulting in an incorrect count.
- Case 2: When drawing 3D shapes, students may draw extra lines that they believe are edges, creating an inaccurate representation of the shape.
- Case 3: When identifying the properties of 3D shapes, such as the number of edges, faces, and vertices, students may incorrectly include lines that are not edges, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- Case 4: When working with diagrams that involve shading or cross-sections, students may misinterpret lines created by shading or cross-sections as edges of the 3D shape."
1609,Believes the decimal point button writes a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the decimal point button on a calculator is used to write fractions, rather than understanding that it is used to indicate a decimal point in a number. For example, they may think that pressing ""2"", ""."", and ""5"" on the calculator will result in the fraction 2/5, rather than the decimal number 2.5.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to enter the fraction 3/4 on a calculator, a student with this misconception may press ""3"", ""."", and ""4"", expecting the calculator to display the fraction.
- When given a math problem that requires converting a fraction to a decimal, such as 2/5, a student with this misconception may simply press ""2"", ""."", and ""5"" on the calculator and expect the correct answer.
- When working with decimal numbers, a student with this misconception may become confused when the calculator displays a decimal number, such as 0.75, and may try to convert it to a fraction using the decimal point button."
1610,Misunderstands the concept of common factors in algebra,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to grasp the idea of common factors in algebraic expressions. They may think that a common factor is simply a number or variable that appears in each term, without understanding that it must be a factor that divides each term evenly. This can lead to incorrect identification of common factors, resulting in incorrect simplification or factorization of expressions.

For example, students with this misconception may:

- Identify 2 as a common factor in the expression 2x + 3y, simply because 2 appears in one of the terms, without recognizing that 2 does not divide 3y.
- Fail to identify x as a common factor in the expression x^2 + 2x, because they don't recognize that x is a factor that divides both terms.
- Incorrectly factor out a common factor, such as factoring 2x out of the expression 2x + 2y to get 2x(1 + y), without recognizing that this is not a valid factorization."
1611,Does not understand that coordinates can be decimals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are only exposed to coordinates with integer values (e.g., (3, 4) or (5, 2)) and are not introduced to the concept that coordinates can also be decimals (e.g., (3.5, 2.7) or (4.2, 5.8)). As a result, they may struggle to plot points or read coordinates with decimal values, assuming that coordinates are always whole numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to plot a point with decimal coordinates on a graph, such as (2.5, 3.8).
2. When reading coordinates from a graph and the coordinates have decimal values, such as (1.2, 4.9).
3. When solving problems that involve midpoints or dividing line segments, which may result in decimal coordinates.
4. When working with real-world applications, such as mapping or navigation, where coordinates are often in decimal form.
5. When using technology, such as graphing calculators or computer software, that can produce decimal coordinates, but the student is unsure how to interpret them."
1612,Confuses the shaded and unshaded regions on an inequality diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty interpreting the shaded and unshaded regions on a number line or graph that represents an inequality. They may mistakenly believe that the shaded region represents the values that do not satisfy the inequality, and the unshaded region represents the values that do satisfy the inequality, or vice versa. This confusion can lead to incorrect conclusions about the solution set of the inequality.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing a simple linear inequality on a number line, such as x > 3 or x ≤ 5, students may shade the wrong region.
- When solving quadratic inequalities, such as x^2 + 2x - 3 > 0, students may misinterpret the shaded regions on the graph, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with systems of linear inequalities, students may struggle to identify the correct shaded region that satisfies all the inequalities.
- When using inequality diagrams to solve problems in real-world contexts, such as finding the range of values for a variable in a scientific experiment, students may misinterpret the shaded region, leading to incorrect conclusions."
1613,Believes constructing a triangle with given SAS requires a compass,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a compass is necessary to construct a triangle when given two sides and the included angle (SAS). They may think that the compass is needed to draw the third side of the triangle, not realizing that the given angle and two sides provide enough information to complete the triangle using a ruler and possibly other geometric tools, but not necessarily a compass.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to construct a triangle with two given sides and the included angle in a geometry lesson.
- When solving a problem involving triangle construction in a math competition or assessment.
- When working on a project that involves designing or building a structure with specific triangular dimensions.
- When helping a peer with a geometry problem and incorrectly advising them to use a compass for a SAS construction."
1614,Believes factors of algebraic terms/expressions will only be numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factoring in algebra and assume that the factors will always be numerical values, just like in basic arithmetic factoring (e.g., factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12). They may struggle to understand that algebraic expressions can also have non-numerical factors, such as variables or a combination of variables and numbers.

This misconception can lead to difficulties when students are asked to factor algebraic expressions that involve variables, such as:

* Factoring out a common variable: 2x + 4x = ?
* Factoring a quadratic expression: x^2 + 5x + 6 = ?
* Factoring an expression with both numbers and variables: 3x^2 + 6x + 9 = ?

In these cases, students who hold this misconception may incorrectly assume that the factors will only be numbers and fail to consider the role of variables in the factoring process."
1615,Does not know the symbol for proportionality ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize or use the symbol for proportionality, which is often represented as ""∝"". Students may struggle to understand that this symbol indicates a relationship between two quantities where one quantity changes in direct proportion to the other. They may confuse it with the equals sign (=) or other mathematical symbols, or they may not be familiar with the concept of proportionality altogether.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When students are asked to write an equation to represent a proportional relationship, they may use the wrong symbol or no symbol at all.
* When reading a graph or chart, students may misinterpret the relationship between two variables if they do not recognize the proportionality symbol.
* In word problems involving proportionality, students may fail to identify the relationship between the variables and therefore struggle to solve the problem.
* In science and other subjects, students may encounter proportionality in real-world applications, such as the relationship between force and acceleration, but may not be able to recognize or apply the concept due to their unfamiliarity with the symbol."
1616,Fails to consider all possible outcomes,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not account for every possible outcome or result in a situation, often leading to inaccurate or incomplete conclusions. In mathematics, particularly in Data and Statistics, and Probability, considering all possible outcomes is crucial for making informed decisions or predictions.

In the context of Data and Statistics, this misconception might manifest when students are:

- Calculating probabilities: Students may overlook certain outcomes or possibilities, resulting in incorrect probability calculations.
- Creating sample spaces: Students may not include all possible outcomes in the sample space, leading to incomplete or biased results.
- Interpreting data: Students might focus on a limited set of data, ignoring other relevant information that could impact their conclusions.

For example, this misconception might occur in the following cases:

- A student is asked to calculate the probability of rolling a certain number on a fair six-sided die. They might only consider the desired outcome and not account for the other five possible outcomes.
- When creating a sample space for a coin toss, a student might only include the outcomes ""heads"" and ""tails"" but forget to consider the possibility of the coin landing on its edge.
- In a survey, a student might only analyze the responses from one group, ignoring the responses from other groups that could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data."
1617,Believes a reciprocal equation will have a linear graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to reciprocal equations, typically in the form of y = 1/x or y = k/x where k is a constant. They may mistakenly believe that the graph of such an equation will be a straight line, possibly due to their prior experience with linear equations. They may not fully understand the relationship between the variables in a reciprocal equation, which is not a straightforward, constant rate of change as seen in linear equations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing simple reciprocal equations, such as y = 1/x, and expecting a straight-line graph.
- When solving problems involving real-world applications of reciprocal relationships, such as the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task, and incorrectly assuming a linear relationship.
- When comparing the graphs of linear and reciprocal equations and failing to recognize the distinct characteristics of each type of graph.
- When attempting to find the equation of a reciprocal graph and incorrectly applying the formula for a linear equation."
1618,Mixes up cubing and multiplying by 3,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that cubing a number (raising it to the power of 3) is the same as multiplying the number by 3. They may think that, for example, 4 cubed (4³) is equal to 4 multiplied by 3 (4 × 3), rather than understanding that 4 cubed means 4 multiplied by itself three times (4 × 4 × 4).

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When calculating the volume of a cube, students might multiply the length of the side by 3 instead of cubing it.
- When solving algebraic expressions, students might simplify expressions like x³ as 3x instead of recognizing it as x multiplied by itself three times.
- When working with numerical calculations, students might calculate 2³ as 2 × 3 = 6, instead of 2 × 2 × 2 = 8.

This misconception highlights the need for students to understand the concept of exponentiation and the difference between multiplying a number by a fixed value and raising it to a power."
1619,"When dividing a decimal by a whole number, ignores decimal point and just divides the digits","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a decimal number by a whole number. They tend to ignore the decimal point and simply divide the digits as if they were whole numbers. This is likely because students are more familiar with whole number division and may not fully understand the concept of decimal division. As a result, they might treat the decimal number as a whole number, disregarding the decimal point and the place value of the digits.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- 4.8 ÷ 2 = ? (Student answer: 24, ignoring the decimal point and simply dividing 48 by 2)
- 3.6 ÷ 3 = ? (Student answer: 12, ignoring the decimal point and simply dividing 36 by 3)
- 2.4 ÷ 4 = ? (Student answer: 6, ignoring the decimal point and simply dividing 24 by 4)

This misconception can lead to incorrect answers and demonstrate a lack of understanding of decimal division and place value concepts."
1620,Believes zero cannot be raised to a power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of exponents and powers, but they fail to understand that zero can be raised to a power. They may believe that since any number multiplied by zero results in zero, raising zero to a power is either undefined or always results in zero, regardless of the exponent. They may also struggle to comprehend that any non-zero number raised to the power of zero equals one, but zero raised to the power of zero is a special case. This misconception can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of exponents and the special case of zero.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: When simplifying expressions like 0^2 or 0^5, students with this misconception may say that it's undefined or can't be done.
2. Solving equations: In equations like 0^x = 0, students may not consider the possibility of x being any number, thinking that zero can't be raised to a power.
3. Graphing functions: When graphing functions that involve exponents, like y = x^2, students may struggle to understand what happens to the function when x is zero, if they believe zero can't be raised to a power.
4. Interpreting scientific notation: Students with this misconception may struggle to interpret numbers written in scientific notation, such as 0 × 10^5, thinking that the zero can't be raised to the power of 5."
1621,"When dividing a fraction by an integer, multiplies both the numerator and denominator by the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer and mistakenly apply the rule of equivalent fractions, which states that multiplying the numerator and denominator of a fraction by the same number does not change the value of the fraction. However, in the case of dividing a fraction by an integer, students incorrectly assume that multiplying both the numerator and denominator by the integer will give the correct result. This is not the case, as dividing a fraction by an integer is equivalent to multiplying the fraction by the reciprocal of the integer.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* 1/2 ÷ 3 = ? (student incorrectly multiplies both numerator and denominator by 3, resulting in 3/6, instead of multiplying 1/2 by the reciprocal of 3, which is 1/3)
* 3/4 ÷ 2 = ? (student incorrectly multiplies both numerator and denominator by 2, resulting in 6/8, instead of multiplying 3/4 by the reciprocal of 2, which is 1/2)
* 2/3 ÷ 4 = ? (student incorrectly multiplies both numerator and denominator by 4, resulting in 8/12, instead of multiplying 2/3 by the reciprocal of 4, which is 1/4)"
1622,Divides by 1000 instead of 100 when converting a percentage to a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting percentages to decimals, but they incorrectly assume that since percentages involve three digits or a 'percent' sign (%), the conversion involves dividing by 1000 instead of 100. They may think of percentages as a three-digit place (hundreds, tens, ones) rather than as a two-digit place (tens, ones) with the percentage sign as an indicator of 'out of 100'. This error can stem from a misunderstanding of place value or an incomplete grasp of the concept of percentages.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A shirt is on sale with a 25% discount. If the original price is £100, a student with this misconception might calculate the discount as £100 * 25 ÷ 1000, resulting in a £2.50 discount instead of the correct £25 discount.
2. A recipe calls for a 50% increase in the amount of sugar. If the original amount is 200g, a student with this misconception might calculate the increase as 200g * 50 ÷ 1000, resulting in a 10g increase instead of the correct 100g increase.
3. A student scored 80% on a test, and they want to convert this to a decimal. With this misconception, they would divide 80 by 1000, resulting in 0.08 instead of the correct 0.8."
1623,"When asked for the mean of a list of data, does not count any zeros in the data when working out what to divide by","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the mean of a set of data and they exclude any zeros from the total count of numbers. They may believe that zeros do not contribute to the overall mean or are irrelevant when dividing the sum of the data by the total count of numbers. As a result, they may calculate the mean by dividing the sum of the non-zero numbers by the count of non-zero numbers, rather than dividing the sum of all numbers (including zeros) by the total count of numbers.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When calculating the average score of a test and some students scored zero.
* When finding the mean temperature of a set of daily temperature readings that include zero degrees.
* When calculating the mean number of goals scored by a team in a series of games, and some games resulted in zero goals.
* When determining the average amount of rainfall in a region over a period of time, and some days had zero rainfall.
* When calculating the mean number of hours worked by employees in a week, and some employees worked zero hours."
1624,Multiplies the number of whole units by the numerator when converting from a mixed number to an improper fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting a mixed number to an improper fraction. They mistakenly multiply the whole number part by the numerator of the fraction, instead of multiplying the whole number part by the denominator and then adding the numerator. This error demonstrates a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the relationship between mixed numbers and improper fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 2 1/3 to an improper fraction: A student may multiply 2 by 1 and add 3, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- Converting 3 2/5 to an improper fraction: A student may multiply 3 by 2, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- Converting 1 3/4 to an improper fraction: A student may multiply 1 by 3, resulting in an incorrect answer."
1625,Uses difference as index instead of coefficient in nth term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use the difference between consecutive terms as the index (n) in the nth term rule of a sequence, instead of using it as the coefficient of n. The nth term rule is a formula used to find any term in a sequence, and it typically involves the index n and a constant difference or coefficient. Students with this misconception may incorrectly substitute the difference between terms as the variable n, rather than multiplying it by n.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence, a student may write the rule as: nth term = first term + (difference) instead of nth term = first term + (difference) × n.
* When generating a sequence, a student may add a fixed number (the difference) to the previous term, but incorrectly write the nth term rule using the difference as the index, e.g., nth term = first term + difference, instead of using the difference as the coefficient of n.
* When solving problems involving sequences, a student may mistakenly apply the difference as the index, leading to incorrect calculations and answers."
1626,Has partitioned the digits when doing long multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly partition or separate the digits of a multi-digit number during the process of long multiplication. Instead of correctly multiplying each digit of one number by each digit of the other number, they may incorrectly group or separate the digits, leading to an incorrect calculation.

For example, when multiplying 43 by 27, a student with this misconception might incorrectly partition the digits as follows:

* Multiply 40 by 20, then multiply 3 by 7, and finally add the results, ignoring the correct place value and multiplication process.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Multiplying 45 by 19: A student may partition 45 as 40 and 5, and 19 as 10 and 9, and then perform the multiplication incorrectly.
* Multiplying 93 by 47: A student may separate 93 into 90 and 3, and 47 into 40 and 7, leading to an incorrect calculation.
* Multiplying 124 by 35: A student may incorrectly partition 124 as 100, 20, and 4, and 35 as 30 and 5, resulting in an incorrect product."
1627,Believes ratios can be combined without equalizing common terms,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that they can directly add or combine ratios without considering the relationship between their corresponding terms. They may think that ratios can be treated like simple fractions and added directly, without the need to find a common term or denominator.

For example, when given two ratios, such as 2:3 and 3:4, students with this misconception may incorrectly combine them as 2:3 + 3:4 = 5:7, without recognizing the need to equalize the common terms. This can lead to incorrect conclusions and a lack of understanding of the true relationship between the ratios.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When comparing the ingredients of two recipes, students may incorrectly combine the ratios of ingredients without considering the common terms.
* When analyzing the proportions of different components in a mixture, students may mistakenly add the ratios without equalizing the common terms.
* When working with equivalent ratios, students may incorrectly simplify or combine the ratios without considering the relationships between the corresponding terms."
1628,"When multiplying involving a multiple of 10, gives an answer 10 times smaller than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying by multiples of 10. They may incorrectly assume that multiplying by a multiple of 10 means simply adding a 0 to the original number, but they place the decimal point incorrectly, resulting in an answer that is 10 times smaller than the correct answer. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of place value and the concept of multiplying by powers of 10.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* 4 x 50 = 4.0 (instead of 200)
* 3 x 100 = 3.00 (instead of 300)
* 2 x 200 = 2.0 (instead of 400)
* 5 x 10 = 0.5 (instead of 50)"
1629,writes the remainder as the divisor divided by 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers and finding remainders. Instead of understanding that the remainder is the amount left over after dividing one number by another, they mistakenly believe that the remainder is found by dividing the divisor (the number by which we are dividing) by 10. 

For example, when dividing 43 by 7, the student may write the remainder as 7 divided by 10, which equals 0.7, rather than finding the actual remainder of 1 (43 = 6 x 7 + 1). This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of remainders and the division process.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:
- Dividing 75 by 9: Student writes the remainder as 9 divided by 10, which equals 0.9, instead of the actual remainder of 3.
- Dividing 27 by 4: Student writes the remainder as 4 divided by 10, which equals 0.4, instead of the actual remainder of 3.
- Dividing 98 by 11: Student writes the remainder as 11 divided by 10, which equals 1.1, instead of the actual remainder of 7."
1630,Does not realize we can simplify a term that involves powers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with expressions that involve exponents or powers, but they fail to recognize the opportunity to simplify the term. They might treat each part of the expression separately, without understanding the rules of exponents that allow for simplification. This can lead to lengthy and complicated calculations, rather than using the properties of exponents to simplify the expression.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions with the same base, e.g., 2^3 * 2^4.
2. Simplifying expressions with a power of 0, e.g., 3^0.
3. Simplifying expressions with a power of 1, e.g., 2^1.
4. Simplifying expressions with negative exponents, e.g., 2^-3.
5. Simplifying expressions with fractional exponents, e.g., 2^(1/2)."
1631,When asked for a specific term in a sequence gives the term after,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify a specific term in a sequence, but instead of providing the term at the requested position, they give the term that comes after it. This indicates that the student may be misunderstanding the concept of term positions in a sequence or have difficulty in counting the terms correctly.

For example, if a sequence is given as 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and the student is asked to find the third term, they might incorrectly respond with ""8"" (which is the fourth term) instead of ""6"" (which is the actual third term).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying the nth term in an arithmetic sequence, such as finding the 5th term in the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
- When working with geometric sequences, such as finding the 4th term in the sequence 2, 6, 18, ...
- When solving problems involving patterns, such as ""If the pattern is add 2, and the sequence starts with 5, what is the 6th term?""
- When analyzing number sequences in real-life contexts, such as population growth or financial transactions."
1632,"Believes a decimal with one significant figure is a multiple of 10 when converted to a percentage, regardless of place value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between decimals, significant figures, and percentages. They incorrectly assume that any decimal with one significant figure, regardless of its place value, will automatically become a multiple of 10 when converted to a percentage. 

For example, they may think that 0.4 (one significant figure) will become 40% (a multiple of 10) when converted, which is correct. However, they may also apply this same logic to decimals with one significant figure but different place values, such as 0.04 or 4.0.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- Converting 0.04 to a percentage: A student might think it becomes 40% instead of 4%.
- Converting 4.0 to a percentage: A student might think it becomes 400% instead of 400% (which is correct in this case but for the wrong reason).
- Converting 0.004 to a percentage: A student might think it becomes 40% instead of 0.4%."
1633,When asked to rotate by 180 degrees rotates by 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of rotation in geometry. They may struggle to visualize or comprehend the magnitude of a 180-degree rotation, which is equivalent to a half-turn. As a result, they mistakenly rotate the object or shape by 90 degrees, which is only a quarter-turn. This could be due to a lack of spatial awareness, difficulty with visualizing transformations, or an incomplete understanding of angular measurements.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to rotate a shape on a grid or coordinate plane by 180 degrees, they might only move it 90 degrees, resulting in an incorrect orientation.
* In real-world applications, such as design or architecture, students might mistakenly rotate an object or structure by 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees, affecting the overall layout or functionality.
* When solving problems involving symmetry, students may incorrectly assume that a 90-degree rotation is equivalent to a 180-degree rotation, leading to incorrect conclusions about the symmetry of a shape or pattern."
1634,"When performing mental multiplication, multiplies accurately by a multiple of 10 but then does not know how to adjust their answer ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are able to multiply a number by a multiple of 10 (e.g., 10, 20, 30) accurately, but struggle to adjust their answer when the multiplier is not a multiple of 10. For example, a student may know that 4 × 10 = 40, but when asked to calculate 4 × 11, they may not know how to adjust their answer to get the correct result.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When multiplying a single-digit number by a number that is one more or one less than a multiple of 10 (e.g., 4 × 11, 5 × 9).
* When multiplying a multi-digit number by a number that is a multiple of 10 plus or minus a small number (e.g., 24 × 11, 36 × 9).
* When solving real-world problems that involve multiplying quantities that are close to, but not exactly, multiples of 10 (e.g., calculating the cost of 11 items that cost $4 each)."
1635,Believes gradient is the difference between the change in x and the change in y,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient, which is a fundamental idea in mathematics, particularly in the context of coordinate geometry and graphing. The misconception suggests that the gradient is simply the difference between the change in x-coordinates and the change in y-coordinates. However, this oversimplification neglects the importance of the ratio between these changes, leading to incorrect calculations and interpretations of gradients.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the gradient of a straight line: Students may subtract the change in x from the change in y instead of dividing the change in y by the change in x.
- When comparing the steepness of different lines: Students may incorrectly compare the differences in x and y instead of comparing the ratios of the changes.
- When applying gradient in real-world problems: Students may misinterpret the physical meaning of gradient, such as the steepness of a slope or the rate of change of a quantity, due to their misunderstanding of the concept.
- When working with non-linear relationships: Students may incorrectly apply their misconceived understanding of gradient to non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect conclusions about the rate of change or steepness of the curve."
1636,Believes nth term rule can be given in words,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the nth term rule of a sequence can be expressed using words alone, without the need for a mathematical formula or algebraic expression. They may think that describing the pattern of the sequence in words is sufficient to define the nth term rule. 

For example, if a sequence is formed by adding 3 to the previous term, a student with this misconception might say that the nth term rule is ""add 3 each time"" instead of recognizing that the rule can be expressed algebraically as a formula such as a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, n is the term number, and d is the common difference.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Describing the pattern of a simple arithmetic sequence, such as 2, 5, 8, 11, ...
- Explaining the rule for a geometric sequence, like 2, 6, 18, 54, ...
- Identifying the nth term rule for a sequence that follows a straightforward pattern, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
- Writing the nth term rule for a sequence that has a clear, repetitive structure, like 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ..."
1637,Has used the decimal point to separate numerator and denominator,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use a decimal point to separate the numerator and denominator of a fraction, rather than using a horizontal line or a slash to indicate division. For example, they might write 3.4 instead of 3/4. This shows a misunderstanding of the notation used to represent fractions and can lead to confusion when working with fractions in various mathematical contexts.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to write a fraction in its simplest form and they use a decimal point instead of a slash, e.g., 1.2 instead of 1/2.
- When students are adding or subtracting fractions and they incorrectly use decimal points, e.g., 1.4 + 1.2 instead of 1/4 + 1/2.
- When students are converting mixed numbers to improper fractions and they mistakenly use a decimal point, e.g., 2.3 instead of 2 3/1 or 7/3.
- When students are solving problems involving equivalent ratios and they incorrectly use decimal points, e.g., 2.5 instead of 2/5."
1638,Counts repeated factors as two separate factors,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify or count the factors of a given number, but they incorrectly count repeated factors as separate factors. For example, when finding the factors of 12, students may list 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, and 12, and then count each of these as separate factors, resulting in an incorrect total count. This shows a lack of understanding of what constitutes a distinct factor and how repeated factors should be handled.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When finding the total number of factors of a number, such as finding the factors of 24.
- When identifying factors to simplify fractions or algebraic expressions, such as simplifying the fraction 12/16.
- When comparing the number of factors of different numbers, such as comparing the factors of 12 and 18."
1639,Believes adding two negatives gives a positive answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of negative numbers. They may think that since two negative emotions or situations are ""bad,"" combining them should result in something ""good"" or positive. This incorrect understanding can lead them to believe that adding two negative numbers will yield a positive result. For instance, they might think -3 + (-4) equals 7, instead of the correct answer, -7.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving simple arithmetic problems involving negative numbers, such as -2 + (-5) or -1 + (-3).
- When working with number lines, students might incorrectly assume that moving left (representing negative numbers) twice will result in moving right (representing positive numbers).
- When dealing with real-world problems that involve temperatures, debts, or other scenarios where negative numbers are used, students may mistakenly apply the incorrect rule to obtain an answer."
1640,Believes the centre of rotation is always the origin,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that whenever an object is rotated, the centre of rotation is always at the origin (0, 0) of the coordinate system. The students may believe that rotation can only occur around the origin and may not consider other points as potential centres of rotation. They might struggle to visualize or understand rotations around other points, which can lead to difficulties in various geometric transformations, such as rotations in the coordinate plane.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When students are asked to rotate a shape by 90 degrees in the coordinate plane, they might assume the rotation is around the origin, even if the problem doesn't specify the centre of rotation.
- Case 2: In problems involving multiple transformations (e.g., rotation, translation, reflection), students may incorrectly assume that the centre of rotation is the origin, even if the problem states otherwise.
- Case 3: When dealing with real-world applications, such as rotations in design or architecture, students may struggle to identify the centre of rotation if it is not at the origin, leading to incorrect calculations or designs.
- Case 4: In graphing and charting, students may have trouble rotating graphs or charts around a point other than the origin, which can lead to incorrect representations of the data."
1641,"When collecting like terms, only simplifies when there is an addition","Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that collecting like terms only applies to addition operations. They might think that when there is a subtraction or a combination of addition and subtraction operations, the terms cannot be simplified. This can lead to incorrect simplification of algebraic expressions. 

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying an expression like 3x - 2x, students might not combine the like terms because they are subtracting, resulting in an incorrect answer of 3x - 2x instead of x.
- When simplifying an expression like 5x + 2x - x, students might only combine the terms with the addition operation (5x + 2x) but not subtract x from the result, resulting in an incorrect answer of 7x - x instead of 6x.
- When simplifying an expression like 2x - x + 3x, students might only combine the terms with the addition operation (3x + 2x) but not subtract x from the result before adding, resulting in an incorrect answer of 5x - x instead of 4x."
1642,"When adding roots, adds the numbers under the roots","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with the addition of radical expressions, specifically when adding square roots. They mistakenly believe that adding the numbers under the radical sign (or the radicands) is the correct way to add the roots. For example, when adding √a and √b, they might think the result is √(a + b). This shows a lack of understanding of the properties of radicals and how they interact with basic arithmetic operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When adding two simple square roots, such as √4 and √9, the student might answer √(4 + 9) = √13 instead of recognizing that the roots cannot be directly added.
* When dealing with expressions like √2 + √3, the student might attempt to simplify it to √(2 + 3) = √5, again showing the same misunderstanding.
* In problems that involve adding radicals with the same index but different radicands, such as 2√3 + 3√4, the student might incorrectly add the radicands together as if they were like terms."
1643,"Believes that when increasing by a percentage over 100, they do not need to add an extra 1 to the decimal multiplier for the original amount","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating percentage increases greater than 100%. They may understand that to find a percentage increase, they need to convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply the original amount by that decimal. However, when the percentage increase is over 100%, they may forget or misunderstand that they need to add 1 to the decimal multiplier to account for the original amount.

For example, if the original amount is 50 and it increases by 150%, students with this misconception may multiply 50 by 1.5 (150% as a decimal) to get 75, instead of multiplying 50 by 2.5 (1 + 1.5).

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* A shirt is originally priced at $20, and its price increases by 120%. Students may calculate the new price as $20 x 1.2 = $24, instead of $20 x 2.2 = $44.
* A bakery is having a sale where they increase the number of free cookies with every purchase by 200%. If a customer originally gets 2 free cookies, students may calculate the new number of free cookies as 2 x 2 = 4, instead of 2 x 3 = 6.
* A water tank can hold 1000 liters of water, and its capacity is increased by 180%. Students may calculate the new capacity as 1000 x 1.8 = 1800 liters, instead of 1000 x 2.8 = 2800 liters."
1644,Confuses collecting like terms with multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of collecting like terms in algebraic expressions. They tend to think that when combining like terms, they are multiplying the terms instead of adding or subtracting their coefficients. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the distributive property and the concept of like terms. Students may think that the numbers or variables in an expression are being multiplied together, rather than recognizing that they are being added or subtracted.

For example, when simplifying expressions like:

* 2x + 3x (students may think the answer is 2x * 3x = 6x^2 instead of 5x)
* 4y - 2y (students may think the answer is 4y * -2y = -8y^2 instead of 2y)
* x + 2x + 3x (students may think the answer is x * 2x * 3x = 6x^3 instead of 6x)

This misconception can also occur when working with algebraic equations, such as:

* 2x + 2x = 4 (students may think the equation becomes 2x * 2x = 4x^2 instead of 4x = 4)
* x + 3x = 5 (students may think the equation becomes x * 3x = 3x^2 instead of 4x = 5)

This misconception can hinder students' ability to simplify expressions, solve equations, and understand more advanced algebraic concepts."
1645,Thinks there are 10ml in a litre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of the conversion between milliliters (mL) and liters (L). They may think that there are only 10 milliliters in a liter, rather than the correct conversion of 1 liter being equal to 1000 milliliters. This error can lead to incorrect calculations and measurements in various mathematical and real-world applications.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to convert 500 mL to liters, the student may answer 50 liters instead of 0.5 liters.
- When a recipe calls for 2 liters of water, the student may think they need 20 mL instead of 2000 mL.
- When solving a problem that involves measuring the capacity of a container in liters, the student may incorrectly calculate the volume in milliliters.
- When comparing the capacity of different containers, the student may think that a 100 mL container is 1/10 of a liter instead of 1/10 of a tenth of a liter."
1646,"In ratio question where one side of ratio is given, uses that as one part in ratio without dividing","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a ratio problem where one side of the ratio is provided, but they fail to understand that the given value represents the total amount for that part, not one unit of the ratio. As a result, they incorrectly use the given value as one part of the ratio without dividing it by the corresponding number of parts.

For example, in a problem where a recipe requires a ratio of 2:3 of sugar to flour, and 6 cups of sugar are given, students with this misconception might assume that the 6 cups of sugar represent one part of the ratio, rather than dividing the 6 cups by 2 to find the value of one part.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Sharing a certain amount of money or objects in a given ratio, where students might not divide the given amount by the corresponding number of parts.
- Scaling up or down a recipe that involves ratios, where students might not adjust the quantities correctly.
- Solving problems involving equivalent ratios, where students might not understand that the given value represents a multiple of the ratio, rather than one part of it."
1647,Believes that numbers are read aloud digit by digit ,"Explanation: This misconception involves students believing that when reading numbers aloud, each digit should be read individually, rather than understanding the concept of place value and how numbers are typically read in groups. For example, the number 456 would be read as ""four, five, six"" instead of ""four hundred and fifty-six."" This demonstrates a lack of understanding of how numbers are structured and the relationships between digits in different place value positions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When reading large numbers, such as 1,234, where the student might read it as ""one, two, three, four"" instead of ""one thousand, two hundred and thirty-four.""
- When dealing with money, such as £45.67, where the student might read it as ""four, five, six, seven"" instead of ""forty-five pounds and sixty-seven pence.""
- When reading numbers in real-life contexts, such as addresses (e.g., 145 Main Street) or phone numbers (e.g., 01234 567890), where the student might read each digit individually instead of in groups."
1648,Believes dividing two positives will give a negative answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the rules of division, especially when it comes to positive numbers. They may incorrectly assume that dividing two positive numbers will result in a negative answer, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the concept of division as sharing or grouping. This misconception can also be caused by a misunderstanding of the rules of signs in mathematics, where students might incorrectly apply the rule that a negative times a negative equals a positive, but fail to understand that a positive divided by a positive also equals a positive.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A student is given the problem 12 ÷ 4 and answers -3.
- A student is asked to solve the equation 8 ÷ 2 and responds with -4.
- A student is presented with a word problem, ""If Sally has 18 cookies and she wants to put them in boxes of 3 cookies each, how many boxes can she make?"" and answers -6 boxes.
- A student is given the problem 24 ÷ 6 and answers -4.
- A student is asked to solve the equation 9 ÷ 3 and responds with -3."
1649,Believes that all recurring decimals can be converted to a fraction by writing the digits of the decimal over 9,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students learn that some recurring decimals, such as 0.333... or 0.999..., can be converted to fractions by writing the repeating digit(s) over 9. For example, 0.333... can be expressed as 3/9 or 1/3. However, students may incorrectly generalize this rule to all recurring decimals, assuming that simply writing the repeating digits over 9 will always yield the correct fraction.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When the recurring decimal has multiple repeating digits, such as 0.142857142857...
- When the recurring decimal has a non-repeating part before the repeating part, such as 0.412121...
- When the recurring decimal has a more complex repeating pattern, such as 0.123456123456...
- When the recurring decimal is a result of a division operation, such as 22/7 = 3.142857142857..."
1650,Only includes full hours when measuring time in minutes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert hours into minutes or calculate time intervals. They tend to overlook or ignore the partial hours and only consider the full hours. For instance, when calculating the total minutes from 9:45 AM to 11:15 AM, students might subtract 9 hours from 11 hours, getting 2 hours, and then multiply it by 60 to get 120 minutes. However, they neglect the 30 minutes (15 minutes from 9:45 to 10:00 and 15 minutes from 11:00 to 11:15) that are not part of the full hours.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:
- Converting mixed hours and minutes to just minutes (e.g., 3 hours 30 minutes to minutes)
- Calculating elapsed time when the start or end time is not on the hour (e.g., 10:30 AM to 12:45 PM)
- Solving word problems involving time intervals (e.g., a movie starts at 2:15 PM and lasts 2 hours 45 minutes, what time does it end?)
- Comparing time intervals that include partial hours (e.g., which is longer: 2 hours 30 minutes or 2 hours 45 minutes)"
1651,Multiplies when converting to a larger unit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when converting a measurement from a smaller unit to a larger unit, they need to multiply the value. For example, when converting 1000 grams to kilograms, students with this misconception may think that the conversion involves multiplying 1000 by a certain factor, rather than dividing it.

This misconception can be seen in the following cases:

- Converting 1000 meters to kilometers: A student with this misconception may multiply 1000 by a factor, instead of dividing it by 1000 to get the correct answer of 1 kilometer.
- Converting 500 grams to kilograms: The student may multiply 500 by a factor, instead of dividing it by 1000 to get the correct answer of 0.5 kilograms.
- Converting 2500 milliliters to liters: The student may multiply 2500 by a factor, instead of dividing it by 1000 to get the correct answer of 2.5 liters."
1652,Thinks there are 100mm in a centimetre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 100 millimeters (mm) in a centimeter (cm). This is likely due to the fact that there are 100 centimeters in a meter, and students may mistakenly apply this conversion to millimeters and centimeters. In reality, there are actually 10 millimeters in a centimeter.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting measurements from millimeters to centimeters, students may incorrectly divide by 100 instead of 10.
- When solving problems involving mixed units of measurement, students may incorrectly assume that 100 mm is equal to 1 cm.
- When comparing measurements in different units, students may mistakenly think that 100 mm is longer than 1 cm.
- When working with real-world applications, such as measuring the length of objects or calculating the perimeter of shapes, students may apply this incorrect conversion, leading to inaccurate results."
1653,Misunderstands how to adjust proportions for different sample sizes in stratified sampling,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with stratified sampling in Data and Statistics. They may understand the concept of stratified sampling, where a population is divided into distinct subgroups or strata, and a sample is taken from each stratum. However, they may struggle to adjust the proportions of the sample for different sample sizes.

In particular, students may mistakenly believe that the proportion of the sample in each stratum should remain constant, regardless of the overall sample size. They may fail to recognize that as the sample size changes, the number of samples in each stratum should also change to maintain the same proportion.

For example, if a student is taking a sample of 100 people from a population of 1000, with 60% from stratum A and 40% from stratum B, they may correctly calculate that they need 60 people from stratum A and 40 people from stratum B. However, if they are then asked to take a sample of 500 people from the same population, they may incorrectly assume that they still need 60 people from stratum A and 40 people from stratum B, rather than scaling up the numbers to maintain the same proportions.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions, and can have serious implications in real-world applications where accurate sampling is crucial.

Some short cases where this misconception will occur:

- A student is conducting a survey of students in a school and wants to ensure that the sample is representative of the different year groups. They calculate the proportions of students in each year group, but fail to adjust these proportions when the sample size is increased or decreased.
- A researcher is conducting a study on the behavior of a particular species and wants to take a stratified sample of the population. They divide the population into different strata based on age, sex, and other factors, but fail to adjust the proportions of the sample in each stratum when the sample size is changed.
- A market researcher is conducting a survey of customers and wants to ensure that the sample is representative of the different demographics. They calculate the proportions of customers in each demographic, but fail to adjust these proportions when the sample size is increased or decreased."
1654,Believes y=f(-x) is a reflection in y=-x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that reflecting a function f(x) across the line y = -x will result in the function y = f(-x). However, reflecting a function f(x) across the line y = x will actually result in the function y = f^(-1)(x), which is the inverse function, whereas reflecting a function f(x) across the y-axis will result in y = f(-x). The line y = -x is actually the line where a function's reflection would occur to create its negative reciprocal or a 90-degree rotation followed by a reflection across the y-axis, not a simple reflection of the original function across y = -x.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When graphing functions and their reflections or transformations.
- When determining the equation of a reflected function.
- When analyzing the symmetry of a graph in relation to the lines y = x and y = -x."
1655,"When adding fractions, changes to common denominator but leaves numerators the same","Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the need to have a common denominator when adding fractions but mistakenly believe that only the denominators need to be adjusted, while the numerators can remain unchanged. They may incorrectly assume that the process of finding a common denominator automatically makes the fractions equivalent and ready for addition, without realizing that the numerators must also be adjusted proportionally to maintain the original fraction's value.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When adding fractions with different denominators, such as 1/4 + 1/6, students might change both denominators to 12 but incorrectly write the sum as 1/12 + 1/12, instead of finding the correct equivalent fractions (3/12 + 2/12).
- In word problems involving the addition of fractional parts, like combining 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/3 cup of sugar, students might convert both fractions to have a common denominator of 6 but incorrectly add them as 1/6 + 1/6, instead of converting to equivalent fractions (3/6 + 2/6).
- When solving mixed-number addition problems, such as 2 1/4 + 1 1/6, students might correctly find the common denominator but then fail to adjust the numerators, leading to an incorrect calculation."
1656,Believes that one point is enough to specify a line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a single point on a coordinate plane is sufficient to define a line. They may think that as long as they have one point, they can draw a line through it, without realizing that an infinite number of lines can actually pass through that single point. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental concept in geometry that a line is typically defined by two distinct points. 

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to graph a line given a single point and they assume that the line can only pass through that point.
- When students are given a point on a line and asked to write the equation of the line, and they fail to recognize that there are multiple lines that can pass through that point.
- When students are working on a problem that involves finding the equation of a line that passes through a given point, and they incorrectly assume that the line is unique."
1657,Doubles the diameter when finding the radius,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the radius of a circle, they need to double the diameter, rather than halve it. This misunderstanding arises from the relationship between the diameter and the radius, where the diameter is twice the length of the radius. Students may get confused and think that to find the radius, they need to multiply the diameter by 2, instead of dividing it by 2.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A circle has a diameter of 10 cm, and the student thinks the radius is 20 cm.
- A bicycle wheel has a diameter of 60 cm, and the student calculates the radius to be 120 cm.
- A circular table has a diameter of 2 meters, and the student believes the radius is 4 meters."
1658,Does not link Pythagoras Theorem to finding distance between two points,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students view Pythagoras Theorem as a formula only applicable to finding the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle, but fail to recognize its broader application in calculating the distance between two points in a coordinate plane. They may see Pythagoras Theorem as a standalone concept, rather than a fundamental principle that can be used to solve problems involving distance and spatial relationships.

This misconception may arise because students are often introduced to Pythagoras Theorem in the context of simple geometric problems, such as finding the length of a shadow or the height of a building, without being shown its connection to coordinate geometry.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When students are given two points on a coordinate grid and asked to find the distance between them, they may not think to use Pythagoras Theorem, instead trying to use other methods such as counting squares or using a ruler.
- When solving problems involving the distance between two points in a real-world context, such as the distance between two cities or the length of a journey, students may not recognize that Pythagoras Theorem can be used to find the distance.
- When working with graphs and charts, students may struggle to find the distance between two points on a curve or a line, because they do not understand how to apply Pythagoras Theorem in this context."
1659,Finds one part of a ratio but doesn't multiply that by the number of parts needed,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding one part of a ratio, but fail to realize that they need to multiply that part by the required number of parts to find the total amount. 

For example, in a recipe, if the ratio of flour to sugar is 3:2 and a student is asked to find the amount of flour needed for 4 parts, they might find the amount for 1 part (3 units) but forget to multiply it by the required number of parts (4), resulting in an incorrect answer of just 3 units instead of 12 units (3 x 4).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A paint recipe requires a ratio of 2:3 of blue to red paint. If 6 parts are needed, a student might find the amount of blue paint for 1 part (2 units) but not multiply it by 6.
- A music festival has a ratio of 5:2 of adults to children attending. If 7 parts are needed, a student might find the number of adults for 1 part (5 people) but not multiply it by 7.
- A farmer is planting a garden with a ratio of 3:4 of flowers to vegetables. If 9 parts are needed, a student might find the number of flowers for 1 part (3 plants) but not multiply it by 9."
1660,"When using inequality notation, thinks ""greater than/less than or equal to"" symbols are instead the ""greater than/less than"" symbols and vice versa","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly swap the meaning of the inequality symbols. They may think that the ""greater than or equal to"" symbol (≥) means ""greater than"" and the ""greater than"" symbol (>) means ""greater than or equal to"". Similarly, they may confuse the ""less than or equal to"" symbol (≤) with ""less than"" (<) and vice versa.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When solving linear inequalities, students may write the solution as x > 5 when the correct solution is x ≥ 5.
- When graphing inequalities on a number line, students may use an open circle for ""greater than or equal to"" and a closed circle for ""greater than"".
- When working with compound inequalities, students may incorrectly use the symbols, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When solving real-world problems involving inequalities, such as ""Tom has more than $100"" and mistakenly writing it as x ≥ 100 instead of x > 100.
- When comparing numbers, students may say 5 is greater than or equal to 5, but write it as 5 > 5 instead of 5 ≥ 5."
1661,Confuses circumference and diameter,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly interchange the definitions and formulas of circumference and diameter. They may incorrectly believe that the diameter is the distance around a circle (which is actually the circumference), or that the circumference is the distance across a circle passing through its center (which is actually the diameter). This confusion can lead to incorrect calculations and misunderstandings in problems involving circles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to calculate the circumference of a circle, a student might use the formula for diameter (d = 2r) instead of the formula for circumference (C = 2πr or C = πd).
- When given the diameter of a circle and asked to find the distance around it, a student might simply state the diameter as the answer, forgetting to multiply it by π to get the circumference.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring the distance around a circular table or the perimeter of a circular garden, students might use the diameter instead of the circumference, leading to incorrect measurements."
1662,Does not know the y intercept is where the x coordinate is 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify the y-intercept of a line on a graph. They may not understand that the y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis, and that this point always has an x-coordinate of 0. As a result, they may incorrectly identify the y-intercept or struggle to find it altogether.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When graphing a linear equation and being asked to identify the y-intercept.
- When analyzing the equation of a line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b) and being unable to recognize that the value of b represents the y-intercept.
- When solving systems of linear equations and needing to find the point of intersection, which may involve identifying the y-intercept of one or both lines.
- When working with quadratic equations and being asked to identify the y-intercept of the parabola.
- When analyzing real-world data and needing to interpret the y-intercept in the context of the problem, such as the initial value of a quantity being measured."
1663,Thinks halving is the same as multiplying by 2,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of halving and its relationship with multiplication. They may believe that halving a number is equivalent to multiplying it by 2, rather than dividing it by 2. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the inverse relationship between multiplication and division or a misunderstanding of the concept of halving as a division operation.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. If a pizza has 16 slices and a student is asked to halve it, they may think that there will be 32 slices (16 x 2) instead of 8 slices (16 ÷ 2).
2. When sharing a bag of 12 candies equally between two people, a student with this misconception may think each person gets 24 candies (12 x 2) instead of 6 candies (12 ÷ 2).
3. In a recipe that requires halving the amount of sugar from 4 cups, a student may mistakenly use 8 cups (4 x 2) instead of 2 cups (4 ÷ 2)."
1664,Mixes up squaring and halving,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap or confuse the mathematical operations of squaring (raising a number to the power of 2) and halving (dividing a number by 2). This can lead to incorrect calculations and solutions, particularly in algebraic expressions and numerical problems. Students may incorrectly apply the properties of squaring and halving, thinking that squaring a number means dividing it by 2, or that halving a number means multiplying it by itself.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When solving equations, such as 2x = 8, students might divide both sides by 2, but then incorrectly square the result, thinking that x = (8/2)^2.
2. When working with exponents, students might see the expression 2^2 and incorrectly simplify it to 2/2 = 1.
3. In numerical problems, students might be asked to find the area of a square with a side length of 4cm. They might incorrectly halve the side length instead of squaring it, thinking that the area is 4/2 = 2 square cm.
4. When working with fractions, students might see the expression (1/2)^2 and incorrectly simplify it to 1/4 = 1/2 divided by 2."
1665,Believes when frequencies multiply by a scale factor in a table the median also multiplies by that scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that when the frequencies in a table are multiplied by a scale factor, the median will also be multiplied by the same scale factor. They may think that since the frequencies are being scaled up or down, the median, which is a measure of central tendency, will also be affected in the same way. 

This misconception may occur when:

- A student is given a table with a set of data and is asked to find the median, then later given the same table but with the frequencies multiplied by a scale factor and is asked to find the new median.
- A student is working with a dataset that has multiple categories with different frequencies, and they are asked to find the median after scaling up or down the frequencies.
- A student is comparing the medians of two datasets, one with original frequencies and the other with scaled frequencies, and they assume the medians will have the same scale factor relationship."
1666,"When factorising into single brackets, factorises the first term correctly but subtracts the number outside the bracket with the second term in the expression to find the second term in the bracket","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are attempting to factorise an algebraic expression into single brackets, but incorrectly apply the process. They may correctly identify the greatest common factor (GCF) of the terms and place it outside the bracket, but then mistakenly subtract the number outside the bracket from the second term in the expression, rather than dividing or finding the correct term to complete the factorisation.

For example, when factorising the expression 6x + 12, a student with this misconception may correctly identify 6 as the GCF and write 6(x + ?), but then incorrectly subtract 6 from 12 to get 6, resulting in the incorrect factorisation 6(x + 6).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising 4x + 8, the student may write 4(x + 4) instead of 4(x + 2).
- Factorising 3x + 9, the student may write 3(x + 6) instead of 3(x + 3).
- Factorising 2x + 6, the student may write 2(x + 4) instead of 2(x + 3)."
1667,When comparing unit fractions believes that fractions with larger denominators are greater in size.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to fractions and they tend to focus on the size of the denominator rather than the relationship between the numerator and the denominator. They believe that a larger denominator automatically means a larger fraction, regardless of the numerator. For example, they might think that 1/8 is greater than 1/4 because 8 is greater than 4.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two unit fractions, such as 1/4 and 1/6, students might say that 1/6 is greater because 6 is greater than 4.
- When ordering a set of unit fractions, such as 1/2, 1/3, and 1/5, students might arrange them in the order 1/5, 1/3, 1/2, because they are focusing on the size of the denominators.
- When solving problems that involve comparing fractions, such as determining which is greater, 1/4 or 1/8, students might choose the fraction with the larger denominator."
1668,Calculates area when asked for perimeter,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly calculate the area of a shape instead of its perimeter. The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape, while the area is the amount of space inside the shape. Students may get confused between these two concepts, especially if they are not clear about the definitions and formulas for each. They might use the formula for the area (e.g., length x width) when asked to find the perimeter, which requires adding up the lengths of all the sides.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When asked to find the perimeter of a rectangle, a student might multiply the length and width instead of adding the lengths of all four sides.
- When given a real-world problem, such as finding the amount of fencing needed to surround a garden, a student might calculate the area of the garden instead of its perimeter.
- When working with shapes that have equal side lengths, such as squares, students might assume that the area and perimeter are the same or confuse the formulas for each.
- When dealing with more complex shapes, such as triangles or polygons, students might get confused about which formula to use and end up calculating the area instead of the perimeter."
1669,"In 3 letter angle notation, gives a wider angle that contains the shaded angle","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify or notate angles using the 3-letter angle notation. In this notation, an angle is denoted by three letters, where the middle letter is the vertex of the angle, and the other two letters represent the two arms or sides of the angle. The misconception is that the students think the 3-letter angle notation always refers to the larger or wider angle that contains the shaded angle, rather than the specific angle formed by the two arms.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a diagram shows two or more angles sharing the same vertex, and students are asked to identify a specific angle using the 3-letter notation.
- In problems involving angle addition or subtraction, where students need to identify and notate specific angles.
- When students are given a complex diagram with multiple angles and are asked to identify and label each angle using the 3-letter notation.
- In situations where students are asked to find the measure of an angle, and they mistakenly identify the angle as the larger or wider angle that contains the shaded angle."
1670,Does not realise that multiplication can be broken down into factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students view multiplication as a fixed operation that cannot be altered or broken down into simpler components. They may think that multiplication is only about memorizing multiplication tables and applying them rigidly. As a result, they may struggle to see that a multiplication problem can be broken down into smaller factors, making the calculation easier and more manageable.

For example, when faced with a multiplication problem like 12 x 15, students with this misconception may only try to memorize the multiplication table for 12 and 15, rather than breaking it down into simpler factors like (4 x 3) x (5 x 3) or 4 x 5 x 3 x 3.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When multiplying two large numbers, such as 24 x 18, and not realizing that it can be broken down into (4 x 6) x (3 x 6).
- When solving real-world problems that involve multiplication, such as calculating the area of a room that is 12 meters long and 8 meters wide, and not breaking it down into simpler factors.
- When dealing with word problems that involve multiplication, such as ""Tom has 4 groups of 6 pencils each, and each group is further divided into 3 smaller groups. How many pencils does Tom have in total?"" and not realizing that the problem can be broken down into smaller factors."
1671,Does not know how to find area by counting squares on a grid,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a shape by counting squares on a grid, but they are unsure about how to do so. They may count the squares incorrectly, such as counting the same square multiple times, missing some squares, or not accounting for fractions of a square. They may also struggle to identify the correct unit of measurement, such as confusing square units with linear units.

This misconception can occur in various cases, including:

* When finding the area of a rectangle or square with sides that are not aligned with the grid lines.
* When finding the area of a shape with curved or irregular boundaries, making it difficult to count the squares accurately.
* When the shape extends beyond the grid, requiring students to extend the grid or estimate the area.
* When the grid is not square, but rather rectangular, making it harder to count squares.
* When the shape is composed of multiple parts, requiring students to find the area of each part separately and add them up.
* When students are asked to find the area of a shape in real-world contexts, such as finding the area of a room or a garden, and they need to apply their understanding of counting squares to solve the problem."
1672,"Confuses the order of operations, believes addition comes before multiplication ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully familiar with the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). They incorrectly assume that operations should be performed from left to right, or that addition is inherently more important than multiplication. As a result, when faced with expressions involving both addition and multiplication, they will perform the addition operation first.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- 3 + 4 × 5: The student may calculate 3 + 4 = 7, then multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, rather than multiplying 4 by 5 first to get 20, then adding 3 to get 23.
- 2 + 3 × 2 + 1: The student may add 2 and 3 first to get 5, then multiply 5 by 2 to get 10, and finally add 1 to get 11, rather than following the correct order of operations.
- 10 + 2 × 3 - 4: The student may perform the addition and subtraction from left to right, resulting in an incorrect calculation."
1673,Multiplied by 1000 instead of 100,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are converting between units, such as grams to kilograms or milliliters to liters, and mistakenly multiply or divide by 1000 instead of 100. This error often stems from a lack of understanding of the relationships between different units and the conversion factors required to switch between them.

For example, when converting 2500 grams to kilograms, a student with this misconception may multiply 2500 by 1000 instead of dividing by 1000, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2500000 kilograms instead of 2.5 kilograms.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 450 grams to kilograms: Student multiplies 450 by 1000 instead of dividing by 1000.
- Converting 750 milliliters to liters: Student multiplies 750 by 1000 instead of dividing by 1000.
- Converting 0.5 kilograms to grams: Student multiplies 0.5 by 100 instead of multiplying by 1000."
1674,Believes distance is the area under the graph on a displacement time graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the concept of finding the area under a graph, which is typically used to calculate the displacement or work done in a force-displacement graph, to a displacement-time graph. They incorrectly assume that the area under the graph in a displacement-time graph represents the distance traveled. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing the motion of an object and interpreting the area under the displacement-time graph as the total distance traveled, rather than recognizing it as a representation of the displacement over time.
- When comparing the motion of two objects and incorrectly concluding that the object with the greater area under its displacement-time graph has traveled a greater distance.
- When solving problems involving the calculation of distance traveled and mistakenly using the area under the displacement-time graph as the solution, rather than finding the total distance by summing the absolute values of the individual displacements."
1675,Changes wrong place value column when rounding,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly identify the place value column they need to round to. For example, if asked to round a number to the nearest ten, they might change the digit in the ones column instead of the tens column, or if asked to round to the nearest hundred, they might change the digit in the tens column instead of the hundreds column. This misconception can lead to incorrect rounding and shows a lack of understanding of place value.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Rounding 456 to the nearest ten, a student might change the 6 (ones column) instead of the 5 (tens column).
- Rounding 982 to the nearest hundred, a student might change the 8 (tens column) instead of the 9 (hundreds column).
- Rounding 1157 to the nearest thousand, a student might change the 1 (hundreds column) instead of the 1 (thousands column)."
1676,"When adding or subtracting surds, does not simplify the surd before adding the numbers in front of the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. When adding or subtracting surds, students may not realize the importance of simplifying the surd before combining the numbers in front of it. They might simply add or subtract the numbers in front of the surd without checking if the surds themselves can be simplified. This can lead to incorrect answers and a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When adding 2√8 and 3√8, students might write the answer as 5√8 without simplifying the surd, instead of simplifying √8 to 2√2 and then adding to get 5(2√2) = 10√2.
* When subtracting 4√12 from 6√12, students might write the answer as 2√12 without simplifying the surd, instead of simplifying √12 to 2√3 and then subtracting to get 2(2√3) = 4√3.
* When adding √18 and 2√18, students might write the answer as 3√18 without simplifying the surd, instead of simplifying √18 to 3√2 and then adding to get 3(3√2) = 9√2."
1677,"Thinks the range is just the first value subtracted from the last value, without ordering","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the range of a set of data and they simply subtract the first value from the last value, without considering whether the first value is the smallest and the last value is the largest. They may not realize that the range is actually the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset, regardless of their position in the list.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When the data is not arranged in order, and the first value is not the smallest or the last value is not the largest. For example, the dataset {8, 2, 9, 1, 7} - a student with this misconception would calculate the range as 7 (9 - 2), instead of 8 (9 - 1).
- When the dataset contains negative numbers or zero, and the student doesn't consider the impact of these values on the range. For example, the dataset {-5, 0, 3, 10} - a student with this misconception would calculate the range as 7 (10 - 3), instead of 15 (10 - (-5)).
- When the dataset has multiple maximum or minimum values, and the student only considers the first or last value. For example, the dataset {5, 5, 5, 1, 9, 9, 9} - a student with this misconception would calculate the range as 4 (9 - 5), which is correct in this case but only coincidentally."
1678,Confuses perimeter and area,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly interchange the concepts of perimeter and area. Perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape, while area is the amount of space inside the shape. Students with this misconception may incorrectly apply formulas, thinking that the perimeter formula (e.g., P = 2l + 2w for a rectangle) calculates the area, or vice versa (e.g., A = l × w for a rectangle calculates the perimeter).

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When calculating the cost of fencing a garden, a student might use the area formula instead of the perimeter formula to determine the amount of fencing needed.
* When comparing the sizes of two rooms, a student might think that a room with a larger perimeter has a larger area, without considering the actual dimensions.
* When solving problems involving scale drawings, a student might mistakenly scale the perimeter of a shape instead of the area, or vice versa.
* When calculating the amount of material needed to cover a surface, a student might confuse the perimeter and area, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When determining the size of a rug that can fit in a room, a student might use the perimeter of the room instead of the area to make the calculation."
1679,Uses addition instead of the associative property of multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the rules of addition to multiplication problems, particularly when dealing with the associative property. In multiplication, the associative property allows us to regroup numbers in different ways without changing the result, e.g., (2 × 3) × 4 = 2 × (3 × 4). However, students with this misconception might incorrectly apply the rules of addition and think that the associative property of multiplication works in a similar way to addition, where the order of the numbers doesn't matter but the operation is different.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to calculate (3 × 4) × 5 and instead calculates 3 × (4 + 5).
- When asked to simplify (2 × 3) × 4, a student incorrectly calculates 2 + (3 × 4).
- A student incorrectly rewrites (5 × 2) × 3 as 5 + (2 × 3).
- When asked to calculate 4 × (3 × 2), a student mistakenly calculates (4 + 3) × 2."
1680,Does not realize we can omit the multiplication symbol in algebraic expressions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are first introduced to algebraic expressions and are used to seeing multiplication represented by a symbol (e.g. 2 × x) in arithmetic. They may not understand that in algebra, the multiplication symbol is often omitted for simplicity and convention (e.g. 2x). As a result, they may become confused when they encounter expressions without the explicit multiplication symbol and struggle to interpret or write expressions correctly.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying expressions, e.g. writing 2 × x + 3 × x as 2x + 3x
- When solving equations, e.g. 2 × x = 6 written as 2x = 6
- When multiplying variables, e.g. x × y written as xy
- When expanding expressions, e.g. 2 × (x + 3) written as 2(x + 3) and then expanded as 2x + 6."
1681,Assumes grouped data is evenly distributed within each group,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the data within each group or interval in a grouped data set is uniformly distributed, meaning they assume that the data points are evenly spaced and that each value within the group has an equal frequency or probability. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as the actual distribution of data within each group can be skewed, symmetrical, or follow any other pattern.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly estimate or calculate various statistical measures such as the mean, median, or mode, and make inaccurate conclusions about the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Calculating the mean of grouped data by using the midpoint of each group as the representative value, without considering the actual distribution of data within each group.
- Estimating the median of grouped data by assuming that it lies at the midpoint of the median group, without considering the actual distribution of data within that group.
- Drawing conclusions about the shape of the data distribution based solely on the group frequencies, without considering the actual distribution of data within each group.
- Using histograms or other graphical representations to make inferences about the data, without considering the limitations and potential biases of grouped data."
1682,Confuses inequality symbols with equality,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use equality symbols (=) in place of inequality symbols (>, <, ≥, ≤) or vice versa. They may interpret statements involving inequalities as if they were equalities, or believe that inequalities can be manipulated in the same way as equalities. For instance, they may think that if two expressions are not equal but have a relationship (e.g., one is greater than the other), an equality symbol should still be used.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- When comparing the lengths of two line segments, a student might write ""AB = CD"" even though AB is longer than CD.
- In solving an inequality problem like 3x > 6, a student may divide both sides by 3 and write the solution as x = 2, rather than x > 2.
- When working with word problems, a student might write an equation to represent a situation that involves ""more than"" or ""less than,"" but use an equality symbol instead of an inequality symbol.
- When graphing inequalities on a number line, a student may use a closed circle for an open inequality or vice versa, indicating confusion about the difference between ""equal to"" and ""not equal to.""
- In algebra, a student may incorrectly apply operations to an inequality, such as adding or subtracting the same value to both sides of an inequality without considering the direction of the inequality."
1683,Thinks the length of the hypotenuse is the sum of the two shorter sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. They may believe that the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is simply the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. This error may be due to a lack of understanding of the Pythagorean theorem, which actually states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with legs of length 3 and 4, they may answer 7 (3 + 4) instead of the correct answer.
- When students are given a right-angled triangle with one leg of length 5 and the hypotenuse of length 10, they may believe the other leg has a length of 5 (10 - 5) instead of using the Pythagorean theorem to find the correct length.
- When students are solving problems involving right-angled triangles in real-world contexts, such as building design or physics, they may make incorrect calculations and arrive at incorrect conclusions due to this misconception."
1684,"When finding the difference between two marks on a scale, counts lines instead of gaps","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are reading scales, such as number lines, rulers, or measuring tapes, and they mistakenly count the lines (or marks) instead of the gaps between the lines to find the difference between two points. This means that they are counting the individual marks or lines rather than the units or intervals between them, leading to an incorrect calculation of the difference.

For example, if a student is using a ruler to measure the difference between 3cm and 6cm, they might count the lines at 3cm, 4cm, 5cm, and 6cm, and conclude that the difference is 4 units (because they counted 4 lines), instead of counting the gaps between the lines, which would give them the correct answer of 3 units (3 gaps: 3-4, 4-5, and 5-6).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is using a number line to find the difference between 5 and 9, and they count the lines at 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, getting an incorrect answer of 5 units.
* A student is measuring the length of an object using a ruler and counts the lines instead of the gaps, resulting in an incorrect measurement.
* A student is reading a measuring tape to find the difference between two points, and they count the lines instead of the gaps, leading to an incorrect calculation."
1685,Confuses angle of a sector with the diameter,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the angle of a sector is related to or equal to its diameter. They may think that a larger diameter corresponds to a larger angle, or vice versa. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when dealing with sectors, especially in problems involving arc lengths, sector areas, and central angles.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- When finding the area of a sector, a student might incorrectly assume that a sector with a larger diameter will always have a larger area, regardless of the angle.
- When calculating the length of an arc, a student might mistakenly use the diameter instead of the radius and angle to find the arc length.
- When comparing two sectors, a student might incorrectly conclude that the sector with the larger diameter has the larger angle, without considering the actual angle measurements.
- When solving problems involving circular motion, such as the rotation of a wheel or a gear, students might confuse the diameter of the circle with the angle of rotation, leading to incorrect calculations of distance traveled or velocity."
1686,Confuses diameter and radius,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly interchange the definitions and roles of diameter and radius in a circle. They may incorrectly identify the diameter as the distance from the center of a circle to its edge (which is actually the definition of the radius), or vice versa, thinking the radius is the distance across a circle passing through its center (which is actually the definition of the diameter). This mix-up can lead to errors in calculations involving circles, such as finding the circumference or area.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the area of a circle and using the diameter instead of the radius in the formula A = πr^2.
- When calculating the circumference of a circle and using the radius instead of the diameter in the formula C = πd.
- When drawing a circle and labeling the radius as the diameter or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving circular shapes in real-world contexts, such as the size of a circular table or the length of a circular track."
1687,Gives one fewer order of rotational symmetry than there is,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify the number of rotational symmetries of a shape. They may count the number of times the shape looks the same when rotated, but they might start counting from the original position as 0, or not include the full 360-degree rotation as a valid symmetry. As a result, they may give an answer that is one fewer than the actual number of rotational symmetries.

For example, this misconception might occur in the following cases:

- A student is asked to find the number of rotational symmetries of an equilateral triangle and says it has 2, instead of 3.
- A student is asked to identify the number of rotational symmetries of a square and says it has 3, instead of 4.
- A student is asked to find the number of rotational symmetries of a regular hexagon and says it has 5, instead of 6."
1688,Believes a line showing a constant rate of increase corresponds to a non-prism shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the shape of a graph and the shape of an object that the graph represents. A line showing a constant rate of increase typically represents a linear relationship between two variables, often leading students to associate it with straight-line motion or growth. However, when dealing with shapes, students might mistakenly think that a linear increase in one dimension (e.g., height) means the shape cannot be a prism (a three-dimensional shape with identical cross-sections). They might incorrectly associate a constant rate of increase with a shape that does not have a constant cross-sectional area, such as a non-prism shape like a cone or a sphere.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When graphing the height of a rectangular prism against its volume, students might expect a non-linear relationship because they think the shape is not a prism if its volume increases at a constant rate.
* When analyzing the growth of a shape, such as a tower built from blocks, students might believe that a constant rate of increase in height means the shape cannot be a prism.
* When working with real-world examples, like the growth of a tree, students might incorrectly assume that a linear increase in height means the tree's shape is not a prism (e.g., a cylinder)."
1689,Believes the largest number in a set of numbers is always their lowest common multiple,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the lowest common multiple (LCM). They may think that the LCM of a set of numbers is the largest number in the set, rather than the smallest number that all the numbers in the set can divide into evenly. This misconception can occur when students focus on the word ""largest"" and associate it with the LCM, or when they fail to understand that the LCM is a multiple that all the numbers in the set share.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the LCM of a set of numbers, such as 2, 4, and 6, a student may incorrectly say the LCM is 6 because it is the largest number in the set.
- When comparing the LCM of two sets of numbers, such as 2, 4, 6 and 2, 4, 8, a student may incorrectly say the LCM of the first set is 6 and the LCM of the second set is 8, simply because 6 and 8 are the largest numbers in their respective sets.
- When solving problems that involve finding the LCM, such as determining the least common multiple of the number of legs on different animals, a student may incorrectly identify the LCM as the largest number of legs."
1690,Assumes an addition pyramid works in a different way to how it actually does,"Explanation: An addition pyramid is often used to help students visualize and calculate the sum of a series of numbers. However, some students may have a misconception about how an addition pyramid works. They may think that the numbers in each row are simply added together without considering the cumulative effect of the previous rows. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate the sum of the numbers in the pyramid. They may also fail to recognize the pattern and relationship between the numbers in each row, which can hinder their ability to use the pyramid as a tool for solving problems.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to find the sum of a series of numbers using an addition pyramid, but they simply add the numbers in each row without considering the cumulative effect of the previous rows.
- When a student is given a word problem that involves an addition pyramid, but they fail to recognize the pattern and relationship between the numbers in each row.
- When a student is asked to create their own addition pyramid, but they set it up incorrectly due to a lack of understanding of how the numbers in each row relate to each other."
1691,Believes the solution of mx + c = 0 is x =0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of linear equations and assume that the solution to any equation in the form mx + c = 0 is always x = 0. They may overlook the fact that the value of 'c' can affect the solution and that 'm' is a coefficient of x, not a constant that can be ignored. They might also not fully grasp the concept of variables and constants in an equation.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When students are given a simple linear equation like 2x + 3 = 0 and they immediately conclude that x = 0 without considering the effect of the constant term (+3).
- When students are solving a linear equation with a non-zero constant term, like x + 4 = 0, and they still believe the solution is x = 0.
- When students are faced with a linear equation with a negative constant term, like 3x - 2 = 0, and they think that x = 0 is the solution, ignoring the negative term."
1692,Mixes up total and part when forming expressions from worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the total quantity and a part of it when translating word problems into algebraic expressions. They may incorrectly represent the total as a part or vice versa, leading to incorrect expressions.

For example, in the following cases, this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: Tom has 5 more pencils than his friend Alex. If Alex has x pencils, a student with this misconception may write an expression for Tom's pencils as x (instead of x + 5).
- Case 2: A bookshelf has 8 more books than the number of books on a nearby shelf. If the nearby shelf has x books, a student with this misconception may write an expression for the total number of books on the bookshelf as x + x (instead of x + 8).
- Case 3: Sarah has x marbles, and she gives 3 marbles to her brother. A student with this misconception may write an expression for the marbles Sarah has left as x + 3 (instead of x - 3).
- Case 4: A bakery sells a total of 250 loaves of bread per day. They sell a combination of whole wheat and white bread. If they sell x whole wheat loaves, a student with this misconception may write an expression for the white bread loaves as 250 (instead of 250 - x)."
1693,"Does not know the meaning of common, eg. common factor","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the term ""common"" in a mathematical context, specifically when dealing with factors, multiples, or other mathematical concepts. They may misunderstand that ""common"" refers to a shared characteristic or element between two or more numbers, sets, or objects. In the case of factors, a common factor is a whole number that divides two or more numbers exactly without leaving a remainder.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) or the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers, students may not understand what is meant by ""common"" and struggle to identify the shared factors.
- When simplifying fractions, students may not recognize the common factors between the numerator and denominator, making it difficult to simplify the fraction.
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios or proportions, students may not understand that the common factor is what makes the ratios equivalent.
- When working with algebraic expressions, students may not recognize common factors in terms, leading to difficulties in factoring or simplifying expressions."
1694,Believes that a discriminant of 0 means there are no real solutions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the quadratic formula and the concept of the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) in Algebra. The discriminant is used to determine the nature of the solutions of a quadratic equation. Students with this misconception believe that when the discriminant equals 0, the quadratic equation has no real solutions. However, they fail to understand the implication of a zero discriminant on the nature of the solutions.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When solving quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, and the discriminant is calculated to be 0.
* In problems involving the determination of the number of solutions of a quadratic equation, such as ""Find the number of solutions of the equation x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0"".
* When graphing quadratic functions and determining the number of x-intercepts, which corresponds to the number of real solutions of the related quadratic equation. A zero discriminant would imply a specific type of graph, but students with this misconception may misinterpret it as no real solutions, and therefore, no x-intercepts."
1695,Thinks you add all the bricks in a row in an addition pyramid.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with an addition pyramid or a triangular number sequence. In such sequences, each row has one more element than the previous row, forming a triangular pattern. The misconception occurs when students think that to find the total number of bricks or elements, they simply add all the bricks in each row, treating each row as an independent set, rather than considering the cumulative total. 

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When counting the total number of bricks in a triangular tower, where each row has one more brick than the previous row.
- When finding the total number of elements in a triangular number sequence, where each row represents a specific number.
- When solving a problem that involves adding consecutive integers, and the student incorrectly adds all the integers in each row, rather than considering the pattern of the sequence."
1696,Heads towards zero when subtracting from a negative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are subtracting a number from a negative number. They tend to incorrectly assume that subtracting from a negative number will always result in moving towards zero on the number line. This misunderstanding can lead students to believe that subtracting a positive number from a negative number will always make the result less negative, when in fact it becomes even more negative.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

* Subtracting 3 from -5: Students may think that -5 - 3 = -2, moving towards zero, instead of the correct answer, -8.
* Subtracting 2 from -4: Students may assume that -4 - 2 = -2 or even -1, when in reality, the correct answer is -6.
* Subtracting 1 from -2: Students might think that -2 - 1 = -1 or 0, instead of the correct answer, -3."
1697,Does not understand the link between the sign of the root and the sign in the bracket,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with square roots of negative numbers and the use of the negative sign outside the square root symbol. Students may struggle to understand that the sign of the root (positive or negative) is related to the sign of the number inside the bracket. They may not recognize that a negative sign outside the square root symbol is an instruction to change the sign of the result, rather than indicating a negative number inside the bracket. This misconception can lead to errors when simplifying expressions or solving equations involving square roots.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Simplifying expressions like √(-x) or -√x
* Solving equations like √(x) = -3 or -√(x) = 4
* Evaluating expressions like √(-16) or -√(25)
* Comparing the values of expressions like √(x) and -√(x) when x is a positive or negative number."
1698,Uses the whole base rather than half the base when forming a right angled triangle from an equilateral triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are tasked with finding the height of an equilateral triangle by creating a right-angled triangle within it. They incorrectly assume that the entire base of the equilateral triangle should be used as the base of the right-angled triangle, rather than recognizing that the altitude splits the equilateral triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles, each with half the base of the original equilateral triangle.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the height of an equilateral triangle with a given side length.
- Calculating the area of an equilateral triangle using the formula 0.5 * base * height.
- Constructing a right-angled triangle from an equilateral triangle to apply trigonometric ratios.
- Solving problems involving the properties of 30-60-90 triangles.
- Comparing the areas of different equilateral triangles."
1699,Thinks there are 60 degrees in a full turn,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a full turn or a full rotation is comprised of 60 degrees, rather than the correct 360 degrees. They may understand that an hour on a clock face has 60 minutes, and an angle of an equilateral triangle has 60 degrees, but they mistakenly generalize this to think that 60 degrees is the total amount in a full turn.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or measuring angles in degrees, students might label a full turn with 60 degrees instead of 360 degrees.
- When working with fractions of a turn, students might say that 1/6 of a turn is 10 degrees, instead of the correct 60 degrees.
- When asked to describe real-life situations involving rotation, such as the number of degrees in a merry-go-round's full rotation, students might respond with 60 degrees.
- When solving problems involving circular motion or geometry, students might calculate distances or angles using 60 degrees as the measure of a full turn, leading to incorrect results."
1700,Believes you need to know the value of all algebraic variables before any general conclusions can be made,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students think that in order to make any conclusions or solve problems involving algebraic expressions, they need to know the specific values of all variables involved. They may struggle to understand that algebraic expressions and equations can be manipulated, simplified, and solved without knowing the specific values of the variables.

For example, when faced with an equation like 2x + 5 = 11, students with this misconception may think they cannot solve for x unless they know the value of x beforehand. They may not realize that they can isolate x by performing inverse operations, such as subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

This misconception can also manifest when students are working with algebraic expressions, such as simplifying 2x + 3x. They may think that they need to know the value of x in order to simplify the expression, rather than recognizing that the expression can be simplified to 5x regardless of the value of x.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When solving linear equations, such as 2x + 3 = 7, and thinking that the value of x is needed to solve the equation.
* When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as 3x + 2x, and believing that the value of x is necessary to combine like terms.
* When working with quadratic equations, such as x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0, and thinking that the values of x are needed to factor the equation.
* When solving systems of linear equations, such as 2x + y = 4 and x - y = -1, and believing that the values of x and y are needed to solve the system."
1701,Believes the solutions of a quadratic equation are the absolute values of the constants in the factorised form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the factorised form of quadratic equations, typically in the form of (x - a)(x - b) = 0. They mistakenly believe that the solutions to the equation are the absolute values of the constants 'a' and 'b', rather than understanding that the solutions are the actual values of 'a' and 'b' including their signs. 

For example, if the factorised form of a quadratic equation is (x + 3)(x - 4) = 0, students with this misconception may think the solutions are |3| and |4|, which are 3 and 4, rather than the actual solutions, which are -3 and 4.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When solving quadratic equations in the form of (x + a)(x - b) = 0, where 'a' and 'b' are constants.
- When finding the roots of a quadratic equation in the form of x^2 + ax + b = 0, and then factorising it into the form (x + c)(x + d) = 0.
- When graphing quadratic functions and identifying the x-intercepts, which are the solutions to the equation."
1702,Does not know the 9 timestable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to recall the multiplication facts of the 9 times table, which can hinder their ability to perform calculations involving multiplication and division by 9. This can be due to a lack of practice, inadequate understanding of the patterns and relationships within the times table, or difficulty with memorization. As a result, students may rely on counting up or using inefficient strategies, leading to errors and a lack of confidence when dealing with calculations involving the 9 times table.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When asked to recall the product of 9 multiplied by a single-digit number (e.g., 9 x 7 = ?).
* When required to perform mental calculations involving the 9 times table, such as estimating the cost of 9 items or calculating the area of a rectangle with a length that is a multiple of 9.
* When solving multiplication and division word problems that involve the 9 times table, such as ""Tom has 9 groups of 6 pencils. How many pencils does Tom have in total?""
* When completing multiplication charts or tables and struggling to fill in the correct products for the 9 times table."
1703,When using a 180 degree protractor to measure reflex angles gives the value of the acute or obtuse angle that is a complement to 360,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using a 180-degree protractor to measure reflex angles. A reflex angle is an angle greater than 180 degrees and less than 360 degrees. When a student uses a 180-degree protractor, which is only designed to measure angles up to 180 degrees, they will only get the measure of the acute or obtuse angle formed by the protractor. They may mistakenly assume that this value is the measure of the reflex angle, not realizing that the protractor is not capable of measuring angles beyond 180 degrees. As a result, they will be getting the measure of the angle that is a complement to 360 degrees (i.e., the angle that, when added to the measured angle, equals 360 degrees), rather than the actual reflex angle.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When measuring the angle between two intersecting lines that form a reflex angle.
* When finding the measure of a reflex angle in a polygon or a circle.
* When solving problems that involve the calculation of reflex angles in geometry and trigonometry.
* When using a 180-degree protractor to measure angles in real-world applications, such as architecture, engineering, or design."
1704,Believes gradient = change in x/change in y,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly reverse the formula for calculating the gradient of a line. They incorrectly believe that the gradient is equal to the change in x divided by the change in y, rather than the correct formula: gradient = change in y / change in x. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of gradient, which represents the rate of change of y with respect to x.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When finding the gradient of a line given two points, e.g. (2,3) and (4,5), the student may calculate the gradient as (4-2)/(5-3) instead of (5-3)/(4-2).
* When interpreting the gradient of a line in a real-world context, e.g. the cost of goods vs. the number of goods sold, the student may incorrectly conclude that a higher change in the number of goods sold results in a lower cost per good.
* When graphing a line and determining its gradient, the student may mistakenly label the x-axis as the vertical axis and the y-axis as the horizontal axis, leading to an incorrect calculation of the gradient."
1705,Rounds to the nearest integer when estimating,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that rounding to the nearest integer is the sole method of estimation, particularly with decimal numbers or quantities. They tend to round every number to the nearest whole number, often ignoring the context of the problem, the degree of accuracy required, or the specific instruction given in the question.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When estimating quantities, such as the number of people attending an event, where students might always round to the nearest whole number (e.g., 45.7 is always rounded to 46) without considering whether a more or less precise estimate is required.
- In measurement problems, where students might round all measurements to the nearest whole number (e.g., 3.8 cm is rounded to 4 cm) without considering the precision needed for a specific task.
- When working with money, where students might round all amounts to the nearest whole number (e.g., $4.99 is rounded to $5) without considering the context of the transaction.
- In calculations involving decimals, where students might round intermediate results to the nearest whole number, which can lead to inaccurate final answers."
1706,"When calculating perimeter, only adds the marked lengths","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the perimeter of a shape and they only consider the lengths that are explicitly marked or labeled, ignoring the fact that the perimeter is the total distance around the shape. They may overlook the unmarked sides, assuming they don't contribute to the perimeter. This misconception can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate calculation of the perimeter.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A rectangle with only the length and width marked, where the student only adds these two values, ignoring the other two sides.
2. A triangle with only two sides labeled, where the student only adds these two values, forgetting to calculate the third side.
3. A shape with some sides marked in a different unit (e.g., inches and feet), where the student only adds the sides with the same unit, neglecting the others.
4. A complex shape, such as a polygon, where the student only adds the marked sides, overlooking the unmarked sides that are still part of the perimeter."
1707,Misinterprets the meaning of angles on a straight line angle fact,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept that the sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. They may think that this rule only applies to certain situations or types of angles, or that it's not a fixed rule. Some students may believe that the angles need to be equal or congruent to add up to 180 degrees, or that the rule only applies to specific types of angles, such as right angles or acute angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the missing angle in a diagram where two angles are shown on a straight line, a student with this misconception may not apply the 180-degree rule correctly.
- When given a problem involving multiple angles on a straight line, a student may not recognize that the sum of all the angles is 180 degrees, leading to incorrect calculations.
- In a geometry problem, a student may incorrectly assume that the angles need to be equal to add up to 180 degrees, rather than understanding that the sum of any two angles on a straight line is always 180 degrees."
1708,Does not understand place value within a number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of place value within a number. Place value refers to the value of each digit in a number based on its position. Students with this misconception may not understand that each digit in a number has a specific place value, such as hundreds, tens, or ones. They may also have difficulty recognizing the relationship between digits in different places, such as understanding that 10 tens equal 1 hundred.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, including:

* Difficulty reading and writing numbers, particularly multi-digit numbers.
* Trouble comparing numbers or ordering them from least to greatest.
* Inability to round numbers to the nearest ten, hundred, or thousand.
* Struggling with basic arithmetic operations, such as addition and subtraction, due to a lack of understanding of place value.
* Difficulty solving problems that involve regrouping or ""borrowing"" in subtraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student writes the number 456 as 4006, indicating a lack of understanding of the place value of each digit.
* When asked to compare the numbers 345 and 354, a student incorrectly states that 345 is greater because they do not understand the place value of the tens and ones digits.
* A student struggles to round the number 432 to the nearest ten, instead rounding it to 400 or 500.
* When solving a subtraction problem, such as 456 - 278, a student becomes confused about how to regroup the digits due to a lack of understanding of place value."
1709,Believes a factor pair doesn't have to be 2 integers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of factor pairs. They may understand that a factor pair consists of two numbers that multiply together to give a specific product, but they may not fully grasp the idea that these numbers must be integers. As a result, they may believe that a factor pair can include fractions, decimals, or even negative numbers, as long as they multiply together to give the correct product.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding factor pairs of a given number, a student may include pairs such as 3.5 and 2.86 as a factor pair of 10, because 3.5 x 2.86 is approximately equal to 10.
- When solving problems that involve factorization, a student may break down a number into a product of a fraction and a whole number, such as 6 = 1/2 x 12, and consider 1/2 and 12 as a factor pair.
- When asked to generate all possible factor pairs of a given number, a student may include pairs that involve negative numbers, such as -2 and -5 as a factor pair of 10."
1710,"When finding a percentage of an amount, assumes they divide the percentage by 10, but not the amount, before multiplying","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating a percentage of a given amount. They understand that percentages are related to tenths or tens, but incorrectly assume that only the percentage value needs to be divided by 10 (or converted to a decimal) to make it ""workable."" As a result, they fail to recognize the importance of converting the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100 and instead divide the percentage by 10, while leaving the amount unchanged.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Find 25% of 120. Student might calculate it as (25 ÷ 10) × 120 = 2.5 × 120 = 300, which is incorrect.
- Case 2: A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of $80. Student might calculate the discount as (15 ÷ 10) × 80 = 1.5 × 80 = $120, which is incorrect.
- Case 3: A recipe calls for a 20% increase in the amount of sugar. If the original amount is 250g, the student might calculate the additional sugar needed as (20 ÷ 10) × 250 = 2 × 250 = 500g, which is incorrect."
1711,Is not familiar with the names of the different parts of a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not properly introduced to or struggle to recall the terminology used to describe the different components of a fraction. A fraction consists of three main parts: the numerator, the denominator, and the vinculum (or the fraction bar). The numerator is the number on top of the fraction, the denominator is the number on the bottom, and the vinculum is the line that separates them.

Students who are not familiar with these terms may have difficulty expressing themselves when talking about fractions, and may not fully understand the roles that each part plays in the overall value of the fraction. This can lead to confusion when comparing, adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify or label the different parts of a fraction, a student may incorrectly identify the numerator as the ""top number"" or the denominator as the ""bottom number"" without knowing the proper terms.
- When given a fraction problem, a student may not understand the concept of equivalent fractions because they don't grasp how changing the numerator and denominator affects the value of the fraction.
- In word problems involving fractions, a student may become confused because they don't understand what part of the fraction the problem is referring to, leading to incorrect calculations or answers."
1712,"Includes all faces when finding surface area of a compound shape, including those which are stuck together","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the surface area of a compound shape, which is a shape made up of multiple simple shapes. The students mistakenly include the areas of the faces that are shared between the individual shapes, essentially counting them twice. This is because they do not understand that these shared faces are not visible and therefore should not be included in the total surface area.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When finding the surface area of a cube made up of smaller cubes stuck together, students may include the areas of the faces where the smaller cubes touch each other.
- When calculating the surface area of a shape made up of multiple rectangular prisms joined at their bases, students may include the areas of the joined bases.
- When determining the surface area of a compound shape consisting of multiple pyramids or cones sharing a common base, students may include the area of the shared base multiple times."
1713,Believes inverse function notation means multiplying by negative 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the notation of an inverse function, often denoted as f^(-1)(x), means that the original function f(x) should be multiplied by -1. They fail to understand that the superscript (-1) in this context represents the inverse operation, not a multiplication by a negative number. As a result, when asked to find an inverse function, they simply multiply the original function by -1, rather than reversing the operation.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When finding the inverse of a simple function like f(x) = 2x, students might think the inverse is f^(-1)(x) = -2x, rather than f^(-1)(x) = x/2.
* When working with trigonometric functions, students might think the inverse of sin(x) is -sin(x), rather than the actual inverse sine function.
* When dealing with more complex functions, such as quadratic functions, students might think the inverse can be found by simply multiplying the function by -1, rather than using the correct method of switching x and y and solving for y."
1714,"When completing the square, believes the constant in the bracket is the square root of the coefficient of x","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They mistakenly think that when rewriting the expression in the form (x + a)^2, the constant 'a' within the bracket is the square root of the coefficient of x, rather than half of the coefficient of x. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect solutions and further errors when working with quadratic equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving quadratic equations of the form x^2 + bx + c = 0, students may incorrectly identify the value to be added inside the bracket.
- In problems involving the rewriting of quadratic expressions in the form (x + a)^2 + c, students may mistakenly calculate the constant 'a'.
- When working with quadratic equations that have a coefficient of x that is not equal to 1, students may apply this misconception and arrive at incorrect solutions."
1715,Converts a fraction to a decimal by using only the numerator after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of converting a fraction to a decimal. They incorrectly assume that to convert a fraction to a decimal, they simply need to write the numerator after the decimal point, ignoring the denominator. For example, they might think that the fraction 3/4 is equal to 3.0 or 3.00, or that 2/5 is equal to 2.0.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When converting simple fractions to decimals, e.g., 1/2, 3/4, 2/5, etc.
- When dealing with real-world applications, like measuring ingredients for cooking or measuring the length of an object, where fractions need to be converted to decimals for calculations.
- When performing arithmetic operations with fractions, such as adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, and then converting the result to a decimal.
- When solving problems involving percentages, ratios, or proportions, where fractions need to be converted to decimals for calculations.
- When graphing or analyzing data, and fractions need to be converted to decimals for plotting or calculations."
1716,Goes the wrong direction in the sequence when identifying term-to-term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are identifying the term-to-term rule in a sequence, but instead of going in the correct direction (e.g. adding or subtracting a certain number to get to the next term), they go in the opposite direction. For example, if a sequence is increasing by 2 each time, the student might think it decreases by 2 each time, or if a sequence is obtained by multiplying the previous term by a certain number, the student might think it is obtained by dividing the previous term by that number.

This misconception can lead to incorrect identification of the term-to-term rule, which can then lead to incorrect predictions of future terms in the sequence.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* A sequence is given as 2, 5, 8, 11, ... and the student thinks the next term is 8 (going backwards instead of forwards).
* A sequence is given as 1, 2, 4, 8, ... and the student thinks the next term is 4 (dividing instead of multiplying).
* A sequence is given as 10, 8, 6, 4, ... and the student thinks the next term is 6 (adding instead of subtracting).
* A sequence is given as 3, 6, 12, 24, ... and the student thinks the next term is 12 (dividing instead of multiplying)."
1717,Swaps the dividend and divisor in order to get an integer answer,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly switch the positions of the dividend and divisor in a division problem, thinking that doing so will yield an integer result. This often happens when they are faced with a division problem that doesn't result in a whole number. By swapping the dividend and divisor, they incorrectly assume that the resulting quotient will be an integer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: 12 ÷ 5 = ? (Student incorrectly rewrites as 5 ÷ 12 to get an integer answer)
- Case 2: 18 ÷ 7 = ? (Student incorrectly rewrites as 7 ÷ 18 to get an integer answer)
- Case 3: 24 ÷ 9 = ? (Student incorrectly rewrites as 9 ÷ 24, even though the original division problem already yields an integer result)"
1718,Thinks there are 100 seconds in an hour,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the relationships between different units of time. They may correctly recall that there are 100 cents in a dollar or 100 years in a century, but incorrectly apply this pattern to units of time, assuming that there are 100 seconds in an hour. However, this is not the case, as seconds and hours are units of time with a different conversion rate.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When converting between units of time, e.g., converting hours to seconds or vice versa.
- When solving word problems involving time, e.g., ""If it takes 2 hours to complete a task, how many seconds will it take?""
- When reading and interpreting time-related data in graphs or charts.
- When performing calculations involving rates or speeds measured in units of time.
- When working with real-world applications, such as calculating the time it takes for a vehicle to travel a certain distance."
1719,Believes a rhombus has one pair of equal sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a partial understanding of the properties of a rhombus. They may recall that some quadrilaterals have one pair of equal sides, such as a kite or an isosceles trapezoid. However, they may not fully grasp the definition of a rhombus, which states that all four sides are of equal length. As a result, they may mistakenly believe that a rhombus only has one pair of equal sides, rather than all sides being equal.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When identifying shapes: Students may incorrectly identify a rhombus as a different type of quadrilateral, such as a kite or a parallelogram, due to their misunderstanding of its side properties.
- When drawing shapes: Students may draw a quadrilateral with only one pair of equal sides and mistakenly label it as a rhombus.
- When solving problems: Students may incorrectly apply the properties of a rhombus to solve problems, leading to incorrect solutions or calculations."
1720,Identifies the term-to-term rule rather than the next term,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly focus on identifying a pattern or rule that describes the relationship between consecutive terms in a sequence, rather than using the pattern or rule to find the next term. 

In other words, students may be able to identify the difference or ratio between consecutive terms but fail to apply it to determine the next term in the sequence. For example, given the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, a student may recognize that each term increases by 3, but when asked to find the next term, they simply state the rule (""add 3"") instead of using it to calculate the next term (14).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is given the sequence 1, 2, 4, 8 and is asked to identify the next term. They correctly identify the pattern as ""doubling the previous term"" but write the answer as ""doubling"" instead of 16.

2. A student is asked to find the next term in the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12. They correctly identify the pattern as ""adding 3"" but fail to apply it to find the next term, writing the answer as ""add 3"" instead of 15.

3. A student is given the sequence 2, 6, 12, 20 and is asked to identify the next term. They recognize that each term increases by 4, then 6, then 8, but instead of using this pattern to find the next term, they simply state the rule (""add 4, then 6, then 8"") instead of calculating the next term (30)."
1721,Does not recall the steps required to draw an angle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to recall the steps or procedure to draw a specific angle using a protractor or other geometric tools. They may struggle to remember the correct placement of the protractor, the alignment of the angle's vertex, or the counting of degrees. This can lead to inaccurate drawings and measurements of angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to draw a 45-degree angle using a protractor, a student places the protractor's center point at the wrong location, resulting in an incorrect angle.
- A student is tasked with drawing a 90-degree angle but fails to align the protractor's zero line with one of the angle's sides, leading to an inaccurate measurement.
- When asked to draw an angle of 120 degrees, a student counts the degrees incorrectly, resulting in an angle that is either too large or too small."
1722,Believes a subtraction cannot be partitioned into separate subtractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that a subtraction problem must be solved as a whole and cannot be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts. They may think that once a subtraction has been started, it has to be completed in a single step, without the possibility of splitting it into separate subtractions.

For example, when faced with a problem like 45 - 27, students with this misconception may feel that they need to perform the entire subtraction at once, rather than breaking it down into smaller parts, such as 45 - 20 and then 25 - 7.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- 75 - 32 = ?
- 247 - 119 = ?
- 943 - 279 = ?

In these cases, students may struggle to break down the subtraction into smaller parts, making the calculation more difficult than necessary."
1723,Assumes all journeys of the same distance take the same amount of time,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that the time taken to travel a certain distance is constant, regardless of the mode of transport, route, or any other factors that may affect the journey. Students with this misconception may believe that as long as the distance is the same, the time taken will always be the same. They fail to consider variables such as speed, traffic, road conditions, and other factors that can impact the duration of a journey.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the time taken to travel to school by car versus by bicycle, a student may assume that both journeys take the same amount of time because the distance is the same.
- When planning a trip, a student may estimate the time of arrival based solely on the distance, without considering the mode of transport or potential delays.
- When solving problems involving speed and distance, a student may incorrectly assume that the time taken is constant, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When analyzing data on travel times, a student may fail to account for variations in journey times due to different factors, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When planning a route, a student may choose a route that is the same distance as another option, but takes significantly longer due to traffic or other factors."
1724,"When completing the square, believes that a is always half the x-coefficient. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic equations. They mistakenly believe that when rewriting the quadratic equation in the form (x + a)^2, the value of 'a' is always half of the coefficient of x. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect completion of the square and ultimately incorrect solutions to the quadratic equation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When the coefficient of x^2 is not 1, for example, in the equation 2x^2 + 6x + 1, where students might think 'a' is half of 6, which is 3, without considering the coefficient of x^2.
- When the quadratic equation has a negative coefficient of x, for example, in the equation x^2 - 4x + 2, where students might think 'a' is half of -4, which is -2, without considering the sign.
- When the quadratic equation has a coefficient of x that is a fraction, for example, in the equation x^2 + (3/2)x + 1, where students might think 'a' is half of 3/2, which is 3/4, without considering the fraction correctly."
1725,"Does not recognise inches ("") as a unit of length","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are not familiar with or do not understand that inches ("") is a unit of measurement for length, commonly used in everyday applications, particularly in the United States. They may only be familiar with metric units such as centimeters (cm) or meters (m) and may not recognize inches as a valid unit of length, leading to confusion when dealing with measurements or conversions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading or interpreting measurements in real-life scenarios, such as measuring the length of a room or the height of a person, and the unit is given in inches.
- When working with problems that involve converting between different units of length, such as converting inches to centimeters or vice versa.
- When solving problems that involve calculating perimeter, area, or volume of objects, and the measurements are given in inches.
- When interpreting or creating scale drawings or diagrams, and the measurements are given in inches.
- When working with everyday applications, such as building or carpentry, where inches are commonly used as a unit of measurement."
1726,Believes there is more than one line which passes through a given pair of points,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a lack of understanding of the fundamental concept in geometry that states a line is defined by two distinct points. They might think that it's possible to draw multiple lines through the same pair of points, perhaps by drawing lines that are not straight or by assuming that a line can be drawn in different directions from the same points.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing a line graph and believing that multiple lines can be drawn to connect two data points.
- When working with coordinate geometry, thinking that multiple lines can pass through two given coordinates.
- When solving problems involving intersecting lines, assuming that more than one line can intersect at the same two points.
- When visualizing shapes and assuming that multiple lines can be drawn between two vertices of a shape.
- When solving construction problems in geometry, attempting to draw multiple lines through the same pair of points to create different shapes or angles."
1727,Rounds the wrong way when interpreting a real-life context,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly round numbers in real-life scenarios, often due to a lack of understanding of the context or the purpose of rounding. For example, when calculating the cost of items, students may round down to the nearest whole number or decimal place, resulting in an inaccurate total cost. This misconception can also arise when students are working with measurements, such as lengths or capacities, and round in the wrong direction, leading to incorrect conclusions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A recipe requires 2.7 cups of flour, but a student rounds down to 2 cups, resulting in an incorrect amount of flour needed.
* A student is calculating the cost of items at the store and rounds the total cost down from $12.95 to $12.00, underestimating the actual cost.
* A measurement of a room's length is 5.8 meters, but a student rounds up to 6 meters, leading to an incorrect calculation of the room's area or perimeter.
* A water tank can hold 240.5 liters of water, but a student rounds down to 240 liters, underestimating the tank's capacity."
1728,"When solving a pair of simultaneous equations, thinks they need to make the coefficients of both variables the same","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the method of substitution or elimination in solving simultaneous equations. They mistakenly believe that in order to solve the equations, the coefficients of both variables (e.g., x and y) need to be made the same. However, in the elimination method, it's actually about making the coefficients of either x or y (but not necessarily both) the same, so that when the equations are added or subtracted, one of the variables can be eliminated.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When solving the equations 2x + 3y = 5 and 4x + 5y = 11, the student tries to multiply the equations by numbers that make both coefficients of x and y the same.
- When dealing with equations like x + 2y = 3 and 3x - 2y = 5, the student attempts to change the coefficients of both x and y to match, rather than focusing on eliminating one variable.
- When working with equations such as 2x + 4y = 6 and x - 3y = -2, the student incorrectly tries to make the coefficients of both x and y the same, rather than using substitution or elimination methods correctly."
1729,"When solving simultaneous equations, finds the correct numbers to transform the equations, but uses them the wrong way around.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the concept of using coefficients or multiples to eliminate variables in simultaneous equations but get confused with the application. They might correctly identify the numbers needed to transform the equations, such as multiplying one equation by a certain number to match coefficients, but incorrectly apply these transformations. This could involve multiplying the wrong equation, using the wrong operation (e.g., addition instead of subtraction), or applying the transformation to the wrong variable.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When trying to eliminate a variable by making coefficients the same, a student might multiply the equation that already has the desired coefficient, instead of the one that needs to be adjusted.
- In an attempt to eliminate a variable, a student might add two equations when they should subtract, or vice versa, due to misunderstanding the signs of the coefficients.
- A student might identify the correct transformation to apply to one variable but incorrectly apply it to the other variable in the equation, failing to eliminate the variable as intended.
- When dealing with equations that require multiple steps to solve, students might apply the correct transformation in one step but incorrectly apply subsequent transformations, leading to incorrect solutions."
1730,"When adding decimals with a different number of decimal places, lines up the digits incorrectly","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding decimals with a different number of decimal places. They may incorrectly line up the digits, often aligning the rightmost digits or simply adding the numbers as if they were whole numbers, ignoring the decimal places. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of place value in decimals, where each digit's place represents a power of 10.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding 2.5 and 1.25, a student may incorrectly line up the digits as:
  2.5
+1.25
------
  3.75 ( incorrect alignment, but correct answer by coincidence)
  Or
  2.50
+12.5 (incorrect alignment)

- When adding 4.2 and 3.125, a student may incorrectly line up the digits as:
  4.2
+3.125
------
  7.3 (incorrect alignment and incorrect answer)
  Or
  4.20
+31.25 (incorrect alignment)

- When adding 5 and 2.75, a student may incorrectly line up the digits as:
  5
+2.75
------
  7.75 (incorrect alignment, but correct answer by coincidence)
  Or
  50
+2.75 (incorrect alignment)"
1731,Makes an assumption about the squares on a scale representing either 1 or 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with scales, graphs, or number lines that have square or grid markings. They tend to assume that each square on the scale represents either a single unit (1) or a multiple of ten (10), without considering the possibility of other scale factors. This can lead to incorrect interpretations of data, graphs, or measurements.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading a graph with a partial scale, a student assumes that each square represents 1 unit and misinterprets the data.
- When working with a map scale, a student assumes that each square represents 10 units of distance, resulting in incorrect calculations of actual distances.
- When measuring the length of an object on a ruler with non-standard markings, a student assumes that each square represents 1 unit, leading to incorrect measurements.
- When interpreting a histogram, a student assumes that each square on the x-axis represents 10 units, misinterpreting the data distribution."
1732,Thinks a factor tree splits a number into a pair of numbers that sum to the given number.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of factorization and factor trees. They mistakenly believe that a factor tree is used to break down a number into two parts that add up to the original number, rather than finding the factors that multiply together to give the original number. This shows a lack of understanding of the difference between addition and multiplication, and how they relate to factors.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When a student is asked to find the factors of 12 and they respond with 5 and 7, because 5 + 7 = 12, instead of finding the correct factors such as 2, 2, and 3 that multiply together to give 12.
- When a student is given the number 18 and they draw a ""factor tree"" with branches 9 and 9, because 9 + 9 = 18, instead of finding the correct factors such as 2, 3, and 3 that multiply together to give 18.
- When a student is asked to factorize a number like 24 and they respond with 10 and 14, because 10 + 14 = 24, instead of finding the correct factors such as 2, 2, 2, and 3 that multiply together to give 24."
1733,Confuses tangent and chord,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definitions and properties of tangents and chords in geometry, particularly in the context of circles. A tangent is a line that touches a circle at exactly one point, whereas a chord is a line segment that connects two points on the circle. Students may confuse these two concepts, thinking that a tangent is a line that intersects the circle at two points, or that a chord is a line that touches the circle at only one point.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing diagrams of circles and lines, students may incorrectly label a chord as a tangent or vice versa.
- When solving problems involving circle geometry, students may apply the wrong properties of tangents or chords, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as design or engineering, students may misinterpret the role of tangents and chords in the context of circular shapes or motion.
- When solving problems involving angles and triangles within circles, students may incorrectly apply tangent or chord properties, leading to incorrect angle measurements or relationships.
- When differentiating between secants and tangents, students may incorrectly identify a secant as a tangent or a tangent as a secant, leading to confusion in more advanced geometric concepts."
1734,Thinks that we can remove a division symbol and just write the variables next to each other,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the division operation can be simply omitted by writing the variables side by side, effectively treating division as an invisible or implicit operation. They may think that writing two variables next to each other automatically implies division, without realizing that this notation is typically reserved for multiplication. 

For example, when given the expression 'a ÷ b', they might rewrite it as 'ab' and treat it as a single entity, rather than recognizing that the division symbol is necessary to convey the intended operation. This misconception can lead to confusion and incorrect calculations, particularly when dealing with algebraic expressions or equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions, such as rewriting '12 ÷ x' as '12x' and not recognizing the difference between the two expressions.
- Solving equations, like 'x ÷ 4 = 6' and rewriting it as 'x4 = 6', which would lead to an incorrect solution.
- Interpreting algebraic expressions, such as 'a ÷ b + c' and rewriting it as 'ab + c', changing the intended meaning of the expression."
1735,Does not realise a quadratic must be in the form ax^2+bx+c=0 to find the values for the quadratic formula,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the conditions required to apply the quadratic formula. They may believe that the quadratic formula can be used with any quadratic expression, regardless of its form. However, the quadratic formula is specifically designed to solve quadratic equations in the standard form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants.

In this misconception, students may attempt to apply the quadratic formula to quadratic expressions that are not in the standard form, such as:

- Quadratic expressions with the x^2 term not isolated (e.g., x^2 + 4x = 2x^2 - 3)
- Quadratic expressions with the x term or constant term missing (e.g., x^2 = 4 or x^2 + 3x = 0, but without the constant term explicitly written as 0)
- Quadratic expressions in non-standard forms, such as x^2 + 2 = 3x or (x+2)^2 = 4

When this misconception occurs, students may plug incorrect values into the quadratic formula, leading to incorrect solutions or no solutions at all."
1736,Believes clock times can be written with a decimal point rather than a colon,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with decimal points being used to separate numbers, but they incorrectly apply this to time-telling. They might believe that writing clock times with a decimal point (e.g., 3.45) is equivalent to writing it with a colon (3:45). This misconception could stem from the fact that in other mathematical contexts, such as measurements or money, decimal points are used to separate units from fractions of a unit.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are writing times in a numerical format, especially when using digital devices that often use decimal points for other numerical inputs.
- When converting between time units, such as converting hours and minutes to just hours, and incorrectly using a decimal point to represent the fractional part of the hour (e.g., 3 hours 45 minutes as 3.45 hours, but then incorrectly writing 3.45 as a clock time).
- When solving time-based word problems, such as calculating elapsed time or scheduling appointments, and incorrectly writing the answer with a decimal point instead of a colon."
1737,Only looks at the difference between one pair of terms when discerning the pattern,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are trying to identify a pattern in a sequence, but they only consider the difference between two consecutive terms, rather than examining the entire sequence for a consistent pattern or relationship. They may assume that if the difference between one pair of terms is consistent, then that is the pattern, without checking if it holds true for the rest of the sequence.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify a pattern, especially if the sequence is not a simple arithmetic progression. For example, if the sequence is formed by adding 2, then 4, then 6, and so on, a student with this misconception may only look at the difference between the first two terms (e.g., 2) and assume that the pattern is formed by adding 2 each time.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A student is given the sequence 2, 4, 6, 10, 16 and assumes the pattern is adding 2 each time because the difference between the first two terms is 2.
* A student is given the sequence 1, 3, 6, 10, 15 and assumes the pattern is adding 2 each time because the difference between the first two terms is 2.
* A student is given the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14 and assumes the pattern is adding 3 each time because the difference between the first two terms is 3."
1738,Uses sin when cos is required,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the sine function instead of the cosine function in trigonometric problems, often due to a lack of understanding of the relationships between the angles and side lengths in triangles. This can happen when students are not familiar with the definitions of sine and cosine or when they fail to identify the correct angle or side lengths in a given problem.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle and using sin instead of cos.
- When calculating the cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle but using the opposite side and hypotenuse, which is the definition of sine.
- When solving problems involving the cosine rule, but incorrectly applying the sine rule.
- When graphing trigonometric functions and mistakenly plotting the graph of the sine function instead of the cosine function."
1739,Does not understand changing decimals to fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the relationship between decimals and fractions. They may not grasp that a decimal can be converted into a fraction by writing it as a numerator over a denominator that is a power of 10, or by simplifying it into its simplest form. Students may incorrectly assume that decimals and fractions are two separate entities, and not realize that they are different representations of the same value.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting a decimal to a fraction with a repeating or non-repeating pattern (e.g., 0.5 to 1/2, 0.33 to 1/3).
- When simplifying fractions obtained from decimal conversions (e.g., 4/10 to 2/5).
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for cooking or dividing quantities in science experiments, where decimal and fraction conversions are necessary.
- When comparing or ordering decimals and fractions, where students may incorrectly assume that one form is larger or smaller than the other.
- When performing mathematical operations, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing decimals and fractions, where conversion between the two forms is necessary."
1740,Does not recognise the properties of a kite,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not fully understand the characteristics of a kite as a geometric shape. A kite is a type of quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. Students with this misconception may not recognize that a kite has one pair of opposite angles that are equal, which are the angles formed by the two pairs of adjacent sides, or they might not understand the relationship between the diagonals of a kite.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Students assuming that a kite is just any quadrilateral with two pairs of equal sides, without considering the specific arrangement of those sides.
- Difficulty identifying the equal angles in a kite or understanding why they are equal.
- Inability to recognize that the diagonals of a kite are perpendicular and that one diagonal bisects the other.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify and name different types of quadrilaterals, students might incorrectly label a shape as a kite without checking its properties.
2. When given a diagram of a kite and asked to find the measure of its angles, students may not recognize which angles are equal.
3. When asked to draw or construct a kite, students might create a shape that does not have the correct properties."
1741,Confuses diameter and chord,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty distinguishing between a diameter and a chord in a circle. A diameter is a line segment that passes through the center of a circle and connects two points on the circle's circumference, whereas a chord is a line segment that connects two points on the circle's circumference but does not necessarily pass through the center. 

Students with this misconception may think that any line segment that connects two points on the circle's circumference is a diameter, or that the terms ""diameter"" and ""chord"" are interchangeable. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when working with circles, especially when dealing with properties like the center, radius, and circumference.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify the diameter of a circle, a student might point to any chord, thinking that it is the diameter.
2. When calculating the circumference or area of a circle, a student might use the length of a chord instead of the diameter or radius.
3. In a geometry problem, a student might assume that a chord is the same as a diameter and use its properties incorrectly.
4. When drawing a circle and asked to draw the diameter, the student might draw a chord that does not pass through the center of the circle.
5. When solving problems involving circle theorems, such as the angle in a semicircle or the intersecting chords theorem, the student's misunderstanding of diameter and chord can lead to incorrect applications of the theorems."
1742,Adds or subtracts the degree of accuracy from the original number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of rounding numbers to a specific degree of accuracy. They may think that to round a number to a certain degree of accuracy, they need to simply add or subtract the degree of accuracy from the original number. For example, if asked to round 45.67 to the nearest whole number, they may add or subtract 1 (the degree of accuracy) from the original number, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Rounding 23.4 to the nearest whole number: A student may add 1 to 23.4, resulting in 24.4, or subtract 1, resulting in 22.4.
* Rounding 12.98 to one decimal place: A student may add 0.1 to 12.98, resulting in 13.08, or subtract 0.1, resulting in 12.88.
* Rounding 4.25 to the nearest tenth: A student may add 0.1 to 4.25, resulting in 4.35, or subtract 0.1, resulting in 4.15."
1743,Believes that the coefficient of x represents the gradient even when a line is not in the form y = mx+c,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to linear equations in the form of y = mx + c, where 'm' represents the gradient of the line. However, they may incorrectly generalize this concept to all linear equations, assuming that the coefficient of x always represents the gradient, regardless of the equation's form. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect interpretations and calculations when dealing with linear equations in different forms, such as x + 2y = 3 or 2x - 3y = 5.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When the equation is in the form x + ay = b, students might think the gradient is 'a'.
- When the equation is in the form ax - by = c, students might think the gradient is 'a' or '-b'.
- When the equation is in the form ax = by + c, students might think the gradient is 'a' or 'b'.
- When rearranging an equation to isolate y, students might incorrectly identify the coefficient of x as the gradient, without properly rearranging the equation into the form y = mx + c."
1744,Rounded to nearest 100 instead of 1sf,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round a number to one significant figure (1sf), but instead, they round it to the nearest 100. This indicates that they have not fully understood the concept of significant figures, which is a way of expressing the precision of a number. Significant figures are used to convey the accuracy of a measurement or calculation, and rounding to 1sf means keeping only the most significant digit and making the rest of the digits zero.

Rounding to the nearest 100, on the other hand, is a method of approximating numbers to the nearest multiple of 100, regardless of the number of significant figures. This can lead to inaccurate results and loss of precision.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When dealing with large numbers: For example, if a student is asked to round 456,789 to 1sf, they might incorrectly round it to 500,000 (nearest 100,000) instead of 500,000 (1sf).
- In scientific calculations: Students may be asked to perform calculations involving large or small numbers and then round their answers to 1sf. If they incorrectly round to the nearest 100, it could lead to incorrect conclusions.
- In everyday applications: When dealing with money or measurements, students may be asked to round amounts or quantities to 1sf. If they round to the nearest 100 instead, it could result in inaccurate financial calculations or measurements."
1745,Believes a quadratic graph can be a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a quadratic equation, typically represented as ax^2 + bx + c = 0, can result in a straight-line graph. They may incorrectly assume that a quadratic equation can simplify to a linear equation, which would indeed produce a straight line on a graph. This misunderstanding might stem from an incomplete grasp of the characteristics of quadratic equations and their corresponding graphical representations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When simplifying a quadratic equation, students might overlook or incorrectly cancel out the squared term (x^2), leading them to believe the equation represents a straight line.
2. Students may incorrectly identify a quadratic equation as linear if the coefficient of the squared term (a) is very small or zero, resulting in a nearly linear or linear graph, respectively.
3. When graphing quadratic equations, students may mistakenly draw a straight line if they plot only two points and incorrectly assume that the graph continues linearly between and beyond these points.
4. When solving quadratic equations, students may find a single solution and incorrectly conclude that the equation represents a straight line, as they associate a single solution with a linear equation."
1746,Does not know the term 'diameter',"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unfamiliar with the term 'diameter' in the context of geometry, specifically in reference to a circle. They may not understand that the diameter is a line segment that passes through the center of a circle, connecting two points on the circle's circumference. As a result, they may struggle to identify or calculate the diameter of a circle, or confuse it with other circle-related terms, such as radius or circumference.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to label the parts of a circle, they may incorrectly identify the diameter or not label it at all.
- When solving problems involving circle measurements, students may confuse the diameter with the radius, leading to incorrect calculations.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring the diameter of a circular object, students may not understand what is being asked or how to measure it correctly.
- In construction or design activities involving circles, students may not take into account the diameter of the circle, leading to incorrect or incomplete designs."
1747,"When using the capture-recapture method of sampling, believes you multiply the number caught second by the number marked second to get the best estimate of population size","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the formula used in the capture-recapture method of sampling. They incorrectly believe that by multiplying the number of individuals caught in the second sample by the number of individuals marked in the second sample, they will obtain the best estimate of the population size. This error likely stems from a misunderstanding of the purpose of marking individuals in the first sample and how it relates to estimating the population size.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to the capture-recapture method and struggle to understand the formula and its application.
- When students are given a scenario where the numbers caught and marked in the second sample are provided, but they are not given the opportunity to practice using the correct formula.
- When students are working with real-world data and incorrectly apply the formula, leading to an inaccurate estimate of population size.
- When students are comparing the effectiveness of different sampling methods and incorrectly conclude that the capture-recapture method involves multiplying the number caught second by the number marked second."
1748,"Believes that when a shape touches the mirror line, all of its vertices will stay the same when reflected","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reflection in geometry. They may think that if a part of the shape touches the mirror line, the reflected image will be identical to the original shape at those points, resulting in the vertices remaining the same. This misconception can be due to a lack of understanding of the true nature of reflection, where each point of the original shape is mapped to a corresponding point on the opposite side of the mirror line.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When reflecting a triangle or a polygon that has one of its sides on the mirror line, students may assume that the vertices on the mirror line will not change position.
* When reflecting a shape with a vertex on the mirror line, students may think that the reflected vertex will be the same as the original vertex, rather than being on the opposite side of the mirror line.
* When reflecting a shape that has a side or a part of it coinciding with the mirror line, students may believe that the reflected image will be the same as the original shape at those points, rather than being a mirror image."
1749,"When dividing fractions, does the reciprocal of both fractions","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing fractions. They may mistakenly believe that to divide one fraction by another, they need to find the reciprocal of both fractions and then multiply. This would result in taking the reciprocal of both the dividend (the fraction being divided) and the divisor (the fraction by which we are dividing), rather than just taking the reciprocal of the divisor.

For example, given the problem 1/2 ÷ 3/4, students with this misconception may incorrectly think that the first step is to find the reciprocal of both 1/2 and 3/4, resulting in 2/1 and 4/3, respectively. They would then multiply these two fractions together.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- 3/4 ÷ 2/5, where students might take the reciprocal of both 3/4 and 2/5.
- 1/3 ÷ 4/7, where students might find the reciprocal of both 1/3 and 4/7.
- 2/3 ÷ 5/6, where students might incorrectly take the reciprocal of both 2/3 and 5/6."
1750,"Adds ""100"" to end of written value rather than multiplying by 100","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are converting a number from one unit to another unit that is 100 times larger. Instead of multiplying the original number by 100, they simply add ""100"" or ""00"" to the end of the written value. For example, when converting 5 grams to centigrams, a student with this misconception may write 5100 centigrams instead of 500 centigrams.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting meters to centimeters (e.g., 5 meters becomes 5100 centimeters instead of 500 centimeters)
- Converting grams to centigrams (e.g., 5 grams becomes 5100 centigrams instead of 500 centigrams)
- Converting euros to cents (e.g., 5 euros becomes 5100 cents instead of 500 cents)
- Converting units of area from square meters to square centimeters (e.g., 5 square meters becomes 5100 square centimeters instead of 50000 square centimeters)"
1751,Does not realise we can borrow from the preceding digit in a subtraction problem,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing subtraction calculations, particularly with multi-digit numbers. They may struggle to understand the concept of regrouping or borrowing, where a unit is borrowed from a preceding digit to facilitate the subtraction process. As a result, they may either stop at the point where they need to borrow or incorrectly state that the subtraction is impossible.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When subtracting a larger digit from a smaller digit in a multi-digit number, such as 43 - 27, where borrowing from the tens column is necessary.
- In word problems involving subtraction, such as ""Tom has 56 pencils and gives 32 to his friend,"" where borrowing is required to calculate the number of pencils Tom has left.
- When dealing with numbers that have multiple zeros, such as 405 - 279, where borrowing from the hundreds or tens column may be necessary.
- In situations where the minuend (the number being subtracted from) has a zero in the ones column, such as 405 - 37, requiring borrowing from the tens column."
1752,Believes the arrows for parallel lines mean equal length,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the notation used to represent parallel lines in geometry and believe that the arrows on the lines indicate that the lines are of equal length, rather than indicating that they never intersect. This can lead to incorrect assumptions about the properties of parallel lines, particularly when it comes to comparing lengths.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When comparing the lengths of two parallel lines in a diagram, a student might incorrectly conclude that the lines are the same length because they both have arrows.
- When given a problem involving parallel lines and transversals, a student might assume that the corresponding segments are equal in length because the lines have arrows, rather than understanding the concept of corresponding angles.
- When drawing diagrams involving parallel lines, a student might attempt to draw the lines as the same length, rather than understanding that the length is irrelevant to the definition of parallel lines."
1753,Believes a direct proportion graph can have a negative gradient,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of direct proportionality. They may recognize that a graph with a constant gradient represents a linear relationship but fail to distinguish between direct proportion and other linear relationships. Direct proportion implies that as one quantity increases, the other also increases at a constant rate. However, when students see a graph with a negative gradient, which represents an inverse relationship between two quantities (i.e., as one increases, the other decreases), they might still think it's a direct proportion because it's linear.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Graphing relationships - When graphing the relationship between two variables, students may mistakenly label a graph with a negative gradient as a direct proportion.
- Case 2: Word problems - In word problems involving proportions, students might misinterpret a situation where one quantity decreases as another increases, and incorrectly assume a direct proportion relationship.
- Case 3: Real-world applications - In real-world contexts, such as the relationship between price and demand, students may observe a negative correlation and mistakenly identify it as a direct proportion."
1754,Thinks two-tailed inequalities can have a constant in the middle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with two-tailed inequalities, which involve a variable being greater than or less than a certain value on both sides of a central point. Students with this misconception believe that the central point can be a constant value, rather than just the variable. For example, they might think that the inequality -2 < x - 3 < 5 can be rewritten as -5 < 3 < x + 2, which incorrectly places the constant 3 in the middle of the inequality.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When solving compound inequalities, students might incorrectly split the inequality into two separate inequalities with a constant in the middle.
* When graphing inequalities on a number line, students might misplace the constant value, thinking it represents the middle of the solution set rather than one of the endpoints.
* When working with real-world problems that involve ranges or intervals, students might misinterpret the given information and place a constant value in the middle of the range or interval."
1755,Incorrectly factorises a quadratic,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly factorise a quadratic expression, often due to a lack of understanding of the factorisation method or incorrectly identifying the factors. They may mistakenly factorise the quadratic by incorrectly grouping terms, not identifying common factors, or incorrectly applying the formula for factorisation. 

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising a quadratic expression with no common factors, e.g., x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) but incorrectly writing (x + 1)(x + 6).
- Factorising a quadratic expression with a coefficient greater than 1 for the squared term, e.g., 2x^2 + 7x + 3 = (2x + 1)(x + 3) but incorrectly writing (x + 1)(2x + 3).
- Factorising a quadratic expression with a negative coefficient for the squared term, e.g., -x^2 + 4x - 3 = -(x - 3)(x - 1) but incorrectly writing (x + 3)(-x + 1)."
1756,Thinks you need to just remove the percentage sign to convert from a percentage to a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that converting a percentage to a decimal simply involves removing the percentage sign (%). They fail to understand that the percentage sign represents a value out of 100, and removing it without adjusting the value does not accurately convert it to a decimal. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of percentages as a proportion of 100.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Converting 25% to a decimal, where students might simply write 25 instead of 0.25.
- Converting 50% to a decimal, where students might write 50 instead of 0.5.
- Converting 10% to a decimal, where students might write 10 instead of 0.1.
- Solving problems involving percentage increases or decreases, where students might incorrectly calculate the decimal equivalent of a percentage, leading to incorrect solutions."
1757,Lists outcomes rather than counts how many outcomes,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the total number of possible outcomes in a given situation, but instead of counting the outcomes, they list out each individual outcome. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of counting and basic combinatorics. Students may think that listing out each outcome is the same as counting them, or they may not realize that counting is the actual goal.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When finding the total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die and flipping a coin.
- When determining the number of ways to arrange objects in a particular order.
- When calculating the number of possible combinations of items from a larger set.

For example, if a student is asked to find the total number of outcomes when rolling a die, they may list out each possible outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) instead of simply counting the outcomes and giving the answer as 6. Similarly, if a student is asked to find the number of ways to arrange 3 objects, they may list out each possible arrangement (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA) instead of counting the arrangements and giving the answer as 6."
1758,Can not recognise all factor pairs of numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify all the possible pairs of factors of a given number. They may only be able to recognize some of the factor pairs, but not all of them. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of factors, or not fully grasping the relationship between factors and multiplication.

For example, when asked to find all the factor pairs of the number 12, students with this misconception might only be able to identify some of the pairs, such as (1, 12), (2, 6), but not others like (3, 4).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the factors of a number, students may only divide the number by small integers (e.g. 1, 2, 3) and not attempt to divide it by larger integers.
- When solving problems involving area or arrays, students may struggle to identify all the possible factor pairs of the total area or number of items.
- When simplifying fractions, students may have difficulty finding the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominator, leading to an inability to simplify the fraction correctly."
1759,Assumes decimal point can be ignored when given a decimal percentage to convert to a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a decimal percentage, such as 4.5% or 2.75%, and are asked to convert it to a fraction. They may incorrectly assume that the decimal point can be ignored, leading them to convert the percentage as if it were a whole number percentage. For example, they might convert 4.5% to 4/100 instead of 4.5/100 or 9/200.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting interest rates from decimal percentages to fractions to calculate interest or investment returns.
- When converting percentage increases or decreases in prices, such as a 2.75% increase in the price of a product.
- When converting statistical data, such as a 4.5% increase in population growth, to a fraction for further analysis.
- When solving problems involving percentage changes in geometry, such as a 3.25% increase in the area of a shape.
- When working with decimal percentages in real-world applications, such as calculating tips or discounts."
1760,"Reads the position of a number from the space between the line marked, rather than the line marked","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are reading numbers from a number line or a scale, but instead of reading the value from the line that the marker or pointer is actually on, they read the value from the space between the lines. This means that they are essentially reading the number as if it were halfway between two marked values, rather than the actual value marked on the line.

For example, if a student is reading a number from a number line marked with whole numbers, and the pointer is exactly on the line marked ""5"", they might incorrectly read the value as ""4.5"" because they are looking at the space between the lines marked ""4"" and ""5"", rather than the line marked ""5"" itself.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When reading scales on measuring instruments, like rulers or thermometers.
- When working with number lines in mathematics, particularly when identifying positions or intervals.
- When interpreting data from graphs or charts, especially if the data points are marked on a grid or scale."
1761,Does not understand what each part of a bar model represents as a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the different components of a bar model and how they relate to fractions. In a bar model, each part represents a proportion of the whole, but students may not fully grasp the concept that each section is a fraction of the total. They might not understand that the denominator represents the total number of equal parts the whole is divided into, while the numerator represents the number of parts shaded or selected.

For instance, if a bar model is divided into 8 equal parts and 3 parts are shaded, students with this misconception may not recognize that the shaded portion represents the fraction 3/8. They might also have difficulty identifying the fraction represented by the unshaded parts (5/8) or understanding how the total number of parts (denominator) affects the value of the fraction.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is given a bar model with 12 equal parts, and 4 parts are shaded. They are asked to write the fraction represented by the shaded parts, but they incorrectly write 4/10 instead of 4/12.

2. A student is shown a bar model with 6 equal parts, and 2 parts are shaded. They are asked to identify the fraction represented by the unshaded parts, but they incorrectly say it's 4/6 instead of 4/6 being the whole and 4 parts are not shaded so it should be 4/6.

3. A student is given a word problem that requires them to draw a bar model to represent a fraction. For example, ""Tom has 16 pencils, and 1/4 of them are red."" The student may struggle to divide the bar model into the correct number of parts (16) and shade the correct number of parts to represent 1/4 (4 parts)."
1762,"Thinks that when drawing the plan view, the top layer of the shape needs to be drawn in the row above ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to create a 2D representation (plan view) of a 3D shape. They mistakenly believe that the top layer of the 3D shape needs to be drawn above the main body of the shape in the 2D plan view, rather than understanding that the plan view is a bird's-eye view of the shape, where all layers are projected onto the same plane.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing a plan view of a multi-level building, students might draw the top floor above the ground floor, rather than overlaying them on the same plane.
- When representing a 3D shape with multiple stacked components, such as a tower of blocks, students may draw each block above the other, rather than showing them as a single, combined shape in the plan view.
- When creating a plan view of a 3D model with layers or levels, such as a car park or a multi-story structure, students might separate the different levels, rather than integrating them into a single 2D representation."
1763,Confuses arc and diameter,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between an arc and a diameter in a circle. An arc is a segment of the circumference of a circle, while the diameter is a line segment that passes through the center of the circle, connecting two points on the circumference. Students who hold this misconception may incorrectly assume that the length of an arc is equal to or directly proportional to the length of the diameter, or that the terms 'arc' and 'diameter' can be used interchangeably.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the circumference or area of a circle, students might mistakenly use the length of an arc instead of the diameter or radius.
- When solving problems involving the measurement of angles and arcs in a circle, students may incorrectly assume that the length of the arc is directly related to the length of the diameter.
- When interpreting diagrams or illustrations of circles, students might mislabel or confuse the arc and diameter, leading to incorrect conclusions or calculations.
- When solving problems involving circular motion or real-world applications, such as calculating the distance traveled by a wheel or a circular path, students might mistakenly apply the concept of diameter instead of arc length."
1764,Estimated when not appropriate,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly believe that estimation is only used when an exact calculation is not possible or that it is only used in certain situations, not realizing that estimation is a valuable tool to check the reasonableness of exact calculations. They may also think that estimation is not necessary when using calculators or computers, as these tools can provide exact answers. However, estimation is a crucial skill in mathematics that helps students to develop their understanding of numbers, make reasonable judgments, and detect errors in calculations.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When solving word problems, students may not use estimation to check the reasonableness of their answers, leading to unrealistic or incorrect solutions.
* When performing calculations, students may rely solely on calculators or computers without using estimation to verify the accuracy of their results.
* When working with measurements, students may not use estimation to approximate quantities or dimensions, leading to inaccurate or impractical solutions.
* When dealing with real-world applications, students may not recognize the importance of estimation in making informed decisions or solving problems that involve uncertainty or incomplete information.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A student is asked to calculate the cost of materials needed for a project and relies solely on a calculator without estimating the total cost to check for reasonableness.
* A student is solving a word problem that involves measuring the length of a room and fails to estimate the length to check if their calculated answer is reasonable.
* A student is working on a science project that involves collecting data and does not use estimation to approximate the number of data points needed to draw a reliable conclusion."
1765,"Does not understand how to answer generalised statements (eg. by testing values to check for always, sometimes, never)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend and tackle generalised statements or rules in mathematics, particularly in algebra and number. Generalised statements often involve phrases like ""always true,"" ""sometimes true,"" or ""never true,"" which require students to think critically and reason abstractly. The misconception occurs when students fail to understand that these statements can be tested and validated by substituting specific values or considering various scenarios.

For instance, a student with this misconception may encounter the following cases:

- Case 1: When presented with the statement ""The sum of two even numbers is always even,"" the student may not know how to test this statement by substituting different pairs of even numbers to verify its validity.
- Case 2: When asked to determine if the statement ""The product of two odd numbers is sometimes even"" is true, the student may not consider various examples of odd numbers to check if the statement holds true in some cases but not others.
- Case 3: When faced with the statement ""The difference between two prime numbers is never even,"" the student may not know how to test this statement by examining different pairs of prime numbers to see if there are any counterexamples.

In each of these cases, the student's inability to understand how to test and validate generalised statements leads to difficulties in assessing the truth of these statements."
1766,Thinks x^2 - a^2x is a valid form of difference of two squares,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with the formula for the difference of squares, which is (x - a)(x + a) = x^2 - a^2, but they incorrectly apply it to an expression in the form of x^2 - a^2x. They may think that since the expression contains a squared term and another term with a squared coefficient, it can be factored using the difference of squares formula. However, they fail to recognize that the correct form of the difference of squares requires the two terms to be perfect squares, not just having a squared coefficient.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying an algebraic expression, such as x^2 - 4x, and incorrectly factoring it as (x - 2)(x + ?).
- When solving quadratic equations, such as x^2 - 9x = 0, and attempting to factor it using the difference of squares formula.
- When working with algebraic identities, such as trying to prove that x^2 - a^2x is equal to (x - a)(x + a), without realizing that the correct identity requires a squared constant term, not a squared coefficient."
1767,Does not realise that a pictogram needs a title or question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that a pictogram, a type of graph that uses pictures or symbols to represent data, is complete without a title or question. They may think that the pictogram itself is sufficient to convey the information, without realizing that a title or question is necessary to provide context and help the viewer understand the purpose of the graph.

This misconception can lead students to create pictograms that are unclear or confusing, making it difficult for others to interpret the data. They may also struggle to identify the main idea or message that the pictogram is intended to convey.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When creating a pictogram to show the number of pets in the class, a student may simply draw pictures of cats and dogs without including a title, such as ""Class Pets"" or a question, such as ""What is the most popular pet in our class?""
* When representing the number of favorite foods in a survey, a student may create a pictogram with pictures of different foods, but fail to include a title, such as ""Favorite Foods"" or a question, such as ""What is the most popular food in our school?""
* When displaying the number of books read by the class, a student may create a pictogram with pictures of books, but neglect to include a title, such as ""Class Reading Habits"" or a question, such as ""How many books have we read this year?"""
1768,Believes the y-intercept of a line is the solution to its equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the y-intercept and its relationship with the equation of a line. They may believe that the y-intercept, which is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, is the only solution to the equation of the line. In other words, they think that the y-intercept is the only point that satisfies the equation, rather than understanding that it is just one point on the line.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the solution to a linear equation and they only provide the y-intercept as the answer.
- When students are graphing a line and they mark the y-intercept as the only point on the line.
- When students are solving systems of linear equations and they assume that the y-intercept of one line is the solution to the entire system.
- When students are interpreting the graph of a linear function and they believe that the y-intercept represents the maximum or minimum value of the function."
1769,Does not know how to read information off a pie chart,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to interpret the data presented in a pie chart. They may have difficulty understanding the relationship between the size of each sector and the proportion of the data it represents. This can lead to incorrect conclusions being drawn from the data.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to identify the most or least common category in a pie chart, students may incorrectly choose a sector based on its position in the chart rather than its size.
- When asked to calculate the percentage of a particular category, students may incorrectly use the number of degrees in the sector rather than the proportion of the circle.
- When comparing two or more pie charts, students may struggle to identify similarities and differences between the data sets, leading to incorrect conclusions being drawn.
- When asked to create their own pie chart from a set of data, students may incorrectly allocate proportions to each sector, resulting in an inaccurate representation of the data."
1770,Believes the proportion for a pie chart sector is 1 divided by the number of degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the number of degrees in a sector of a pie chart and the proportion of the data it represents. They believe that to find the proportion, they simply divide 1 by the number of degrees in the sector, rather than understanding that a pie chart represents 360 degrees as a whole. As a result, they incorrectly calculate the proportion, thinking it is inversely related to the number of degrees.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is asked to create a pie chart representing the favorite colors of their classmates and calculates the proportion of students who like the color blue by dividing 1 by the 90 degrees in the sector labeled 'blue'.
- A student is analyzing a pie chart showing the distribution of different types of music genres and thinks that a genre that takes up 60 degrees represents 1/60 of the total data.
- A student is tasked with interpreting a pie chart displaying the percentage of different types of transportation used in a city and incorrectly calculates the proportion of people who use bicycles by dividing 1 by the 45 degrees in the sector labeled 'bicycles'."
1771,Believes the solution of a quadratic inequality is always the interval between the roots,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to quadratic inequalities and mistakenly assume that the solution set is always the interval between the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation. They may think that if the roots of the equation are the points where the graph touches the x-axis, then the interval between these points must be where the inequality is satisfied. However, this is not always the case, as the direction of the inequality (less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to) and the coefficient of the quadratic term can affect the solution set.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When solving the inequality x^2 - 4x + 3 > 0, a student might assume the solution set is the interval between the roots (1, 3) without considering the direction of the inequality.
- When solving the inequality x^2 + 2x + 1 < 0, a student might assume there is no solution because the graph does not cross the x-axis, but not realize the inequality is satisfied when the quadratic expression is negative.
- When solving the inequality 2x^2 - 5x - 3 ≤ 0, a student might assume the solution set is only the interval between the roots, without considering the possibility of including the roots themselves in the solution set."
1772,Believes a reciprocal graph comes from a cubic equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly associate the shape of a reciprocal graph with a cubic equation, likely due to the presence of a horizontal asymptote and the graph's non-linear shape. They may incorrectly assume that the graph's complexity indicates a cubic relationship. In reality, a reciprocal graph is a distinct type of function, often of the form y = 1/x or y = k/x, where k is a constant.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When graphing functions and students are asked to identify the type of function represented by a reciprocal graph, they might incorrectly label it as cubic.
* When solving problems that involve identifying the equation of a graph, students may attempt to fit a cubic equation to a reciprocal graph, leading to incorrect solutions.
* When working with real-world applications, such as modeling population growth or chemical reactions, students may misinterpret the reciprocal relationship between variables as a cubic relationship, leading to inaccurate predictions or conclusions."
1773,Adds rather than subtracts when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the language used in worded problems, leading them to incorrectly apply addition instead of subtraction. Students may focus on the presence of certain keywords, but misinterpret their meaning or context, resulting in an incorrect operation being applied.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a worded problem states ""Tom has 15 pencils and gives 3 to his friend"", a student with this misconception may add 15 and 3 instead of subtracting 3 from 15.
- When a problem states ""There are 20 students in a class, and 5 students leave"", a student may add 20 and 5 instead of subtracting 5 from 20.
- When a problem states ""Sarah has £25 and spends £8 on a toy"", a student may add £25 and £8 instead of subtracting £8 from £25."
1774,"When multiplying a surd by an integer to write as one surd, squares the number under the surd rather than the number in front","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. When multiplying a surd by an integer, students might incorrectly think that they need to square the number under the surd (the radicand) rather than the number in front (the coefficient). 

For example, when multiplying 2 by √3, students with this misconception might write it as √(2^2 * 3) = √(4*3) = √12, rather than the correct approach. This shows a misunderstanding of the properties of surds and how they interact with integers.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Multiplying 3 by √5
- Multiplying 4 by √2
- Multiplying 5 by √7"
1775,Stops iteration too early when solving equations,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students prematurely stop the iterative process of solving equations, often resulting in incomplete or inaccurate solutions. Students may assume that a single step or a limited number of steps is sufficient to solve the equation, without verifying if the solution is correct or complete. This can lead to missed solutions, incomplete factorization, or failure to account for all possible values of variables.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. When solving quadratic equations, students may stop at the first solution and fail to consider the possibility of a second solution.
2. In equations involving multiple variables, students may solve for one variable and assume the solution is complete, neglecting to consider the values of the other variables.
3. When using iterative methods to solve equations, such as the Newton-Raphson method, students may stop the iteration process too early, resulting in an inaccurate solution.
4. In algebraic manipulations, students may fail to simplify expressions fully or neglect to check for potential errors, leading to incomplete or incorrect solutions.
5. When solving equations involving fractions or decimals, students may prematurely round or simplify, resulting in a loss of accuracy or incomplete solutions."
1776,Believes they solve mx + c = 0 by substituting in x = 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that solving a linear equation in the form of mx + c = 0 involves simply substituting x = 0 into the equation. They may think that by doing so, they are ""solving"" for x, when in fact, they are only finding the value of the constant term c. This misunderstanding demonstrates a lack of understanding of the concept of solving linear equations and the role of variables in algebraic expressions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given an equation such as 2x + 3 = 0 and they respond by substituting x = 0 to get 2(0) + 3 = 3, thinking that this is the solution to the equation.
- When students are asked to solve an equation like x - 2 = 0 and they answer x = 0, not realizing that the correct solution involves isolating the variable x.
- When students encounter an equation with a non-zero constant term, such as 3x + 2 = 0, and they insist on substituting x = 0, not understanding that this does not lead to a valid solution."
1777,Confuses the graph of 1/x with 1/x² when both are shown,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to distinguish between the graphs of two related but distinct functions: 1/x and 1/x². Both functions involve a variable in the denominator, but the key difference lies in the exponent of x. Students may incorrectly assume that the graphs of these functions are identical or very similar, possibly due to the fact that both functions have asymptotes and exhibit similar behavior in certain regions. However, the rate at which the functions approach their asymptotes and the overall shape of the graphs differ significantly. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify or sketch the graphs of these functions, which can have serious implications in various areas of mathematics, such as calculus, algebra, and problem-solving.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When graphing the functions 1/x and 1/x² on the same coordinate plane and failing to notice the distinct shapes and rates at which they approach their asymptotes.
- When solving problems that involve the comparison of the two functions, such as determining which function grows faster as x approaches a certain value.
- When working with real-world applications, such as physics or engineering problems, where the distinction between these functions is crucial for accurate modeling and analysis.
- When simplifying or manipulating expressions involving these functions, leading to incorrect algebraic manipulations or conclusions.
- When interpreting the behavior of these functions in the context of limits or calculus, where a deep understanding of their graphs is essential."
1778,Believes you subtract the number marked second from the estimated population to find the number marked first when using the capture-recapture method,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the capture-recapture method, which is used to estimate the population size of a particular species or group. In this method, a certain number of individuals are captured, marked, and released back into the population. Later, a second sample is taken, and the number of marked individuals recaptured is used to estimate the total population size.

Students who hold this misconception believe that to find the number of individuals marked in the first capture, they need to subtract the number of marked individuals recaptured (second capture) from the estimated total population size. However, this is not the correct application of the formula.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When calculating the number of individuals in the first capture, if the student is given the total population estimate and the number of marked individuals recaptured.
* In word problems where the capture-recapture method is applied to estimate population sizes, and students are asked to find the initial number of marked individuals.
* When comparing the results of different capture-recapture experiments, students may incorrectly apply this subtraction method to calculate the initial number of marked individuals.

For example, if the estimated population size is 100 and 20 marked individuals were recaptured, a student with this misconception might calculate the initial number of marked individuals as 100 - 20 = 80, which is incorrect."
1779,Does not recognise that a shape translated would not change orientation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that a shape that has been translated (moved) will change its orientation. In other words, they think that if a shape is moved from one position to another, it will also rotate or flip. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly predict the final position and orientation of a shape after it has been translated.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to describe the result of translating a shape by a certain number of units in a specific direction (e.g., ""What will happen to the shape if it is moved 3 units to the right?"").
- When students are given a diagram of a shape and asked to draw its image after a translation (e.g., ""Draw the shape after it has been moved 2 units up and 1 unit to the left"").
- When students are working with real-world problems involving translations, such as moving objects on a coordinate grid or describing the motion of an object in a game or simulation.
- When students are asked to identify the properties of a shape that remain the same after a translation (e.g., ""What stays the same about the shape after it has been moved?"").
- When students are comparing the original shape with its translated image and incorrectly assume that the orientation has changed."
1780,Thinks all dimensions given must be used when calculating the area,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that every dimension provided in a problem must be used in the calculation of area. They may fail to recognize that some dimensions are irrelevant or redundant for the specific calculation. This can lead to incorrect calculations, as students may attempt to incorporate all given dimensions into their formula, resulting in an incorrect area.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a rectangle's length, width, and diagonal are given, and the student tries to use the diagonal in the area calculation.
- When the dimensions of a 3D object are provided, and the student attempts to use the height or other irrelevant dimensions to calculate the area of the base.
- When the radius, diameter, and circumference of a circle are given, and the student tries to use the circumference in the area calculation.
- When the dimensions of a triangle, including its height, base, and hypotenuse, are provided, and the student attempts to use the hypotenuse in the area calculation.
- When a real-world problem, such as calculating the area of a room, includes irrelevant dimensions like the height of the ceiling, and the student tries to incorporate this dimension into the area calculation."
1781,Does not think we can have negative powers in standard form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of standard form, also known as scientific notation. They may understand that standard form is a way of expressing very large or very small numbers in a more manageable form, but they may not fully grasp the idea that the exponent (power) in standard form can be negative. Students with this misconception may believe that the power must always be a positive integer, and that negative powers are not allowed or are invalid.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying very small numbers, such as 0.00004, students may not consider writing it in standard form as 4 × 10^-5, instead opting for a positive power or a different notation.
- When comparing the magnitude of numbers, students may incorrectly assume that a number with a negative power is smaller than a number with a positive power, without considering the actual value of the number.
- When performing calculations involving standard form, students may avoid or incorrectly handle negative powers, leading to incorrect results or difficulties with the calculations."
1782,Does not recognise miles as a unit of length,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not familiar with or have limited exposure to the unit 'miles' as a measure of length or distance. They might only be familiar with metric units such as metres or kilometres and therefore, struggle to understand that miles serve the same purpose in the imperial system. As a result, when faced with problems or real-life situations involving miles, they might fail to recognize its significance as a unit of length.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading maps or road signs with distances marked in miles, and the student is unable to understand the scale or relate it to more familiar units.
- In word problems involving travel or distances in miles, where the student is unable to perform calculations or conversions due to a lack of understanding of the unit.
- When comparing distances or lengths in different units (e.g., miles vs. kilometres), and the student fails to recognize the relationship between the two systems.
- In situations where students are asked to estimate or measure distances in real-life scenarios, and they are unable to apply miles as a unit of measurement.
- When working with data or statistics involving distances in miles, such as analyzing distances travelled or travel times, and the student is unable to interpret the data correctly due to unfamiliarity with the unit."
1783,Confuses pyramid with prism,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty distinguishing between two types of 3D shapes: pyramids and prisms. Students may struggle to identify the key characteristics that differentiate these shapes, often mistaking one for the other due to superficial similarities. They may focus on the fact that both shapes have a base and sides, but fail to notice the distinct differences in their overall structure.

A pyramid has a single base and sides that meet at the apex (the top point), forming triangular faces. The sides of a pyramid are typically triangular and taper towards the apex. 

On the other hand, a prism has two identical bases that are parallel to each other, with rectangular sides connecting the corresponding vertices of the two bases.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are shown pictures or diagrams of pyramids and prisms from unusual angles, making it harder to distinguish between the shapes.
- When students are given real-life examples of objects that resemble pyramids or prisms, but have some features that blur the distinction between the two shapes (e.g., a building with a pyramid-like roof but a prism-like body).
- When students are asked to create or draw their own 3D shapes, and they mistakenly combine features of pyramids and prisms, creating a hybrid shape that doesn't conform to either definition."
1784,Believes a horizontal line can show a constant rate of change,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of rate of change and its graphical representation. They may believe that a horizontal line shows a constant rate of change because they associate ""constant"" with a fixed, unchanging value, which is indeed true for a horizontal line. However, they fail to understand that rate of change refers to the change in the output variable (y) with respect to the input variable (x), and a horizontal line actually represents a rate of change of zero, not a constant non-zero rate.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When interpreting graphs of linear relationships, students may mistakenly identify a horizontal line as having a constant rate of change, rather than recognizing it as a line with zero slope.
* When analyzing data, students may incorrectly conclude that a constant value over time indicates a constant rate of change, when in fact it indicates no change at all.
* When working with real-world applications, such as distance-time graphs, students may misinterpret a horizontal line as representing a constant speed, when in fact it represents an object at rest."
1785,Added the base numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with numbers that have different place values or exponents, and they incorrectly add the base numbers together. For example, when adding numbers with different powers of 10, such as 100 (10^2) and 10 (10^1), students may simply add the base numbers together (10 + 10) instead of taking into account the place value or exponent. 

This misconception can also occur when working with numbers in different units, such as adding 5 meters and 5 centimeters. In this case, students may add the base numbers together (5 + 5) without considering the difference in units.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Adding numbers with different powers of 10 (e.g., 1000 + 100)
- Adding numbers with different units (e.g., 5 meters + 5 centimeters)
- Adding numbers in scientific notation (e.g., 2 x 10^3 + 3 x 10^2)
- Adding numbers with different decimal places (e.g., 10.5 + 1.5)"
1786,Converts a fraction to a percentage by writing the numerator followed by the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of converting a fraction to a percentage. They mistakenly believe that simply writing the numerator followed by the denominator is the correct way to express a fraction as a percentage. For example, they might think that the fraction 3/4 is equal to 34% because they have written the numerator (3) followed by the denominator (4). 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When comparing fractions and percentages in real-life scenarios, like discounts or probabilities.
- When solving problems that involve converting fractions to percentages, such as finding the percentage of a quantity.
- When interpreting data presented in fractional or percentage form, like statistics or survey results.
- When working with equivalent ratios and proportions, and mistakenly applying this incorrect conversion method."
1787,"When talking about money ""taken"" in a retail context, thinks that means take-away rather than add","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the term ""taken"" in a retail context as subtracting or taking away, rather than adding or receiving. For example, if a shop ""takes"" £50 in sales, the student might think that the shop now has £50 less, rather than £50 more. This misunderstanding can stem from the everyday use of the word ""take"" meaning to remove or subtract, rather than its use in a business context where ""take"" means to receive or earn.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A shop takes £200 in sales on a particular day, and the student thinks the shop has lost £200.
- A market stall takes £50 from the sale of a product, and the student believes the stall owner now has £50 less.
- A restaurant takes £100 in tips, and the student thinks the restaurant has lost £100."
1788,Uses slant heights instead of parallel sides to find area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly use the slant heights of a trapezium instead of its parallel sides to calculate its area. They might incorrectly apply the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is (1/2) × (sum of parallel sides) × (perpendicular distance between the parallel sides), by using the lengths of the slant sides instead of the parallel sides. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a misunderstanding of the properties of trapezia.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

1. Finding the area of a trapezium with slant heights given, where students may directly use these lengths in the area formula.
2. Calculating the area of a trapezium with both parallel and slant sides labeled, where students might choose the wrong sides for the calculation.
3. Solving problems involving real-life applications of trapezia, such as the area of a roof or a building foundation, where the distinction between parallel and slant sides is crucial.
4. Determining the area of a trapezium inscribed in a circle, where the slant sides might be radii of the circle, and students might mistakenly use these radii in the area calculation."
1789,Thinks the elevation is taken from an angle to include aspects of the other side,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with 3D shapes and are asked to find the elevation of an object. They mistakenly believe that the elevation is taken from an angle, which would include aspects of the other side of the object, rather than understanding that elevation is a 2D representation of a 3D object from a specific side, usually the front, side, or top. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of elevation and how it is used to represent 3D objects in a 2D format.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to draw the elevation of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a rectangular prism, and they include features from multiple sides in their drawing.
- When students are given a 3D object and asked to identify its elevation, and they point to a diagonal or angled view of the object.
- When students are working with real-world examples, such as building plans or architectural drawings, and they fail to recognize that the elevation is a 2D representation of a specific side of the building, rather than a 3D view."
1790,Does not know the correct notation for labelling a side length,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unsure or incorrectly use the notation to label the length of a side in a geometric shape, such as a triangle, rectangle, or other polygon. In geometry, specific notations are used to label side lengths, angles, and other features of shapes. Students may misunderstand or be unfamiliar with the convention of using a specific letter or symbol to represent the length of a side, such as using ""AB"" or ""a"" to label the length of a side AB.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When students are asked to label the sides of a triangle, they might incorrectly use the same letter to label multiple sides or use a notation that does not follow the standard convention.
2. In a problem involving finding the perimeter of a rectangle, students may incorrectly label the length and width of the rectangle, leading to incorrect calculations.
3. When working with diagrams of 3D shapes, students might struggle to correctly label the lengths of edges or sides, making it difficult to calculate surface areas or volumes.
4. In a construction task, students may be asked to draw a shape with specific side lengths, but their misunderstanding of notation may lead to incorrect drawings or measurements."
1791,Does not know that vertically opposite angles are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize that vertically opposite angles, which are angles that are opposite each other when two lines intersect, have the same measure. They may believe that these angles are unrelated or have different measures, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions in geometric problems. This misconception can be due to a lack of understanding of the properties of intersecting lines and angles, or a failure to visualize and identify the relationships between angles in a diagram.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to find the measure of an angle in a diagram with intersecting lines, a student may not recognize that the vertically opposite angle has the same measure.
* When solving problems involving the properties of 2D shapes, such as triangles and quadrilaterals, students may not take into account the equality of vertically opposite angles.
* In real-world applications, such as designing buildings or bridges, students may not consider the equal measures of vertically opposite angles when calculating stresses and loads on structures.
* When working with theorems such as the angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees, or the angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360 degrees, students may not understand that vertically opposite angles are equal, leading to incorrect proofs and calculations."
1792,Has multiplied the base number and the power,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of exponentiation. When given an expression with a base number and an exponent (power), some students may think that the operation is multiplication instead of repeated multiplication of the base number by itself. For example, when faced with the expression 2^3, they may calculate it as 2 * 3 = 6 instead of 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions with exponents, such as 3^4 or 2^5.
- When solving equations involving exponents, like 2^x = 16.
- When working with exponential functions, such as y = 2^x.
- When evaluating numerical expressions, such as 4^2 + 3^2.
- When applying exponent rules, like the product of powers rule (a^m * a^n = a^(m+n))."
1793,Does not count end number when counting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count a set of objects or numbers within a specific range, but they fail to include the end number in their count. For example, if asked to count the number of numbers from 1 to 10, a student with this misconception might only count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, but not include the 10, resulting in an incorrect count of 9 instead of 10.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When counting the number of days in a week, a student might count Monday to Saturday, but not include Sunday.
- When counting the number of items in a set, such as counting blocks from 1 to 15, but not including the 15th block.
- When solving problems that involve counting within a range, such as ""How many numbers are there between 5 and 15?"" and not including 15 in the count.
- When measuring lengths or distances, such as counting the number of centimeters from 0 to 10 cm, but not including the 10 cm mark."
1794,Does not recognise that choosing 2 items at once means the first item does not get replaced in a probability question,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with probability questions that involve choosing items without replacement. In such scenarios, students may incorrectly assume that the probability of the second event is independent of the first event, not realizing that the removal of the first item affects the probability of the second item. They may calculate the probability of the second event as if the first item was replaced, leading to incorrect results.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- A box contains 5 red balls and 5 blue balls. A student is asked to find the probability of drawing two red balls consecutively without replacement. The student may incorrectly calculate the probability of drawing the second red ball as 5/10, instead of 4/9.
- A deck of cards contains 52 cards, with 4 aces. A student is asked to find the probability of drawing two aces consecutively without replacement. The student may incorrectly calculate the probability of drawing the second ace as 4/52, instead of 3/51.
- A bag contains 10 marbles, with 3 red, 3 blue, and 4 green marbles. A student is asked to find the probability of drawing two blue marbles consecutively without replacement. The student may incorrectly calculate the probability of drawing the second blue marble as 3/10, instead of 2/9."
1795,"Believes you subtract the smaller digit from the larger digit in column subtraction, regardless of position","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of column subtraction, particularly when dealing with multi-digit numbers. They believe that when subtracting one number from another, they should always subtract the smaller digit from the larger digit, regardless of the position of the digits in the column. This means that they focus solely on the individual digits being subtracted, rather than considering the place value of each digit and the overall calculation.

For example, when subtracting 47 from 93, a student with this misconception may perform the calculation as follows:

- In the tens column, they would subtract 4 from 9, which is correct (9 - 4 = 5).
- However, in the ones column, they would subtract 7 from 3, simply because 7 is larger than 3, resulting in an incorrect calculation (7 - 3 = 4, instead of 3 - 7 = -4).

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Subtracting 25 from 53: A student may incorrectly subtract 5 from 2 in the ones column.
- Subtracting 17 from 43: A student may incorrectly subtract 7 from 3 in the ones column.
- Subtracting 94 from 137: A student may incorrectly subtract 4 from 7 in the ones column and 9 from 3 in the tens column."
1796,Thinks a positive x value in a column vector means to move left rather than right,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to column vectors in mathematics, particularly in the context of geometry and transformations. They may incorrectly believe that a positive x value in a column vector indicates movement to the left, rather than to the right, on the x-axis. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of clear understanding of the coordinate system or a simple misinterpretation of the vector notation.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to describe the translation of an object using column vectors, they might state that a positive x value means moving the object left.
- When graphing vectors on a coordinate plane, students may plot the vector with the arrowhead pointing in the wrong direction, indicating a leftward movement for a positive x value.
- In problem-solving, students might calculate the new position of an object after a translation, but due to this misconception, they will arrive at an incorrect answer, showing the object moving left instead of right."
1797,Assumes the range of a set of data starts at zero,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the range of a set of data always starts from zero, rather than understanding that it is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the definition of range or a lack of experience working with datasets that have non-zero minimum values.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A student is given a dataset of exam scores ranging from 40 to 90 and calculates the range as 90, assuming it starts from 0.
- Case 2: A student is asked to find the range of a set of temperatures in a city over a week, with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 25°C. They incorrectly state the range as 25, assuming it starts from 0°C.
- Case 3: A student is working with a dataset of heights of students in their class, with heights ranging from 150cm to 180cm. They mistakenly calculate the range as 180, assuming it starts from 0cm."
1798,Believes 1 is a prime number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are first introduced to the concept of prime numbers. They may recall the definition of a prime number as a number that can only be divided by 1 and itself, but they fail to consider the additional criterion that a prime number must have exactly two distinct factors. Since 1 only has one factor, which is 1 itself, it does not meet the full definition of a prime number. However, some students might overlook this subtle detail and incorrectly believe that 1 is indeed a prime number.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to list prime numbers, they might start with 1.
- When solving problems involving prime factorization, they may incorrectly identify 1 as a prime factor.
- When determining whether a number is prime or composite, they might use 1 as an example of a prime number for comparison.
- In discussions about the properties of prime numbers, such as the distribution of prime numbers or the primality tests, they may include 1 as a prime number, leading to incorrect conclusions."
1799,"When converting fraction to ratio, thinks you just use the numerator and denominator as the numbers in the ratio ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a ratio is a simple matter of using the numerator and denominator as the numbers in the ratio, without considering the relationship between the two. For example, if a student is given the fraction 2/4 and asked to express it as a ratio, they might write 2:4, not realizing that the ratio should be simplified to 1:2. This misconception can occur when students are not fully understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the importance of simplifying fractions.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying fractions to ratios in recipe measurements (e.g. scaling down a recipe that serves 8 people to one that serves 4 people)
- When comparing proportions of different mixtures or solutions in science experiments
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios in geometry, such as finding the scale factor between two similar figures."
1800,Believes multiplying two positives gives a negative answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the rules of multiplication, specifically with regards to the signs of the numbers being multiplied. They may have a prior understanding that multiplying numbers can result in a larger value, but incorrectly assume that multiplying two positive numbers will somehow ""flip"" the result to a negative value. This misconception could stem from a lack of clear understanding of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition or an incomplete grasp of the rules governing the signs of products.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When multiplying two positive integers, such as 3 × 4, the student may answer -12.
* When solving real-world problems, such as calculating the area of a room with dimensions 5 meters by 6 meters, the student may give a negative area, -30 square meters.
* When working with word problems, like ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils each"", the student may incorrectly conclude that Tom has -12 pencils."
1801,Believes they always divide by the conversion factor when converting units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to unit conversions, particularly in the context of measurement. They may have initially learned that to convert between units, they need to divide by a conversion factor, but they overgeneralize this rule, assuming it applies to all conversions. They fail to recognize that the operation (multiplication or division) depends on the direction of the conversion. As a result, they consistently divide by the conversion factor, even when the conversion requires multiplication.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 500 grams to kilograms: A student with this misconception may divide 500 by 1000 (the conversion factor from grams to kilograms), resulting in an incorrect answer.
- Converting 5 meters to centimeters: The student may divide 5 by 100 (the conversion factor from meters to centimeters), instead of multiplying, leading to an incorrect conversion.
- Converting 2 liters to milliliters: The student may divide 2 by 1000 (the conversion factor from liters to milliliters), resulting in an incorrect answer."
1802,Adds instead of subtracts when finding the area of part of a shape,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a part of a shape, such as a shaded region, and they mistakenly add the areas of the different parts instead of subtracting the area of the unshaded region from the total area of the shape. This shows a lack of understanding of how to find the area of a composite shape by breaking it down into simpler shapes and applying the correct mathematical operations.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a shaded region inside a rectangle, students may add the area of the shaded region and the area of the unshaded region instead of subtracting the area of the unshaded region from the total area of the rectangle.
- When calculating the area of a room with a smaller room inside it, students may add the areas of both rooms instead of subtracting the area of the smaller room from the area of the larger room.
- When finding the area of a shape with a hole or a cut-out, students may add the area of the shape and the area of the hole instead of subtracting the area of the hole from the area of the shape."
1803,Believes they can divide by a variable without checking whether it could equal zero,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to algebraic expressions and equations, and they start to apply basic arithmetic operations to variables as they would with numbers. They may assume that dividing by a variable is the same as dividing by a number, without realizing that a variable can represent any value, including zero. In algebra, division by zero is undefined, and this concept is crucial in solving equations and manipulating expressions.

This misconception can lead students to cancel out variables without checking if the variable could potentially be zero, resulting in incorrect or undefined solutions. This oversight can be particularly problematic when dealing with equations, inequalities, and algebraic expressions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Simplifying the expression: 5x / x
2. Solving the equation: 2x / x = 3
3. Manipulating the inequality: 3x / (x+2) > 0
4. Finding the value of x in the equation: x^2 / x = 4
5. Simplifying the algebraic fraction: (x+2) / (x-2)"
1804,"When dividing fractions, multiplies the numerators and multiplies the denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing fractions. They may mistakenly apply the rule for multiplying fractions, which is to multiply the numerators and multiply the denominators. This is because the process of multiplying fractions is often taught before dividing fractions, and students may not fully understand the difference between the two operations.

For example, when dividing 1/2 by 1/4, students with this misconception may calculate it as:

(1 × 1) / (2 × 4) = 1/8

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying complex fractions, like 3/4 ÷ 2/5
- When solving word problems that involve dividing fractions, like sharing a pizza that is 3/4 full among 1/2 of the students in a class
- When working with algebraic expressions that involve dividing fractions, like (x/2) ÷ (3/4)
- When solving problems in real-world contexts, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe that requires dividing fractions of cups or teaspoons."
1805,Does not realise that subtracting a negative is the same as adding it's additive inverse,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of subtracting a negative number. They may think that subtracting a negative number is the same as subtracting a positive number, rather than understanding that subtracting a negative is equivalent to adding its positive counterpart (additive inverse). For example, they may not recognize that -3 - (-4) is the same as -3 + 4.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When simplifying expressions, e.g., 5 - (-2)
* When solving equations, e.g., x - (-3) = 7
* When working with word problems involving temperatures, e.g., ""The temperature dropped by -5°C, then rose by 3°C""
* When dealing with financial transactions, e.g., ""I lost £10, then I had a debt of £-5 cancelled""
* When graphing functions, e.g., understanding how the graph of y = x - (-2) relates to the graph of y = x + 2"
1806,Only recognises the negative form of a quadratic graph,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are only familiar with the standard form of a quadratic equation, which is often represented as a parabola that opens upwards (e.g. y = x^2) or more commonly as a parabola that opens downwards (e.g. y = -x^2), resulting in a 'negative' or 'inverted' U shape. As a result, they may struggle to recognize or even believe that a parabola can open upwards and still be a quadratic graph.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When graphing a quadratic equation in the form y = ax^2, students may assume that 'a' must be negative for the graph to be quadratic, and may not consider the possibility of 'a' being positive.
- When shown a graph of a parabola that opens upwards, students may mistakenly identify it as a different type of function, such as an exponential or linear function.
- When solving quadratic equations, students may incorrectly assume that the solutions will always result in a parabola that opens downwards, and may be confused by solutions that produce an upward-opening parabola."
1807,"When multiplying mixed numbers, forgets to multiply the fraction","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with mixed numbers, which are a combination of a whole number and a fraction. When multiplying two mixed numbers, students often remember to multiply the whole numbers together, but they may forget to multiply the fractions as well. As a result, they may only multiply the whole numbers and either ignore the fractions or add them incorrectly.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Multiplying two mixed numbers with the same denominator, e.g., 2 1/4 × 3 1/4. The student might multiply 2 and 3, but forget to multiply 1/4 × 1/4.
- Case 2: Multiplying two mixed numbers with different denominators, e.g., 2 1/4 × 3 1/6. The student might multiply 2 and 3, but struggle with multiplying 1/4 × 1/6.
- Case 3: Multiplying a mixed number by a whole number, e.g., 2 1/4 × 4. The student might multiply 2 by 4, but forget to multiply 1/4 by 4."
1808,does not realise that the product of prime factors will also be a factor of the original number ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the concept of prime factors but fail to connect it with the factors of the original number. They may be able to identify and list the prime factors of a given number, but they don't recognize that the product of these prime factors, in any combination, will also be a factor of the original number. 

For example, if the original number is 12 and its prime factors are 2 and 3, students with this misconception may not realize that the products of these prime factors, such as 2*2=4, 2*3=6, are also factors of 12. 

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Factorizing numbers and identifying all the factors.
- Simplifying fractions by cancelling common factors.
- Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) or the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
- Solving problems involving the factor theorem in algebra."
1809,Rounds too little when estimating,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students tend to round numbers too much or to a larger place value than necessary, often resulting in an estimate that is too far from the actual value. This can lead to inaccurate calculations and conclusions. For instance, when estimating the sum of 43 and 27, a student might round 43 to 40 and 27 to 20 or even 30 to 0, resulting in an estimated sum of 40 + 20 = 60 or 40 + 0 = 40, which is far from the actual sum of 70.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Estimating the cost of items: A student might round the cost of items to the nearest ten or hundred, resulting in an inaccurate estimate of the total cost.
2. Measuring lengths: Rounding measurements to the nearest meter or foot instead of the nearest centimeter or inch can lead to incorrect calculations.
3. Calculating areas and volumes: Rounding dimensions to larger place values can result in inaccurate calculations of areas and volumes.
4. Real-world applications: Estimating quantities, such as the number of people attending an event or the amount of food needed, can be affected by rounding too little."
1810,Thinks x = 1 at the x axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any point on the x-axis has a value of x = 1. They fail to understand that the x-axis represents a range of values for x, not just the value of 1. In the coordinate plane, the x-axis is the horizontal axis where y = 0, and x can take any value, positive, negative, or zero. 

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When plotting points on a graph, students might always write x = 1 for any point that lies on the x-axis, regardless of its actual x-coordinate.
- When solving equations, students may assume that if a point lies on the x-axis, then the value of x is always 1, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When interpreting the x-intercept of a graph, students may think that it always occurs at x = 1, rather than understanding that it can occur at any value of x where the graph crosses the x-axis."
1811,Believes that the compensation strategy for the multiplication of 2 numbers can only be used one way round.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the compensation strategy in multiplication, which involves breaking down a multiplication problem into simpler components by adding or subtracting a certain number to make the calculation easier. For instance, when multiplying 7 x 19, a student might use the compensation strategy by breaking it down into (7 x 20) - (7 x 1) to make the calculation simpler.

However, students with this misconception believe that this strategy can only be applied in one specific way, and they fail to recognize that the strategy can be applied in multiple ways depending on the numbers involved. They might think that the strategy only works when you adjust the numbers in a particular order or by a specific amount.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When multiplying 4 x 27, a student might think the compensation strategy can only be applied as (4 x 25) + (4 x 2) and not as (4 x 30) - (4 x 3).
- When multiplying 9 x 15, a student might believe the strategy can only be used as (9 x 10) + (9 x 5) and not as (9 x 20) - (9 x 5).
- When multiplying 6 x 23, a student might think the compensation strategy can only be applied as (6 x 20) + (6 x 3) and not as (6 x 25) - (6 x 2)."
1812,"When multiplying fractions, adds the denominators and multiplies the numerators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions. They may think that multiplying fractions involves adding the denominators (the numbers at the bottom) together, while multiplying the numerators (the numbers at the top) together. For example, when multiplying 1/2 and 1/3, students with this misconception might think the result is (1 x 1) / (2 + 3) = 1/5.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying two fractions with different denominators, e.g., 2/3 × 3/4
- When multiplying a fraction by a mixed number, e.g., 2/3 × 2 1/2
- When solving problems involving the area of a rectangle with fractional dimensions, e.g., finding the area of a rectangle with length 1/2 and width 3/4
- When multiplying fractions in algebraic expressions, e.g., (1/2)x × (2/3)x"
1813,Estimates the length of diagonal lines rather than working out based on horizontal and vertical measurements,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the length of a diagonal line in a geometric shape, such as a rectangle or a right-angled triangle. Instead of using the horizontal and vertical measurements to calculate the length of the diagonal, students may simply estimate the length based on how long it looks. This can lead to inaccurate answers, as the actual length of the diagonal may be longer or shorter than the estimated length.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When finding the length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem, students may estimate the length instead of using the formula a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
* When calculating the length of a diagonal of a rectangle, students may estimate the length instead of using the formula √(horizontal^2 + vertical^2).
* When solving problems involving the lengths of diagonals in real-world applications, such as building design or construction, students may rely on estimates rather than precise calculations.
* When working with scale drawings or diagrams, students may estimate the lengths of diagonals instead of using proportional reasoning to calculate the actual lengths."
1814,Confusion over whether multiplication or division is the correct way to solve the problem.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unsure whether to use multiplication or division to solve a problem, often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the operations or the context of the problem. This confusion can lead to incorrect calculations and answers.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with word problems that involve scaling or resizing, such as ""If I have 3 groups of 4 pencils, how many pencils do I have in total?"" (multiplication) versus ""If I have 12 pencils and I want to put them into groups of 4, how many groups can I make?"" (division).
- When working with fractions or ratios, such as ""If I have 1/2 of a pizza and I want to share it equally among 4 friends, how much pizza will each friend get?"" (division) versus ""If I have 1/2 of a pizza and I want to make 4 identical smaller pizzas, how much pizza will I need in total?"" (multiplication).
- When solving problems involving measurement, such as ""If I have 3 meters of string and I want to cut it into 4 equal pieces, how long will each piece be?"" (division) versus ""If I have 3 meters of string and I want to make 4 identical loops, how much string will I need in total?"" (multiplication)."
1815,"When given the perimeter of a regular polygon, subtracts instead of divides to find each side length","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the length of each side of a regular polygon, given its perimeter. They incorrectly assume that to find the length of one side, they need to subtract the number of sides from the perimeter, rather than dividing the perimeter by the number of sides. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the perimeter of a polygon and the number of its sides.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Finding the side length of a regular hexagon with a perimeter of 36 cm, where the student may subtract 6 (number of sides) from 36, resulting in an incorrect side length of 30 cm.
- Calculating the side length of a regular octagon with a perimeter of 64 cm, where the student may subtract 8 (number of sides) from 64, resulting in an incorrect side length of 56 cm.
- Determining the side length of a regular triangle with a perimeter of 21 cm, where the student may subtract 3 (number of sides) from 21, resulting in an incorrect side length of 18 cm."
1816,"Believes the probability on all branches travelling in the same direction on a tree diagram are the same, despite changing events","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that in a tree diagram, the probabilities of all branches that point in the same direction are equal. They fail to recognize that each branch represents a unique event or outcome, and the probabilities associated with each branch can be different, even if they are pointing in the same direction. This misunderstanding leads students to incorrectly assign equal probabilities to all branches pointing in the same direction, rather than carefully considering the specific events and their corresponding probabilities.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A tree diagram representing the outcomes of flipping two coins, where students assume that the probability of getting heads on the second flip is the same as the first flip, regardless of the outcome of the first flip.
- A tree diagram showing the possible outcomes of drawing two cards from a deck, where students believe that the probability of drawing a certain card on the second draw is the same as the first draw, without considering the cards that have already been removed from the deck.
- A tree diagram illustrating the outcomes of rolling two dice, where students assume that the probability of rolling a certain number on the second die is the same as the first die, without taking into account the specific numbers that have already been rolled."
1817,Rounds every number down when estimating,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to estimate or round numbers to a certain degree of accuracy, such as to the nearest ten, hundred, or thousand. Students with this misconception tend to believe that rounding always involves reducing the number to the lower value, regardless of the digit being rounded. For instance, when asked to round 43 to the nearest ten, they would incorrectly round it down to 40, and when asked to round 67 to the nearest ten, they would also incorrectly round it down to 60, instead of considering the actual rules of rounding.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When dealing with measurements: If a pencil is 17 cm long and students need to estimate its length to the nearest ten, they might round it down to 10 cm instead of 20 cm.
- When working with data: If a dataset includes the number 23 and students are asked to estimate the value to the nearest ten, they might incorrectly round it down to 20.
- When solving math problems: In a calculation involving the number 49, students might be asked to estimate the value to the nearest ten, and they would incorrectly round it down to 40.
- When reading scales: If a scale shows a reading of 85 kg and students are asked to estimate the weight to the nearest ten, they might incorrectly round it down to 80 kg."
1818,Thinks you can find missing values in a given table by treating the row as linear and adding on the difference between the first two values given.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a table with some missing values and are asked to find those values. They mistakenly assume that the relationship between the values in each row is always linear, meaning that the difference between consecutive values is constant. As a result, they attempt to find the missing values by adding the difference between the first two values to the previous value, assuming that this pattern will continue. However, this approach fails to consider other possible relationships between the values, such as non-linear or non-constant differences.

This misconception can occur in various cases, including:

- When dealing with non-linear sequences, such as quadratic or exponential relationships, where the difference between consecutive values is not constant.
- When working with real-world data that may not follow a linear pattern, such as population growth or temperature changes.
- When analyzing data with varying rates of change, such as acceleration or deceleration.
- When encountering tables with irregularly spaced values or non-uniform intervals.
- When faced with tables that have multiple patterns or relationships, making it difficult to identify a single, consistent difference between values."
1819,Confuses order of sides in a trigonometric ratio,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap or misremember the order of sides in a trigonometric ratio, such as sine, cosine, or tangent. In trigonometry, each ratio has a specific order of sides, which is crucial for solving problems correctly. For example, the sine ratio is opposite side over hypotenuse, while the cosine ratio is adjacent side over hypotenuse. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly use the opposite side over adjacent side for sine or vice versa.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Using the wrong side lengths when solving triangle problems, leading to incorrect calculations and answers.
- Failing to recognize that the order of sides is crucial in trigonometric ratios and neglecting to check the correct order.
- Incorrectly applying trigonometric identities, such as the Pythagorean identity, due to a misunderstanding of the order of sides.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is given a right triangle with labeled side lengths and asked to find the sine of a specific angle. However, they mistakenly use the adjacent side over hypotenuse instead of the opposite side over hypotenuse.
- Case 2: A student is solving a word problem involving a right triangle and needs to use the cosine ratio to find an unknown side length. However, they incorrectly uses the opposite side over adjacent side instead of the adjacent side over hypotenuse.
- Case 3: A student is simplifying a trigonometric expression and needs to apply the Pythagorean identity. However, due to a misunderstanding of the order of sides, they incorrectly substitutes the wrong side lengths into the identity."
1820,"Uses the denominator when converting from fractions to ratio, rather than numerator.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a fraction into a ratio. In a fraction, the numerator represents the number of equal parts being considered, and the denominator represents the total number of parts. However, when converting a fraction to a ratio, students may incorrectly use the denominator as the first number in the ratio, rather than the numerator.

For example, when converting the fraction 2/5 into a ratio, students with this misconception may write the ratio as 5:2 instead of the correct ratio 2:5. This is because they are incorrectly using the denominator (5) as the first number in the ratio, rather than the numerator (2).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When comparing the number of boys to girls in a class, where the fraction of boys is 3/7, and students write the ratio as 7:3 instead of 3:7.
- When writing a recipe that requires a fraction of ingredients, such as 1/4 cup of sugar, and students convert it to a ratio of 4:1 instead of 1:4.
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios, where students may incorrectly use the denominator to find the missing value in a proportion."
1821,"When finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence, believes that the coefficient of n squared is the second difference","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are trying to find the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence. A quadratic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is not constant, but the difference between the differences (the second difference) is constant. Students with this misconception believe that the coefficient of n squared in the nth term rule is equal to the second difference of the sequence. This is not accurate, as the relationship between the second difference and the coefficient of n squared is more complex.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When finding the nth term rule for the sequence 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, ... , and the student thinks the coefficient of n squared is 3, which is the second difference of the sequence.
- When analyzing the sequence 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... , and the student incorrectly assumes the coefficient of n squared is 2, which is the second difference.
- When working with a sequence such as 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ... , and the student mistakenly believes the coefficient of n squared is the second difference of 3."
1822,Thinks they multiply the numerator and denominator together to convert a fraction to a percentage ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the process of converting a fraction to a percentage. They mistakenly believe that multiplying the numerator and denominator together will give them the desired percentage. This may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between fractions, decimals, and percentages, or a misinterpretation of the concept of equivalent ratios.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When converting a simple fraction like 1/2 to a percentage, a student may multiply 1 and 2 together to get 2, thinking that the answer is 2% instead of 50%.
* When working with more complex fractions like 3/4, a student may multiply 3 and 4 together to get 12, thinking that the answer is 12% instead of 75%.
* In word problems, such as finding the percentage of students who scored above a certain grade in a test, a student may apply this misconception and arrive at an incorrect answer. For example, if 3/5 of the students scored above a certain grade, a student may multiply 3 and 5 together to get 15, thinking that 15% of students scored above that grade instead of the correct percentage."
1823,"When there are two modes, finds the mean of these values and gives that as the mode","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with a dataset that has two modes, also known as bimodal data. In such cases, they might incorrectly assume that they can simply find the mean of the two modes and report that value as the mode. This shows a misunderstanding of the concept of mode, which is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. By finding the mean of the two modes, students are essentially creating a new value that may not even exist in the dataset, rather than identifying the actual modes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is analyzing the scores of a class test and finds that both 75 and 85 appear with the same highest frequency. They might calculate the mean of these two values, (75 + 85) / 2 = 80, and report 80 as the mode, even though 80 may not appear at all in the dataset.

- Case 2: A student is working with a dataset of favorite colors in a class and finds that both blue and green are the most popular colors, each chosen by 10 students. They might incorrectly find the ""mean"" of these two colors, which doesn't make sense in this context, or try to find a midpoint between the two, rather than reporting both blue and green as modes.

- Case 3: A student is analyzing the number of hours spent watching TV per day by a group of people and finds that both 2 hours and 4 hours are the most common values. They might calculate the mean of these two values, (2 + 4) / 2 = 3, and report 3 hours as the mode, even though 3 hours may not be a value that appears frequently in the dataset."
1824,Counts the starting number when counting backwards,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to count backwards from a certain number by a specific amount, but they include the starting number in their count. This means they count the starting number as one of the numbers they are counting back, rather than starting to count back from the number after it.

For example:

* When asked to count back 5 numbers from 10, a student with this misconception may count: 10 (as 1), 9 (as 2), 8 (as 3), 7 (as 4), 6 (as 5), and then stop, giving an incorrect answer of 6 instead of 5.
* When asked to count back 3 numbers from 7, a student may count: 7 (as 1), 6 (as 2), 5 (as 3), and give an incorrect answer of 5 instead of 4.
* When asked to subtract 4 from 9 by counting back, a student may start with 9 and count back: 9 (as 1), 8 (as 2), 7 (as 3), 6 (as 4), and give an incorrect answer of 6 instead of 5.

This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of counting backwards and can lead to errors in subtraction and other math calculations."
1825,Does not fully simplify fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not fully reduce fractions to their simplest form. A fraction is in its simplest form when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1. Students with this misconception may stop simplifying a fraction once they have cancelled out some common factors, but not all of them.

For example, when simplifying the fraction 12/18, a student with this misconception may cancel out a factor of 2 to get 6/9, but fail to recognize that both 6 and 9 have a common factor of 3. As a result, they may incorrectly conclude that 6/9 is the simplest form of the fraction.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Simplifying fractions with large numbers: When dealing with fractions that have large numerators and denominators, students may become overwhelmed and stop simplifying too soon.
- Working with equivalent ratios: When working with equivalent ratios, students may not fully simplify fractions, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- Adding or subtracting fractions: When adding or subtracting fractions, students may not fully simplify the resulting fraction, leading to incorrect answers.
- Comparing fractions: When comparing fractions, students may not fully simplify fractions, making it difficult to compare them accurately."
1826,Believes the solution of a quadratic is its turning point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the solution to a quadratic equation is the vertex or turning point of the parabola, rather than the x-intercepts. They may believe that finding the turning point is the ultimate goal of solving a quadratic equation, not realizing that the turning point is just a characteristic of the parabola, while the solutions are the x-values where the parabola intersects the x-axis.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When graphing quadratic functions and identifying key features, students might incorrectly label the vertex as the ""solution"" of the equation.
* When solving quadratic equations using methods like completing the square or the quadratic formula, students might stop at finding the vertex form of the equation and think that the vertex is the final answer.
* When faced with quadratic equations that have no real solutions (i.e., the parabola does not intersect the x-axis), students might mistakenly think that the turning point is the solution, rather than recognizing that there are no real solutions.
* When working with quadratic equations in context, such as projectile motion or optimization problems, students might focus on finding the vertex (e.g., the maximum or minimum point) and think that this is the solution to the problem, rather than finding the x-intercepts or other relevant information."
1827,Believes the upper bound of an interval in a grouped frequency table is equivalent to the group width of the interval,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the upper bound of an interval in a grouped frequency table is the same as the group width. They may believe that the upper bound is simply the range of values within the group, rather than the actual upper limit of the interval. This can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of the data.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the midpoint of an interval: A student may use the group width as the upper bound, resulting in an incorrect midpoint.
- When drawing a histogram: A student may use the group width as the upper bound, leading to incorrect bar widths and a distorted representation of the data.
- When calculating the mean from a grouped frequency table: A student may use the group width as the upper bound, resulting in incorrect calculations and an inaccurate mean.
- When determining the modal group: A student may use the group width as the upper bound, leading to incorrect identification of the modal group."
1828,Does not understand inequality notation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of inequality notation, which is used to represent relationships between numbers or expressions that are not equal. Inequality notation includes symbols such as < (less than), > (greater than), ≤ (less than or equal to), ≥ (greater than or equal to), and ≠ (not equal to). Students may have difficulty understanding the direction of the inequality symbol, the inclusion or exclusion of the end points, or the concept of a range of values rather than a single solution.

This misconception can lead to incorrect interpretations and applications of inequalities in various mathematical contexts, such as solving linear inequalities, graphing inequalities on a number line, or working with compound inequalities.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student writes the solution to the inequality 2x > 6 as x < 3, incorrectly flipping the direction of the inequality symbol.
- A student graphing the inequality x ≥ 2 on a number line fails to include the endpoint 2, incorrectly treating it as an open interval.
- A student solving the inequality -3 ≤ x < 5 writes the solution as x < -3 or x ≥ 5, incorrectly interpreting the direction of the inequality and the inclusion of the endpoints."
1829,Believes they must change the direction of the inequality when dividing through by a positive number.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the rule of changing the direction of the inequality when multiplying or dividing by a negative number. They might overgeneralize this rule and believe that the direction of the inequality must be changed whenever they divide by any number, including positive numbers. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect solutions when working with inequalities.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving linear inequalities, such as 4x > 12, and dividing both sides by a positive number (e.g., 4).
- When working with algebraic expressions involving inequalities and fractions, where students might divide by a positive denominator to simplify the expression.
- When solving problems involving ratios or proportions with inequalities, where students might divide by a positive value to compare the ratios."
1830,Thinks area of a circle = radius x pi ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the formula for the area of a circle. They may recall that the formula involves the radius and pi, but incorrectly believe that the area is equal to the radius multiplied by pi. This may be due to a misremembered or misinterpreted formula, or a lack of understanding of the relationship between the radius and the area of a circle.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When students are asked to find the area of a circle with a given radius, and they respond with an answer that is simply the radius multiplied by pi.
* When students are comparing the areas of different circles and assume that the circle with the larger radius will have an area that is proportionally larger by a factor of pi.
* When students are solving problems involving the area of a circle and consistently produce answers that are smaller than the actual area, due to the incorrect multiplication."
1831,Does not know the properties of a cylinder,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify or recall the key characteristics and attributes of a cylinder, a fundamental three-dimensional shape in geometry. A cylinder is often confused with other shapes, or its properties are misunderstood, leading to errors in calculations, visualizations, and problem-solving. Students may struggle to recognize that a cylinder has two parallel and circular bases connected by a curved lateral surface, and that it has a fixed height and radius.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Difficulty calculating the volume or surface area of a cylinder due to incorrect formulas or misunderstanding of the shape's dimensions.
* Inability to recognize or create nets of cylinders, which can hinder understanding of the shape's structure and properties.
* Confusion between cylinders and other shapes, such as cones or prisms, leading to incorrect assumptions or calculations.
* Struggles with real-world applications, such as designing or calculating the volume of containers, pipes, or other cylindrical objects.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A student is asked to calculate the volume of a cylindrical water tank, but uses the formula for a rectangular prism instead.
* Case 2: A student is tasked with creating a net of a cylinder, but draws a cone instead, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the shape's properties.
* Case 3: A student is asked to find the surface area of a cylindrical pipe, but forgets to include the areas of the two circular bases."
1832,Confuses linear and reciprocal graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between linear and reciprocal graphs, often leading to incorrect identification and interpretation of the graphs. Students may mistakenly identify a reciprocal graph as a linear graph or vice versa, due to a lack of understanding of the distinct characteristics of each type of graph. 

In the case of linear graphs, students may recognize the straight-line pattern but fail to recognize that reciprocal graphs, although appearing as a curve, also have a specific pattern where y is inversely proportional to x.

This misconception can occur in the following short cases:

- When graphing simple equations, such as y = 1/x, students may incorrectly plot the points and draw a straight line instead of a curve, showing a lack of understanding of the relationship between x and y in a reciprocal graph.
- When analyzing real-world data, such as the relationship between the cost of goods and the number of items purchased, students may misinterpret the graph and assume a linear relationship when in fact it's a reciprocal one.
- When solving algebraic equations, such as x = 1/y, students may mistakenly graph the equation as a straight line, leading to incorrect solutions and a lack of understanding of the underlying relationship between the variables."
1833,"When drawing a histogram, thinks you plot frequency on the horizontal axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that in a histogram, the frequency or the number of occurrences of a data value should be plotted on the horizontal axis. They might think that the horizontal axis is used to show the number of times each value appears in the data set, while the vertical axis represents the actual data values.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When students are given a set of data and asked to create a histogram to represent the distribution of scores in a test. They might plot the frequency of each score on the horizontal axis and the score values on the vertical axis.
- When analyzing the number of hours spent watching TV per day, students might plot the number of people watching TV for a certain number of hours on the horizontal axis and the hours on the vertical axis.
- When creating a histogram to show the distribution of heights of students in a class, students might plot the number of students at each height on the horizontal axis and the height values on the vertical axis."
1834,Confuses an equation with an expression,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between an equation, which is a statement that expresses the equality of two mathematical expressions, and an expression, which is a collection of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations combined but not equal to anything. Students may think that an expression is an equation because it has numbers and variables, or they may believe an equation is just an expression because it includes variables and operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions, students may add an equals sign and a random number at the end.
- When solving equations, students may ignore the equals sign and treat the equation as a single expression to simplify.
- When presented with an expression such as 2x + 3, students may assume it needs to be solved like an equation and add an equals sign.
- When given an equation such as x + 2 = 5, students may try to simplify it like an expression by combining the x and 2 without considering the relationship to the number 5 on the other side of the equals sign."
1835,When finding the area of a parallelogram finds base x perpendicular height but divides the answer by 2 ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the formula for the area of a parallelogram with that of a triangle. They correctly identify the need to multiply the base by the perpendicular height, but mistakenly believe that the result should be halved, as is the case when finding the area of a triangle. This error indicates a lack of understanding of the fundamental difference between the two shapes and their respective area formulas.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When a student is asked to find the area of a parallelogram with a base of 5cm and a perpendicular height of 4cm, they may write: Area = (base x height) / 2 = (5 x 4) / 2 = 10cm².
2. In a problem involving a parallelogram with a base of 8m and a perpendicular height of 6m, a student may calculate the area as: Area = (base x height) / 2 = (8 x 6) / 2 = 24m².
3. When finding the area of a parallelogram with a base of 10cm and a perpendicular height of 9cm, a student may mistakenly write: Area = (base x height) / 2 = (10 x 9) / 2 = 45cm²."
1836,Believes lines of symmetry must be vertical or horizontal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have limited exposure to examples of lines of symmetry and mistakenly believe that lines of symmetry can only be vertical (up and down) or horizontal (left to right). They may struggle to identify lines of symmetry that are diagonal or at an angle, as they don't fit their preconceived notion of what a line of symmetry should look like.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify lines of symmetry in shapes that have diagonal lines of symmetry, such as a rhombus or a kite.
* When students are given a shape with a line of symmetry that is at an angle, such as a parallelogram or a trapezoid.
* When students are asked to create their own shapes with lines of symmetry and they only produce shapes with vertical or horizontal lines of symmetry.
* When students are solving problems involving reflection symmetry and they assume that the line of symmetry must be vertical or horizontal, leading to incorrect solutions."
1837,Names one of the faces of a 3D shape rather than the 3D shape name,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify a three-dimensional (3D) shape by the name of one of its two-dimensional (2D) faces, rather than using the correct name of the 3D shape itself. For example, a student may refer to a cube as a ""square"" because they are focusing on one of the square faces of the cube, rather than recognizing it as a 3D shape.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are first introduced to 3D shapes and are struggling to differentiate between the 2D faces and the overall 3D shape.
- When students are asked to identify and name various 3D shapes, such as in a geometry lesson or activity.
- When students are working with real-world objects that are 3D shapes, such as building blocks or puzzles, and they mistakenly focus on the individual faces rather than the overall shape.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is shown a picture of a cube and is asked to name the shape. They respond by saying ""square"" because they are focusing on one of the square faces.
- A student is building with blocks and creates a 3D rectangular prism, but refers to it as a ""rectangle"" because they are focusing on one of the rectangular faces.
- A student is asked to identify the 3D shape of a pyramid, but responds by saying ""triangle"" because they are focusing on one of the triangular faces."
1838,"Confuses the roles of initial capture, recapture, and total population in the capture-recapture method","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the distinct roles of initial capture, recapture, and total population in the capture-recapture method, which is used to estimate population sizes. They may incorrectly assume that the number of recaptured individuals represents the total population or vice versa, or that the initial capture is the actual population size.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When calculating the total population, students might use the initial capture number as the total population, ignoring the recapture data.
- Case 2: When calculating the population estimate, students might incorrectly use the recapture number as the numerator or denominator in the formula.
- Case 3: Students might assume that the initial capture represents the entire population, failing to account for individuals not captured during the initial sampling.
- Case 4: When comparing the results of multiple capture-recapture experiments, students might misinterpret differences in initial capture or recapture numbers as changes in the total population.
- Case 5: When applying the capture-recapture method to real-world scenarios, students might misidentify the initial capture or recapture numbers, leading to incorrect conclusions about population sizes."
1839,Does not know how to use a bar model to write division facts,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to visualize and apply the concept of a bar model to represent division facts. In a bar model, students are supposed to divide a certain quantity (represented by a bar) into equal groups or parts, which is a fundamental concept of division. However, students with this misconception may struggle to identify the number of groups, the number of items in each group, or the relationship between the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder.

They may have difficulty drawing the correct bar model, using the model to identify the division fact, or interpreting the results. This can lead to incorrect answers, incomplete solutions, or a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concept.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to write a division fact for a given scenario, such as ""Tom has 18 pencils and wants to put them into bags of 3 pencils each. How many bags can he make?"" and the student is unable to draw a bar model to represent the problem.
- When given a division problem, such as 24 ÷ 4, and the student is unable to use a bar model to visualize the groups and find the quotient.
- When solving a word problem that requires the use of a bar model to represent the division of a quantity, such as ""A bookshelf has 12 books, and they need to be packed into boxes of 2 books each. How many boxes are needed?"" and the student struggles to apply the bar model concept."
1840,Thinks the fraction button on a calculator converts fractions to decimals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the fraction button on a calculator can be used to directly convert any fraction to a decimal. They might think that by simply entering the numerator and denominator and pressing the fraction button, the calculator will automatically display the decimal equivalent. However, the fraction button on most calculators is actually used to enter fractions in their simplest form, not to convert them to decimals. 

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying fractions with unlike denominators and trying to convert the result to a decimal.
- When performing calculations involving mixed numbers and improper fractions and attempting to find the decimal equivalent.
- When solving algebraic equations involving fractions and trying to express the solution in decimal form.
- When working with real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, and needing to convert fractional quantities to decimal equivalents."
1841,Thinks the number of wholes in a mixed number represents the tens from the numerator of an improper fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions. They mistakenly believe that the whole number part of a mixed number directly represents the tens digit of the numerator in an improper fraction. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conversions.

For example, when converting the mixed number 3 4/5 to an improper fraction, students with this misconception might think the 3 represents 30 in the numerator, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Converting a mixed number to an improper fraction, such as 2 3/4 to an improper fraction.
* Adding or subtracting mixed numbers and improper fractions, like 2 1/2 + 3/4.
* Simplifying mixed numbers and improper fractions, such as 5 2/8.
* Word problems involving mixed numbers and improper fractions, like ""Tom has 3 1/2 bags of apples. If he gives 1/4 bag to his friend, how many bags does Tom have left?"""
1842,Confuses the number of regions in a Venn diagram as the total number of entries in the diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number of distinct regions in a Venn diagram represents the total number of entries or elements in the diagram. In reality, each region in a Venn diagram can contain any number of elements, including zero. The number of regions is determined by the number of overlapping sets and the way they intersect, whereas the total number of entries depends on the actual number of elements in each region.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- A Venn diagram showing two overlapping sets, where students might think that the three regions (the two non-overlapping regions and the overlapping region) represent only three entries, when in fact each region can contain multiple elements.
- A Venn diagram with three overlapping sets, where students might assume that the seven regions represent only seven entries, without considering that each region can have multiple elements.
- A problem that asks students to determine the total number of elements in a Venn diagram, where students might incorrectly count the number of regions instead of the actual number of elements in each region."
1843,"When using interpolation to estimate frequency that is above a certain value, believes they can add the estimated frequency up to that value in its class, rather than the estimated frequency after it","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with grouped data, particularly in histograms or frequency tables, and are asked to estimate the frequency of values above a certain point using interpolation. They mistakenly believe that to find the total frequency above a specific value, they should add the estimated frequency up to that value within its class, rather than considering the estimated frequency in the classes that come after it. This error indicates a misunderstanding of how interpolation is used to estimate frequencies within grouped data and how these estimates should be applied to solve problems.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Estimating the number of students who scored above a certain grade in a test based on a histogram of the scores.
- Calculating the number of people with incomes above a certain threshold from a grouped frequency table of income ranges.
- Determining the number of days with temperatures above a certain level based on a histogram of daily temperatures."
1844,Uses length scale factor for area without squaring ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the scale factor for length directly applies to the scale factor for area. They may assume that if a shape is enlarged or reduced by a certain scale factor, the area will also change by that same scale factor. However, when scaling a two-dimensional shape, the area actually changes by the square of the scale factor, not the scale factor itself. This is because area is a two-dimensional quantity that depends on the square of the linear dimensions.

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- Enlarging a photograph: A student might think that if they enlarge a photo by a factor of 3, the area of the photo will also increase by a factor of 3, when in fact it will increase by a factor of 3^2 = 9.
- Scaling a room design: When designing a room, a student might assume that doubling the length of the walls will double the area of the room, when in fact it will quadruple the area.
- Calculating the area of similar figures: Students might mistakenly apply the length scale factor to find the area of similar figures, such as two similar triangles or circles, without squaring the scale factor."
1845,"When multiplying involving a multiple of 10, just multiplies the digits and ignores the zeros ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying numbers involving multiples of 10. They tend to focus solely on the non-zero digits and ignore the zeros, failing to recognize the place value and the effect of the zeros on the product. As a result, they incorrectly multiply only the non-zero digits, disregarding the zeros, which leads to an inaccurate product.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- 40 × 5: Students may multiply 4 and 5, resulting in 20, instead of the correct answer, 200.
- 300 × 2: Students may multiply 3 and 2, resulting in 6, instead of the correct answer, 600.
- 10 × 9: Students may multiply 1 and 9, resulting in 9, instead of the correct answer, 90.
- 50 × 6: Students may multiply 5 and 6, resulting in 30, instead of the correct answer, 300."
1846,Is not able to spot a proportional relationship pictorially unless they are laid out in groups,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to visually identify proportional relationships in diagrams or pictures unless the items are arranged in obvious groups or patterns. They may have difficulty recognizing proportional relationships when the items are not organized in a way that makes the proportionality clear, such as when the items are scattered or not aligned. This can lead to difficulties in understanding concepts like equivalent ratios, scaling, and proportionality in various mathematical contexts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the number of objects in two different pictures, students may not recognize that the ratio of objects is the same if the objects are not grouped together.
- When scaling up or down a shape, students may not understand that the proportions of the shape remain the same if the scaled version is not displayed alongside the original shape.
- When interpreting graphs or charts, students may struggle to identify proportional relationships between variables if the data points are not clearly grouped or if the graph is not labeled clearly.
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios, students may rely too heavily on grouping objects rather than understanding the underlying proportional relationship."
1847,Confuses the part and the whole in fraction of an amount problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the part (the fraction) and the whole (the total amount) in fraction of an amount problems. They may incorrectly identify the part as the whole or vice versa, leading to errors in their calculations. For example, when finding 1/4 of 12, students may think that the 1/4 is the whole amount, rather than a part of the whole amount, which is 12.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When finding a fraction of a set of objects, students may count the fraction as the total number of objects, rather than a subset of the total.
* When solving problems involving fractions of measurements, students may confuse the fraction with the total measurement.
* When comparing fractions, students may incorrectly compare the numerators (the parts) instead of considering the relationship between the part and the whole.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A recipe calls for 3/4 cup of flour. A student may think that 3/4 is the total amount of flour needed, rather than a part of the whole cup.
* Case 2: A bookshelf has 12 books, and 1/3 of them are red. A student may think that 1/3 is the total number of books, rather than a part of the whole 12 books.
* Case 3: A pizza is divided into 8 slices, and a student eats 1/4 of it. They may think that 1/4 is the total number of slices, rather than a part of the whole pizza."
1848,Thinks the y coordinate of a point on the x axis is 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of the coordinate plane. They may correctly understand that the x-axis is the horizontal line, but incorrectly believe that any point on the x-axis has a y-coordinate of 1, rather than 0. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of the origin (0,0) or a misunderstanding of how coordinates are represented on a graph.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When plotting points on a graph, a student may consistently write the y-coordinate as 1 for points that lie on the x-axis, such as (3,1) instead of (3,0).
- When identifying the coordinates of a point on the x-axis, a student may state that the y-coordinate is 1, rather than 0.
- When solving problems that involve finding the equation of a line or graphing a function, a student may incorrectly assume that the y-coordinate of a point on the x-axis is 1, leading to incorrect solutions."
1849,Believes the gradient of a line is given by the x intercept,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the gradient of a line and confuse it with the x-intercept. They may believe that the gradient is a point on the line where it crosses the x-axis, rather than a measure of how steep the line is. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the gradient and the coordinates of points on the line.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to find the gradient of a line given its equation, students may look for the x-intercept instead of using the formula for gradient (e.g., rise over run).
- When graphing a line, students may plot the x-intercept and mistakenly label it as the gradient.
- When comparing the steepness of two lines, students may compare their x-intercepts instead of their gradients.
- When solving problems involving the gradient of a line, such as finding the equation of a line or determining the rate of change, students may incorrectly substitute the x-intercept for the gradient."
1850,Mixes up square rooting and fourth rooting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly interchange the mathematical operations of square rooting and fourth rooting. Square rooting involves finding a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number, often denoted by the symbol √. On the other hand, fourth rooting involves finding a value that, when raised to the power of 4, gives the original number, often denoted by the symbol ⁴√.

Students may struggle to differentiate between these two concepts, especially when dealing with perfect squares and perfect fourth powers. They may incorrectly apply the rules of one operation to the other, leading to incorrect results.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When simplifying expressions, students may incorrectly simplify √16 as 2, thinking it's the fourth root, rather than 4, which is the correct square root.
- Case 2: When solving equations, students may mistakenly take the fourth root instead of the square root to isolate a variable, leading to an incorrect solution.
- Case 3: When working with perfect fourth powers, students may incorrectly identify the square root as the correct operation, rather than recognizing the need to take the fourth root. For example, they might think √81 = 9, when actually ⁴√81 = 3.
- Case 4: When dealing with more complex problems, such as those involving exponents or algebraic expressions, students may get confused and mix up the rules of square rooting and fourth rooting, leading to errors in their calculations."
1851,Does not know the properties of an isosceles triangle,"Explanation: An isosceles triangle is a type of triangle with two sides of equal length. Students who hold this misconception may not be aware of the unique properties that come with having two equal sides. They may not recognize that an isosceles triangle has two equal angles (base angles) opposite the equal sides, or that the line of symmetry (altitude) of an isosceles triangle bisects the base angle and the base itself.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Case 1: When asked to identify the angles of an isosceles triangle, a student may not recognize that the base angles are equal and instead assign random values to the angles.
- Case 2: When given a problem involving the perimeter of an isosceles triangle, a student may not take advantage of the fact that two sides have the same length, leading to unnecessary calculations.
- Case 3: When asked to draw an altitude in an isosceles triangle, a student may not recognize that it bisects the base and base angles, resulting in an incorrect diagram.
- Case 4: When solving a problem involving the area of an isosceles triangle, a student may not use the properties of the triangle to simplify the calculation, such as using the base and height (which is also the altitude)."
1852,"When adding an integer to a fraction, thinks you add the integer to the numerator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of adding integers to fractions. They incorrectly assume that when adding an integer to a fraction, they simply add the integer to the numerator, without considering the denominator. This can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.

For example, when asked to calculate 2 + 1/4, a student with this misconception might write 3/4 as the answer, adding the integer 2 to the numerator 1. Similarly, when asked to calculate 3 + 2/5, they might write 5/5, again adding the integer 3 to the numerator 2.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- 1 + 2/3 = ?
- 4 + 1/2 = ?
- 5 + 3/4 = ?

In each of these cases, a student with this misconception will likely add the integer to the numerator, resulting in an incorrect answer."
1853,Thinks an enlargement of any scale factor keeps side lengths the same,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of enlargement and scale factor in geometry. They mistakenly believe that when a shape is enlarged by any scale factor, the side lengths remain the same. This shows a lack of comprehension of the relationship between scale factor and the resulting dimensions of the enlarged shape.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to enlarge a shape by a scale factor greater than 1 and they draw the enlarged shape with the same side lengths as the original shape.
- When students are given the dimensions of an original shape and the scale factor, but they calculate the dimensions of the enlarged shape incorrectly, using the original dimensions instead of multiplying them by the scale factor.
- When students are comparing the side lengths of similar shapes and they incorrectly assume that the side lengths are the same because they are similar, without considering the scale factor.
- When students are solving problems involving real-life applications of enlargement, such as designing buildings or models, and they fail to account for the change in side lengths due to the scale factor."
1854,Confuses tangent and radius,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a tangent to a circle is the same as, or has the same properties as, the radius of the circle. They might think that the tangent is a line that intersects the circle at its center, or that it is the same length as the radius. In reality, the tangent is a line that touches the circle at exactly one point on its circumference, and it is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When drawing diagrams involving circles and tangents, students might draw the tangent line passing through the center of the circle.
- When solving problems involving the length of tangents, students might assume that the length of the tangent is the same as the radius of the circle.
- When determining the relationship between the radius and tangent, students might think that they are parallel or intersect at a 45-degree angle, rather than being perpendicular.
- When solving trigonometry problems involving circles, students might confuse the tangent function with the radius of the circle."
1855,"Believes that if one number in a product decreases, the answer must increase. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between multiplication factors and the product. They might think that if one factor decreases, the product automatically increases, without considering the actual values and how multiplication works. This misconception can lead to incorrect assumptions and calculations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When comparing products with different factors: A student might think that 4 × 5 is greater than 6 × 5 because 4 is less than 6, not realizing that the product actually decreases.
2. When adjusting factors in a multiplication problem: A student might believe that if they decrease one factor, the product will increase, e.g., thinking that 3 × 6 is greater than 4 × 6 because 3 is less than 4.
3. When solving real-world problems involving scaling: A student might mistakenly think that if they reduce the number of items in a set, the total cost or quantity will increase, rather than considering the actual effect of the reduction.
4. When comparing proportions: A student might incorrectly assume that if one quantity decreases, the other quantity must increase, without considering the actual relationship between the quantities."
1856,Thinks multiplication and addition are the same,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the fundamental difference between multiplication and addition. They might view multiplication as simply a shortcut for repeated addition, without fully grasping the concept of scaling or groups that multiplication represents. As a result, they may incorrectly apply addition rules to multiplication problems or vice versa.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When multiplying numbers, students might simply add the numbers together instead of correctly multiplying them. For example, when asked to calculate 3 × 4, they might respond with 7 (3 + 4) instead of 12.
- When solving word problems, students might choose to add instead of multiply, even when the context clearly indicates multiplication. For instance, if a problem states ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils,"" they might add 3 + 4 instead of multiplying 3 × 4.
- When dealing with real-life scenarios, such as calculating the total cost of items or the area of a room, students might confuse multiplication with addition, leading to incorrect results.

This misconception can occur in various situations, including:

- When encountering multiplication problems with small numbers, where the result is close to the sum of the numbers (e.g., 2 × 3 = 6, which is close to 2 + 3 = 5).
- When solving word problems that involve both addition and multiplication, leading to confusion about which operation to apply.
- When working with visual representations, such as arrays or number lines, where the distinction between addition and multiplication might not be immediately clear."
1857,Believes a cubic equation will have a linear graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that the degree of an equation does not affect the shape of its graph. They may think that all equations, regardless of their degree (linear, quadratic, cubic, etc.), will have a straight-line graph. This misunderstanding may be due to a lack of exposure to different types of equations and their corresponding graphs or an incomplete understanding of the relationship between an equation's degree and its graphical representation.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When students are given a cubic equation (e.g., y = x^3) and are asked to sketch its graph, they may draw a straight line.
* When students are presented with a graph of a cubic equation, they may incorrectly identify it as a linear equation.
* When students are solving a problem that involves graphing a cubic equation, they may mistakenly assume that the graph will be a straight line and make incorrect conclusions based on this assumption."
1858,Does not compensate when subtracting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students perform subtraction operations and fail to adjust or compensate when regrouping or borrowing from one place value to another. They might treat each digit in isolation, forgetting that subtraction sometimes requires adjusting the numbers to perform the calculation correctly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Subtracting 45 from 213: Students may write 3 - 5 without realizing they need to borrow from the tens place.
2. Calculating 147 - 79: Students might not compensate when subtracting 9 from 7 and forget to borrow from the tens place.
3. Subtracting 27 from 93: Students may not regroup the numbers correctly and fail to compensate when subtracting 7 from 3."
1859,Thinks the mode in a stem and leaf diagram  is the stem that has the most leaves ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of mode in the context of a stem and leaf diagram. They incorrectly assume that the mode is the stem with the most leaves, rather than understanding that the mode is the actual value that appears most frequently in the dataset. 

In a stem and leaf diagram, the stem represents the first part of a number, and the leaves represent the latter part. Students with this misconception focus solely on the number of leaves attached to each stem, rather than looking at the individual values represented by the stem and leaf combinations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a stem has multiple leaves, but none of the values represented by the stem and leaf combinations are repeated, students may still identify the stem as the mode.
- When a dataset has multiple modes, but the stems representing these modes have a different number of leaves, students may incorrectly choose the stem with the most leaves as the mode.
- When the stem with the most leaves does not actually contain the most frequently occurring value in the dataset, students may mistakenly identify it as the mode."
1860,Believes a reciprocal graph can be a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a reciprocal graph. A reciprocal graph is typically associated with a function of the form y = 1/x or y = k/x, where k is a constant. Students who hold this misconception may incorrectly believe that a reciprocal graph can be represented by a straight line, rather than a curve. They may incorrectly apply the concept of linear relationships to reciprocal relationships, failing to recognize that the graph of a reciprocal function will always be a curve that approaches the x and y axes but never touches them.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing simple reciprocal functions, such as y = 1/x, and incorrectly drawing the graph as a straight line rather than a hyperbola.
- When analyzing real-world data that can be modeled by a reciprocal function, but incorrectly assuming that the relationship is linear.
- When solving problems that involve finding the equation of a reciprocal function, and incorrectly writing the equation in the form of a linear function.
- When comparing and contrasting different types of functions, and incorrectly identifying a reciprocal function as a linear function.
- When working with more complex reciprocal functions, such as y = 2/x or y = x/(x+1), and incorrectly assuming that these functions can be represented by straight lines rather than curves."
1861,Rounds to nearest 50 not 20,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers to the nearest 10 or a multiple of 10, but they incorrectly round to the nearest 50 instead of the nearest 20 or the required multiple. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the rounding rules or an overreliance on the ""round to the nearest 50"" rule, which is sometimes used as a mental math shortcut. As a result, students may round numbers to the nearest 50 even when it's not the most accurate or appropriate.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Rounding 43 to the nearest 10: Instead of rounding to 40, students may round to 50.
- Rounding 27 to the nearest 20: Instead of rounding to 20, students may round to 50.
- Rounding 94 to the nearest 10: Instead of rounding to 90, students may round to 100 (the nearest 50 is 100, but the question asked for the nearest 10).
- Rounding 76 to the nearest 20: Instead of rounding to 80, students may round to 50."
1862,Performs addition ahead of division,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly follow the order of operations, specifically when there are addition and division operations in an expression. The students mistakenly perform the addition first before carrying out the division. 

This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the correct order of operations, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or BOMDAS (Brackets, Orders, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). 

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- 12 ÷ 3 + 2 (Student performs 3 + 2 first and then tries to divide 12 by the result)
- 18 ÷ 2 + 5 (Student adds 2 and 5 first and then tries to divide 18 by the result)
- 9 + 6 ÷ 3 (Student adds 9 and 6 first and then tries to divide the result by 3)"
1863,Thinks 1l = 10 cubic centimetres,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that 1 liter (1l) is equivalent to 10 cubic centimeters (cm³) or milliliters (mL), instead of understanding that 1 liter is actually equal to 1000 cubic centimeters (cm³) or milliliters (mL). This error may be due to a misunderstanding of the conversion factor between units of volume or a lack of understanding of the decimal system.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting between liters and milliliters in a recipe, for example, if a recipe calls for 2 liters of water, the student may think it is equal to 20 cm³.
- When solving a problem that involves calculating the volume of a container, the student may incorrectly convert the volume from liters to cubic centimeters.
- When reading a label on a bottle that states the volume in liters, the student may incorrectly assume it is a much smaller volume.
- When working with measuring instruments, such as a measuring jug or a pipette, the student may misread or miscalculate the measurements due to this misconception."
1864,Does not realise that the order is important in a ratio,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that the order of the parts in a ratio is crucial to its meaning. A ratio is a comparison of two or more numbers, and the order in which these numbers are presented matters. Students may mistakenly believe that the order can be swapped without changing the ratio's meaning. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect interpretations and calculations when working with ratios.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Simplifying ratios: Students may incorrectly simplify a ratio by swapping the order of its parts. For example, they might think that a ratio of 2:3 is the same as 3:2.
- Equivalent ratios: Students may struggle to identify equivalent ratios, thinking that a ratio like 2:3 is the same as 3:2 because they contain the same numbers, just in a different order.
- Real-world applications: In real-world scenarios, such as cooking or building, the order of the ratio is crucial. For example, a recipe that requires a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 1 cup of sugar cannot be reversed without affecting the final product.
- Word problems: Students may misinterpret word problems involving ratios, assuming that the order of the parts is irrelevant. For instance, a problem that states ""a school has a ratio of 2 boys to 3 girls"" is different from ""a school has a ratio of 3 boys to 2 girls""."
1865,"When dividing numbers with different bases, subtracts the powers and subtracts the base numbers.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers with different bases, particularly when dealing with exponential expressions. They may incorrectly assume that to divide numbers with different bases, they need to subtract the powers (exponents) and then subtract the base numbers. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and the rules for dividing numbers with different bases.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing numbers with different bases in exponential form, such as 2^3 ÷ 3^2.
- When solving problems involving the division of numbers with different bases in scientific notation, such as (2 × 10^3) ÷ (3 × 10^2).
- When simplifying algebraic expressions involving the division of numbers with different bases, such as (2x^2) ÷ (3x)."
1866,Confuses additive and multiplicative relationships,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between situations that involve adding or subtracting a fixed amount (additive relationships) and those that involve multiplying or dividing by a factor (multiplicative relationships). 

Students may mistakenly apply additive reasoning to problems that require multiplicative thinking, or vice versa. For instance, when dealing with scaling, enlargement, or proportions, they might add or subtract a fixed amount instead of multiplying or dividing by a factor. Conversely, in situations where a fixed amount is added or subtracted, they might incorrectly apply multiplicative reasoning.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the number of shelves is doubled, how many books can the bookshelf hold now? (Some students may incorrectly add 5 shelves instead of multiplying the number of shelves by 2 and then multiplying the result by 8 books.)

2. A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. If they increase their sales by 15 loaves each day, how many loaves will they sell after 5 days? (Some students may incorrectly multiply 250 by a factor instead of adding 15 loaves to the initial amount for each day.)

3. A picture is enlarged by a scale factor of 3. If the original picture is 10 cm wide, how wide will the enlarged picture be? (Some students may incorrectly add 10 cm two times instead of multiplying the original width by the scale factor of 3.)"
1867,Finds unit price then forgets to multiply up,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the total cost of a certain quantity of items, given the price per unit. They correctly calculate the unit price, but then fail to multiply it by the number of units to find the total cost. Instead, they might just provide the unit price as the answer, or perform some other incorrect operation.

This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of the relationship between unit price and total cost, and/or a failure to read and understand the question being asked.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- Tomatoes are priced at £2 per kilogram. If Sara wants to buy 3 kilograms, how much will she pay in total?
- A bookshelf costs £50 per unit. If a school wants to buy 5 bookshelves, what is the total cost?
- A bakery sells a dozen donuts for £6. If a customer wants to buy 3 dozen donuts, how much will they pay in total?"
1868,Believes lines are parallel if they have the same y intercept ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of parallel lines in the context of coordinate geometry. They may think that as long as two lines have the same y-intercept (i.e., the point at which the line intersects the y-axis), they are parallel. However, this is not a sufficient condition for lines to be parallel.

In reality, parallel lines have the same slope, not necessarily the same y-intercept. This misconception can lead to errors when identifying parallel lines, graphing linear equations, and solving problems involving parallel lines.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Graphing two lines with the same y-intercept but different slopes: A student may graph two lines with the same y-intercept, say (0, 2), but with different slopes, say 2x and 3x. They may incorrectly conclude that these lines are parallel.
2. Identifying parallel lines from equations: Given two linear equations, say y = 2x + 3 and y = 3x + 3, a student may think that these lines are parallel because they have the same y-intercept (0, 3), even though they have different slopes.
3. Real-world applications: In architecture or engineering, students may need to design or analyze systems with parallel lines (e.g., parallel beams or pipes). If they hold this misconception, they may incorrectly assume that lines with the same y-intercept are parallel, leading to potential design flaws."
1869,"Believes that the larger the divisor, the larger the answer.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the divisor and the quotient in division operations. They may think that a larger divisor will result in a larger answer, possibly due to the idea that a larger number is being used in the calculation. However, in reality, the opposite is true: the larger the divisor, the smaller the quotient (answer). 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Case 1: When dividing a fixed quantity among a varying number of groups or people, students may think that having more groups (larger divisor) means each group will get more, when in fact each group will get less.
- Case 2: When comparing division problems, such as 12 ÷ 3 vs 12 ÷ 6, students may incorrectly assume that 12 ÷ 6 will have a larger answer because 6 is larger than 3.
- Case 3: In real-world scenarios, like sharing pizza or sweets, students may think that having more people to share with (larger divisor) means they will get more, when in fact they will get a smaller share."
1870,Thinks there are 10000mm in a metre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between millimeters (mm) and meters (m). They may know that there are 1000 millimeters in 1 meter, but incorrectly multiply this by 10, resulting in 10,000 millimeters. This error could be due to a simple arithmetic mistake, a lack of understanding of the metric system, or a failure to grasp the concept of unit conversions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting measurements from meters to millimeters, such as calculating the length of a room in millimeters.
- When solving problems involving mixed units, such as adding 500 mm to 1 m and incorrectly thinking the answer is 10,500 mm.
- When reading scales or measuring lengths using a ruler, and incorrectly interpreting the markings as 10,000 mm instead of 1000 mm per meter.
- When solving real-world problems, such as measuring the length of a room for furniture placement or calculating the perimeter of a garden bed."
1871,"Thinks factorising a quadratic means factorising the variable terms into a single bracket, and leaving out the constant","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of factorising a quadratic expression. They may think that factorising only involves grouping the terms with variables (e.g., x terms) into a single bracket, while leaving the constant term outside and unaltered. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of how to properly factorise quadratics by finding two numbers whose product is the constant term and whose sum is the coefficient of the middle term.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When factorising the quadratic expression x^2 + 5x + 6, the student may incorrectly write it as (x + 5)x + 6.
* When factorising the quadratic expression x^2 - 7x - 8, the student may incorrectly write it as (x - 7)x - 8.
* When factorising the quadratic expression 2x^2 + 3x + 1, the student may incorrectly write it as (2x + 3)x + 1."
1872,Believes they only need to multiply the first and last pairs of terms when expanding double brackets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to expanding double brackets in algebra, such as (x + 3)(x + 5). They mistakenly believe that they only need to multiply the first terms (x and x) and the last terms (3 and 5), resulting in an incomplete expansion. They might think the answer is just x^2 + 15, ignoring the middle terms that arise from multiplying the outer and inner terms.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Expanding double brackets with two binomials, e.g., (x + 2)(x + 4)
- Expanding double brackets with a binomial and a trinomial, e.g., (x + 2)(x^2 + 3x + 1)
- Solving quadratic equations by factoring and expanding double brackets, e.g., (x + 2)(x - 3) = 0
- Simplifying algebraic expressions involving double brackets, e.g., 2(x + 1)(x - 2) + 3(x + 1)"
1873,Believes the median is the midpoint of the range,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the median of a dataset is the average of the smallest and largest values, or the midpoint of the range. They may think that finding the median involves simply averaging the minimum and maximum values, rather than arranging the data in order and identifying the middle value. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate the median, especially in cases where the data is not evenly distributed.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the median of a dataset with a large range, students may incorrectly assume that the median is the midpoint of the range, rather than finding the actual middle value.
- When dealing with datasets that have outliers, students may be tempted to use the midpoint of the range as the median, rather than ignoring the outliers and finding the true median.
- When working with datasets that have an even number of values, students may incorrectly assume that the median is the average of the smallest and largest values, rather than finding the average of the two middle values.
- When asked to find the median of a dataset that is not in numerical order, students may incorrectly assume that they can simply average the minimum and maximum values, rather than first arranging the data in order."
1874,Believes the median is the frequency for the category in which it is located,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the median of a dataset represents the frequency or number of observations within the category where it falls, rather than the middle value of the dataset when it is arranged in order. They may believe that the median is a measure of how many data points are in a particular category, rather than a measure of the central tendency of the data.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* A student is analyzing a bar chart of exam scores and says, ""The median score is 70, which means 70 students scored between 60-70.""
* A student is looking at a histogram of the heights of their classmates and says, ""The median height is 160cm, so there must be 160 students who are between 155-165cm tall.""
* A student is working with a dataset of temperatures and says, ""The median temperature is 20°C, which means it was 20°C for 20 days."""
1875,Has used a subtraction sign to represent division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly use a subtraction sign (-) to indicate division, instead of the correct division sign (/ or ÷). This could be due to various reasons, such as a lack of understanding of the different mathematical operations, confusion with the symbols, or simply a habit formed from incorrect practice.

For example, when faced with a simple division problem, such as 12 ÷ 3, a student with this misconception might write 12 - 3, indicating that they are using the subtraction sign to represent division. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the fundamental concept of division.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simple division problems: 15 ÷ 5 might be written as 15 - 5.
2. Word problems involving sharing: ""If I have 18 pencils and I want to share them equally among 3 of my friends, how many pencils will each friend get?"" might be solved using 18 - 3 instead of 18 ÷ 3.
3. Division with remainders: 25 ÷ 4 might be written as 25 - 4, ignoring the remainder.
4. Real-world applications: Measuring ingredients for a recipe that requires dividing quantities, such as 250g ÷ 5, might be incorrectly represented as 250 - 5."
1876,Counts leading zero as a significant figure,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that leading zeros in a number are significant figures. Significant figures are the digits in a number that are known to be reliable and certain, and are used to express the precision of a measurement or calculation. However, leading zeros are simply placeholders and do not provide any additional information about the precision of the number. For example, the number 0.045 has two significant figures (4 and 5), but some students may incorrectly count the leading zero as a significant figure, thinking that the number has three significant figures.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

* When recording measurements, such as 0.050 kg, where the leading zero is mistakenly counted as a significant figure.
* When performing calculations, such as adding or subtracting numbers with leading zeros, where the student incorrectly assumes that the leading zeros contribute to the number of significant figures in the answer.
* When rounding numbers, such as rounding 0.045 to two significant figures, where the student incorrectly includes the leading zero as one of the significant figures.
* When converting between units, such as converting 0.05 meters to centimeters, where the leading zero is mistakenly retained as a significant figure."
1877,Thinks rectangles have rotational symmetry or order 4,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a rectangle has rotational symmetry of order 4, meaning that if it is rotated by 90 degrees (or a quarter turn), it will look exactly the same. They might think this because a rectangle has two pairs of opposite sides that are equal in length and two pairs of opposite angles that are equal in measure, which can lead them to assume that it has the same level of rotational symmetry as a square.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or identifying symmetries in various shapes, a student might incorrectly label a rectangle as having rotational symmetry of order 4.
- When asked to give examples of shapes with rotational symmetry, a student might incorrectly include a rectangle in their list.
- When solving problems that involve tiling or tessellations, a student might incorrectly assume that rectangles can be used to create a pattern with rotational symmetry of order 4.
- When exploring real-world examples of symmetry, such as architecture or art, a student might incorrectly identify a rectangular shape as having rotational symmetry of order 4."
1878,"In inverse proportion, believes that if one variable is a reciprocal, the other variable will be the reciprocal as well. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of inverse proportionality. They may think that if two variables are inversely proportional, and one variable is expressed as a reciprocal (i.e., 1/x), the other variable must also be expressed as a reciprocal. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly assume that the relationship between the variables is a simple reciprocal relationship, rather than an inverse proportional relationship.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When solving problems involving inverse proportionality, such as the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task. For example, if the number of workers is doubled, the time taken to complete the task is halved, but students may incorrectly assume that if the number of workers is expressed as a reciprocal (e.g., 1/2), the time taken must also be expressed as a reciprocal.
* When graphing inverse proportional relationships, students may incorrectly assume that the graph will be a simple reciprocal curve, rather than a hyperbola.
* When solving algebraic equations involving inverse proportionality, students may incorrectly simplify the equation by taking the reciprocal of both variables, rather than applying the correct inverse proportional relationship."
1879,Believes midpoint of an interval is used rather than total frequency to calculate the sector angle for a pie chart,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to calculate the sector angle of a pie chart, they should find the midpoint of an interval of a data set and use that value, rather than using the total frequency of the data set. The students may incorrectly assume that the midpoint is a crucial factor in determining the proportion of the pie chart that represents a specific category or value, rather than understanding that it's actually the total frequency or proportion of the data that determines the sector angle.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When creating a pie chart to display categorical data, such as favorite colors, and students think the midpoint between the number of students who like each color should be used to determine the sector angle.
- When representing data on the number of hours spent on different activities, and students believe that finding the midpoint between the number of hours spent on each activity will give them the correct sector angle.
- When analyzing data on the number of students in different age groups, and students incorrectly assume that the midpoint between the age ranges is the key to calculating the sector angle."
1880,Mixes up greater than and less than symbols,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the symbols for ""greater than"" (>) and ""less than"" (<). They may think that the symbol "">"" means less than, and the symbol ""<"" means greater than. This can be due to various reasons such as lack of understanding of the concept, inadequate practice, or simply memorizing the symbols without fully grasping their meaning.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* When comparing numbers: A student may write 5 > 3 as 5 < 3, thinking that 5 is less than 3.
* When solving inequalities: A student may solve the inequality 2x > 5 as 2x < 5, leading to an incorrect solution.
* When interpreting data: A student may look at a graph and think that a value is greater than another when it is actually less than, due to misinterpreting the > and < symbols.
* When solving word problems: A student may read a problem that says ""Tom has more than 10 pencils"" and write it as an inequality using the < symbol instead of the > symbol."
1881,Halves when asked to find the cube root,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the cube root of a number, but instead, they find half of the number. This shows a misunderstanding of the concept of cube roots, where students are mistakenly applying the concept of halving, which is related to division by 2, rather than understanding that cube roots involve finding a number that, when cubed, gives the original value.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the cube root of a perfect cube, such as the cube root of 8 or 27, and they respond with half of the number, e.g., 4 or 13.5, instead of the correct answer, which is 2 or 3, respectively.
- When students are given a word problem involving cube roots, such as finding the length of the edge of a cube with a volume of 64 cubic units, and they respond by dividing the volume by 2, rather than finding the cube root of 64, which is 4.
- When students are given a mathematical expression, such as ∛125, and they simplify it to 62.5, which is half of 125, instead of the correct answer, which is 5."
1882,Believes square numbers are triangle numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that square numbers (numbers obtained by squaring integers, e.g., 1, 4, 9, 16) are the same as triangle numbers (numbers obtained by adding consecutive integers, e.g., 1, 3, 6, 10). They might think that because both types of numbers are formed by patterns of dots or blocks, they are equivalent. This misconception can occur due to a lack of understanding of the distinct properties and definitions of square and triangle numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to identify or generate examples of square numbers, they may include triangle numbers in their response.
- When solving problems involving patterns, students might confuse the formula for square numbers (n^2) with the formula for triangle numbers (n(n+1)/2).
- In visual representations, students might misinterpret the arrangement of dots or blocks in a triangle pattern as a square number pattern.
- When asked to explain the properties of square numbers, students may describe characteristics of triangle numbers instead."
1883,Uses only the base and perpendicular height when calculating the area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with calculating the area of triangles and rectangles, but misunderstand or oversimplify the formula for the area of a trapezium. They may incorrectly assume that the area of a trapezium only depends on its base and perpendicular height, neglecting the fact that a trapezium has two parallel sides (bases) of different lengths. As a result, they may use an incomplete or incorrect formula, such as using the base and height of only one triangle, or averaging the bases without considering the actual shape of the trapezium.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are given a trapezium with two parallel sides of different lengths and are asked to calculate its area.
* When students are asked to compare the areas of different trapezia with varying base lengths and heights.
* When students are solving real-world problems involving trapezia, such as calculating the area of a garden bed or a roof, and they fail to account for the two parallel sides of different lengths.
* When students are presented with a diagram of a trapezium and are asked to identify the relevant dimensions needed to calculate its area, but they only consider the base and perpendicular height."
1884,Thinks numbers are a multiple of their index,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a number's value is directly related to its position or index in a sequence or pattern. They might assume that if a number is in the 3rd position, it must be a multiple of 3, or if it's in the 5th position, it must be a multiple of 5. This misunderstanding can lead students to make incorrect assumptions and calculations when working with sequences, patterns, or even basic arithmetic operations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When working with number sequences, such as identifying the next number in a pattern (e.g., 2, 5, 8, ?).
* When solving multiplication or division problems, where students may assume that the answer must be a multiple of the multiplier or divisor (e.g., 4 × 6 = ?).
* When analyzing data and looking for patterns or trends, students may incorrectly assume that the data follows a specific multiple or sequence based on its position.
* When working with algebraic expressions, such as simplifying or solving equations, where students may mistakenly apply this misconception to variables or coefficients."
1885,Thinks a power raised to a power leads to addition of the powers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that raising a power to another power results in adding the exponents rather than multiplying them. For instance, students might think that (2^3)^4 is equal to 2^(3+4) instead of the correct application of the power rule in exponents.

Cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions with multiple exponents: When simplifying expressions like (x^2)^5, students with this misconception might write x^(2+5) instead of the correct x^(2*5).

2. Evaluating numerical expressions: In problems like (3^2)^3, students may calculate 3^(2+3) instead of the correct 3^(2*3).

3. Solving algebraic equations: This misconception can also arise when solving equations like (x^3)^2 = x^6. Students might incorrectly simplify it as x^(3+2) instead of the correct x^(3*2)."
1886,Does not understand that base angles in an isosceles are equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the unique property of isosceles triangles, which states that the two base angles (the angles opposite the equal sides) are congruent. Students may mistakenly believe that only the sides are equal, without realizing the equality of the base angles. This misunderstanding may stem from a lack of exposure to isosceles triangles, insufficient practice, or a failure to visualize the relationship between the equal sides and the corresponding angles.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When drawing or constructing an isosceles triangle, a student might label the base angles with different measurements, showing a lack of understanding of their equality.
2. Given an isosceles triangle with two equal sides, a student might calculate the measure of one base angle but not recognize that the other base angle has the same measure.
3. In a problem involving the sum of angles in an isosceles triangle, a student might incorrectly assume that the base angles have different measures, leading to an incorrect solution.
4. When solving a problem that involves identifying the type of triangle based on its angle measurements, a student might fail to recognize an isosceles triangle due to their misconception about the base angles."
1887,Adds instead of subtracts when asked to find the difference,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the difference between two numbers, but instead of subtracting the smaller number from the larger number, they add the two numbers together. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of ""difference"" or a lack of understanding of the subtraction operation. Students may also confuse the words ""difference"" and ""total"" or ""sum"", leading them to perform the wrong operation.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When comparing the scores of two teams, a student may add the scores together instead of subtracting to find the difference.
* When calculating the change in temperature, a student may add the initial and final temperatures instead of subtracting to find the difference.
* When finding the difference in height between two objects, a student may add the heights together instead of subtracting to find the difference.
* When calculating the difference between the number of items sold and the number of items remaining, a student may add the two numbers together instead of subtracting to find the difference."
1888,Does not know the information each vertical line of a box plot represents,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to understand the components of a box plot, specifically the information represented by each vertical line. In a box plot, there are several vertical lines that represent different values in the data set, such as the minimum value, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum value. Students with this misconception may struggle to identify what each line represents, leading to incorrect interpretations of the data.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to create a box plot from a given data set and incorrectly label the vertical lines.
- When students are given a box plot and asked to identify specific values, such as the median or interquartile range (IQR), but are unable to do so.
- When students are comparing two or more box plots and fail to recognize the differences in the data sets due to their lack of understanding of the vertical lines.
- When students are asked to analyze a box plot and identify outliers, but are unable to do so because they don't understand the information represented by each vertical line."
1889,Believes f(x - a) translates the function up a units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of the expression f(x - a) on the graph of a function. They incorrectly believe that subtracting 'a' from the input variable 'x' will shift the graph of the function upwards by 'a' units. This misunderstanding shows a lack of grasp of function transformations, specifically horizontal shifts. Students with this misconception may struggle to visualize and predict the effects of transformations on function graphs.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When graphing functions such as f(x) = (x - 2)^2, a student might expect the graph to be shifted up 2 units rather than to the right 2 units.
- When analyzing the transformation of a sine function, such as f(x) = sin(x - π), a student may incorrectly assume that the graph will be shifted up by π units instead of being shifted to the right by π units.
- In a problem requiring the student to describe the effect of f(x - 3) on a given function, they may incorrectly state that the function is shifted up 3 units."
1890,Thinks the multiplication sign means to add,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the multiplication sign (×) as an addition operation rather than a repeated addition or groups of operation. They may believe that when they see 3 × 4, it means 3 + 4, rather than 3 groups of 4. This misconception can stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication as repeated addition or an incomplete understanding of the multiplication symbol.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to the multiplication symbol and have not fully grasped its meaning.
- When students are multiplying small numbers, such as 2 × 3, and the result is close to the sum of the numbers (2 + 3 = 5, which is close to 2 × 3 = 6).
- When students are dealing with word problems that involve addition and multiplication, and they get confused about which operation to apply.
- When students are faced with real-world scenarios that involve repeated groups, but they are not able to recognize the multiplication aspect of the problem."
1891,Believes they can cross-cancel before flipping the second fraction when dividing fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing fractions and they incorrectly believe that they can cross-cancel (or simplify) before flipping the second fraction. Cross-cancellation is a valid operation, but only when adding or multiplying fractions, not when dividing. When dividing fractions, students should first flip the second fraction (i.e., change the division to multiplication by taking the reciprocal of the divisor), and then simplify if possible.

This misconception can lead to incorrect results, as the student is essentially changing the operation and altering the original problem.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- 1/4 ÷ 2/3, student might cancel 2 and 4 before flipping the second fraction.
- 3/5 ÷ 6/7, student might cancel 3 and 6 before flipping the second fraction.
- 2/3 ÷ 4/9, student might cancel 2 and 4 or 3 and 9 before flipping the second fraction.

These cases demonstrate how the misconception can lead to incorrect results and emphasize the importance of following the correct procedure when dividing fractions."
1892,Does not recognise the sin graph,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to identify or recall the characteristic shape and properties of the sine graph in trigonometry. The sine graph is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in the study of periodic functions and wave patterns. Students with this misconception may struggle to recognize the sinusoidal shape, its amplitude, period, and phase shift, leading to difficulties in graphing and analyzing sine functions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to graph a sine function, such as y = sin(x), and they fail to recognize the characteristic ""S"" shape.
* When students are given a graph and asked to identify whether it represents a sine, cosine, or tangent function, and they incorrectly identify or fail to recognize the sine graph.
* When students are solving problems involving periodic phenomena, such as sound waves or light waves, and they are unable to visualize or sketch the sine graph to model these phenomena.
* When students are working with trigonometric identities and equations, and they fail to recognize the sine graph as a fundamental component of these relationships."
1893,"Believes the y intercept is given by the difference between the x and y coordinates of any point on the line, not just the point (0, c) ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the y-intercept in the context of linear equations. They believe that the y-intercept can be found by taking any point on the line and subtracting the x-coordinate from the y-coordinate. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the y-intercept's definition as the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which is the point (0, c) in the equation y = mx + c.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are given the equation of a line, say y = 2x + 3, and a point on the line (4, 11), they might think the y-intercept is 11 - 4 = 7 instead of looking at the equation and identifying the y-intercept as 3.
- When students are given a graph of a line and asked to find the y-intercept, they might choose any point on the line and subtract the x-coordinate from the y-coordinate, rather than looking for the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
- When students are solving problems involving linear equations, they might apply this misconception to find the y-intercept, leading to incorrect solutions."
1894,Confuses the part and the whole in missing number subtraction problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of subtraction as finding a missing part, rather than finding the difference between two quantities. In missing number subtraction problems, students are given a set of numbers and are asked to find the missing number that would make the equation true. For example, in the problem ""5 - ? = 3"", students with this misconception might think that the missing number is the whole (5), rather than the part that needs to be subtracted from the whole to get 3.

This misconception arises because students may focus on the initial quantity (the whole) rather than the amount being taken away (the part). As a result, they may provide the whole as the answer, rather than the actual missing number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- ""15 - ? = 9"" (student answers 15 instead of 6)
- ""8 - ? = 2"" (student answers 8 instead of 6)
- ""24 - ? = 17"" (student answers 24 instead of 7)
- ""9 - ? = 4"" (student answers 9 instead of 5)"
1895,Does not realise that all circles are similar,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand that all circles, regardless of their size, share the same shape and geometric properties. They may believe that circles with different radii or diameters are fundamentally different and cannot be compared directly. This misunderstanding can lead students to think that similarity only applies to other shapes, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, but not to circles.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When comparing the properties of two circles with different radii, students may not recognize that they have the same shape and that their corresponding angles and proportions are equal.
* When solving problems involving circles, students may attempt to use different formulas or approaches for circles of different sizes, rather than applying the same principles and formulas to all circles.
* When exploring the concept of similarity in geometry, students may exclude circles from the discussion, assuming that they do not fit the criteria for similarity.
* When working with real-world applications, such as designing circular patterns or calculating the area of circular shapes, students may not recognize that the principles of similarity apply to all circles, regardless of their size."
1896,"When finding the gradient from the equation of a line in the form ax + by = c, believes b/a is the gradient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with the slope-intercept form of a linear equation (y = mx + c), where 'm' represents the gradient. However, when dealing with the general form of a linear equation (ax + by = c), students incorrectly assume that the coefficient of y (b) divided by the coefficient of x (a) gives the gradient, resulting in the incorrect formula b/a. They fail to recognize that to find the gradient, the equation needs to be rearranged into the slope-intercept form or use the formula -a/b for the gradient.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given an equation in the form ax + by = c and are asked to find the gradient without rearranging it into the slope-intercept form.
- When comparing the gradients of two lines given in different forms (e.g., one in slope-intercept form and the other in general form).
- When finding the gradient of a line given in the general form and using it to determine the line's steepness or to draw the line on a graph.
- When solving problems involving perpendicular lines, where the product of the gradients is -1, and the equation of one of the lines is given in the general form."
1897,Confuses vertically opposite angles and angles around a point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between vertically opposite angles and angles around a point. Vertically opposite angles refer to the angles that are formed by two intersecting lines, where the angles are opposite each other and share the same vertex. On the other hand, angles around a point refer to the sum of all the angles formed by multiple lines intersecting at a single point.

Students who hold this misconception may believe that all angles around a point are equal or that vertically opposite angles are not always equal. They may also incorrectly apply the properties of one concept to the other.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When finding missing angles in a diagram with intersecting lines, students may incorrectly assume that all angles around the point are equal.
2. When solving problems involving the sum of angles around a point, students may mistakenly apply the property of vertically opposite angles being equal.
3. In geometry problems involving the construction of angles, students may incorrectly identify vertically opposite angles as being different sizes.
4. When working with real-world examples, such as designing a building or a bridge, students may apply the wrong concept, leading to incorrect calculations and designs."
1898,"When adding decimals, just adds the digits and ignores place value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students treat decimal addition as simple digit-by-digit addition, neglecting the importance of place value. They may view the decimal point as just a separator, rather than understanding its role in representing the relationship between different place values. As a result, they add the digits without considering the actual value of each digit in relation to its position.

For example:

* Case 1: Adding 2.5 + 1.8, a student with this misconception might simply add the digits: 2 + 1 = 3 and 5 + 8 = 13, resulting in an incorrect answer of 3.13.
* Case 2: When adding 4.2 + 3.9, the student might again ignore place value and add the digits: 4 + 3 = 7 and 2 + 9 = 11, leading to an incorrect answer of 7.11.
* Case 3: Adding 1.4 + 2.7, the student might add the digits without considering place value: 1 + 2 = 3 and 4 + 7 = 11, resulting in an incorrect answer of 3.11."
1899,Thinks the missing length has to be half the length of the side given,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with finding missing lengths in shapes, particularly in symmetrical or seemingly symmetrical figures. They may assume that if one side of a shape is given, the missing length must be half of that given side. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of different shapes and the relationships between their sides. Students with this misconception might not consider the type of shape, its angles, or the actual proportions of its sides.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the missing length of a triangle, students might assume it's half the length of the given side, regardless of the type of triangle (e.g., equilateral, isosceles, scalene).
- In problems involving rectangles or squares, students might mistakenly apply this rule, failing to recognize that the given side might be the length, width, or diagonal.
- When dealing with more complex shapes, such as trapezoids or irregular polygons, students may incorrectly apply the ""half the length"" rule due to a lack of understanding of the shape's properties.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring rooms or objects, students might make incorrect assumptions about the proportions of lengths, leading to inaccurate calculations."
1900,Thinks two variables next to each other represent addition,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when two variables are written next to each other, such as '2x' or 'ab', it implies an addition operation between the variables. They may think that '2x' represents '2 + x' or 'ab' represents 'a + b'. This misunderstanding arises from their prior experience with numbers, where two numbers next to each other typically do indicate addition. However, in algebra, variables next to each other usually represent multiplication.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as '2x' or '3y', students may incorrectly rewrite them as '2 + x' or '3 + y'.
- When solving equations, such as '2x = 6', students may mistakenly rewrite it as '2 + x = 6'.
- When expanding expressions, such as '(2x)(3y)', students may incorrectly expand it as '2 + x + 3 + y' instead of '6xy'."
1901,Subtracted base numbers as well as powers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with subtraction of numbers with exponents and they incorrectly subtract both the base numbers and their powers. For instance, when subtracting numbers with exponents, students might treat the base and the exponent separately, subtracting the bases and then subtracting the exponents. This shows a misunderstanding of how to apply the rules of exponents when subtracting numbers with exponents.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting numbers with the same base but different exponents (e.g., 5^3 - 5^2).
- Subtracting numbers with different bases and exponents (e.g., 3^4 - 2^3).
- Simplifying algebraic expressions involving exponents (e.g., 2x^2 - x^3)."
1902,Gets the minutes and hours the wrong way around,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the positions of the hours and minutes when telling time, leading to incorrect time readings. For example, if the time is 3:45, a student with this misconception may read it as 45:3 or 45 hours and 3 minutes.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to analog clocks and struggle to understand the concept of hours and minutes.
- When students are asked to convert between digital and analog time representations.
- When students are solving problems that involve time calculations, such as finding the duration between two times or adding a certain amount of time to a given time.
- When students are reading or writing times in different formats, such as 24-hour or 12-hour clocks.
- When students are working with word problems that involve time, such as scheduling or timing events."
1903,Thinks all lines on a net will form edges in 3D,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with 3D shapes and their nets. They mistakenly believe that every line drawn on a 2D net will automatically become an edge on the corresponding 3D shape. They fail to understand that some lines on the net are actually fold lines or internal boundaries that help create the 3D shape, rather than edges of the shape itself.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are constructing 3D shapes from nets and assume that every line on the net should be a visible edge on the 3D shape.
* When students are counting the number of edges on a 3D shape and include fold lines or internal boundaries in their count.
* When students are drawing nets for 3D shapes and draw unnecessary lines, thinking that they will all become edges on the 3D shape.
* When students are visualizing 3D shapes from 2D nets and have difficulty distinguishing between edges and fold lines."
1904,Believes the numbers in factorising should multiply to give the coefficient of x and add to give the constant,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to factorise quadratic expressions in the form of ax^2 + bx + c. They mistakenly believe that when factorising, the numbers they choose should multiply to give the coefficient of x (b) and add to give the constant term (c). This misunderstanding shows a reversal of the correct relationship between the numbers and the terms in the quadratic expression. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Factorising the quadratic expression x^2 + 5x + 6, where students might think the numbers should multiply to 5 and add to 6.
- Factorising the quadratic expression x^2 + 7x + 12, where students might believe the numbers should multiply to 7 and add to 12.
- Factorising the quadratic expression x^2 + 9x + 20, where students might think the numbers should multiply to 9 and add to 20."
1905,Believes that when finding bounds you round to the nearest whole number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the upper or lower bounds of a measurement or a number, and they mistakenly believe that rounding to the nearest whole number is the correct method. They may not fully understand the concept of bounds, which involves considering the maximum or minimum possible value of a measurement or number, taking into account the unit of measurement or the degree of accuracy.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When finding the upper and lower bounds of a measurement in a real-world context, like measuring the length of a room or the weight of an object.
* When working with measurements that have a degree of accuracy, like a scale that measures to the nearest 0.1 kg, and the student rounds to the nearest whole number instead of considering the bounds.
* When solving problems that involve inequalities or ranges of values, and the student incorrectly rounds the bounds to the nearest whole number, leading to incorrect solutions.

For example:

* If a pencil is measured to be 15.4 cm long, with an accuracy of 0.1 cm, a student with this misconception may round the length to 15 cm, instead of finding the upper and lower bounds (15.3 cm and 15.5 cm).
* If a bag of apples weighs 4.7 kg on a scale that measures to the nearest 0.1 kg, a student may round the weight to 5 kg, instead of considering the upper and lower bounds (4.6 kg and 4.8 kg)."
1906,Gives 3-letter angle notation in the wrong order,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly identify or write the 3-letter notation for angles in geometry, specifically in the context of naming angles in a diagram. The 3-letter notation typically consists of three points that define the angle, with the middle letter being the vertex of the angle. However, students may mistakenly write the letters in the wrong order, often swapping the first and third letters or writing them in a different sequence.

This misconception can arise due to various reasons, such as:

* Lack of understanding of the convention used to name angles in geometry.
* Insufficient practice in identifying and naming angles in different diagrams.
* Difficulty in visualizing the relationship between the angle and the points that define it.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When identifying angles in a triangle, a student may write ∠ABC as ∠CBA or ∠ACB.
* In a diagram with multiple intersecting lines, a student may incorrectly name an angle as ∠DEF instead of ∠EFD or ∠FED.
* When solving problems involving angles in a circle, a student may mistakenly write ∠AOB as ∠BOA or ∠ABO."
1907,Believes an interior angle in a regular polygon can be found using 360 subtract (180 over number of sides),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the formula for finding the sum of interior angles in a polygon, which is (n-2)*180, and the formula for finding the measure of each interior angle in a regular polygon, which is indeed related to the number of sides. They incorrectly modify the formula to find an individual interior angle by subtracting a fraction from 360, thinking that 360 is the total sum of angles and that each angle's share would be found by dividing 180 by the number of sides and then subtracting that value from 360.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:
- Finding the measure of each interior angle in a regular hexagon (6 sides).
- Calculating the measure of each interior angle in a regular triangle (3 sides).
- Determining the measure of each interior angle in a regular octagon (8 sides)."
1908,Ignores numerical terms when setting up an equation from a question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard numerical terms, such as constants or coefficients, when translating a word problem into a mathematical equation. They might focus solely on the variables and operation mentioned in the problem, neglecting the numerical values that are also part of the equation. As a result, their equation may be incomplete, inaccurate, or entirely incorrect.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. In a problem like ""Tom has 5 more than twice as many pencils as his friend,"" students might set up the equation as 2x instead of 2x + 5, ignoring the ""+ 5"" term.

2. When solving a problem like ""A book costs £8 more than 3 times the cost of a pencil,"" students might write the equation as 3x instead of 3x + 8, neglecting the additional £8.

3. In a question like ""A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread at £2 each and also charges a £5 delivery fee,"" students might calculate the total cost as 250 x 2, forgetting to add the £5 delivery fee.

4. In an algebraic problem like ""Solve for x: x - 3 = 7,"" students might incorrectly solve for x by only considering the variable and the operation (x = 7 + ?), forgetting to include the numerical term (-3) in their calculation."
1909,Does not consider the denominator when adding/ subtracting fractions. Adds/subtracts the numerator and makes the denominator the one with the highest value.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. They tend to focus solely on the numerators, adding or subtracting them as if they were whole numbers, without considering the denominators. When it comes to the denominator, they mistakenly assume that the result should have the highest denominator value among the fractions being added or subtracted. This results in an incorrect calculation and a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When adding fractions with different denominators, such as 1/4 + 1/6, the student might add the numerators (1 + 1 = 2) and use the highest denominator (6), resulting in an incorrect answer of 2/6.
* When subtracting fractions with different denominators, such as 3/8 - 2/4, the student might subtract the numerators (3 - 2 = 1) and use the highest denominator (8), resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/8.
* When adding or subtracting fractions with the same numerator but different denominators, such as 2/3 + 2/5, the student might add the numerators (2 + 2 = 4) and use the highest denominator (5), resulting in an incorrect answer of 4/5."
1910,Confuses relative frequency and expected frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between relative frequency, which represents the proportion of times a particular event or value occurs within a dataset, and expected frequency, which is a theoretical prediction of how often an event should occur based on probability. Students may incorrectly use these terms interchangeably or misunderstand how they relate to each other, leading to incorrect interpretations of data and statistical analyses.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing the results of a survey, a student might mistakenly report the relative frequency of a response (e.g., 25% of respondents chose option A) as the expected frequency (e.g., we expect 25 people to choose option A in a sample of 100).
- In a probability experiment, such as flipping a coin, a student may confuse the relative frequency of heads (e.g., 60% of flips resulted in heads) with the expected frequency of heads (e.g., we expect 50% of flips to result in heads, based on the coin's fairness).
- When creating a histogram or bar chart, students might mislabel the axes or misinterpret the data, using relative frequency instead of expected frequency, or vice versa, to describe the distribution of values."
1911,Only multiplies second term in the expansion of a bracket,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are expanding a bracket in algebra, particularly when using the distributive property. They mistakenly believe that only the second term inside the bracket should be multiplied by the term outside the bracket, rather than multiplying every term inside the bracket by the term outside. This results in an incomplete expansion and incorrect solution.

Example cases where this misconception may occur:

- Expanding the expression 2(x + 3), where students might write 2x + 3 instead of 2x + 6.
- Simplifying the expression 3(x - 2), where students might write 3x - 2 instead of 3x - 6.
- Expanding the expression 4(2x + 1), where students might write 4(2x) + 1 instead of 8x + 4."
1912,Gives the probability out of the number of non-successes rather than the total,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly calculate the probability of an event by dividing the number of successful outcomes by the number of unsuccessful outcomes, rather than dividing by the total number of possible outcomes. This indicates a misunderstanding of the fundamental concept of probability, which is defined as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A student is asked to find the probability of rolling a 6 on a fair six-sided die. They may mistakenly divide 1 (the number of successful outcomes) by 5 (the number of non-successful outcomes), rather than dividing 1 by 6 (the total number of possible outcomes).
- In a class of 20 students, 4 students have blue eyes. A student may incorrectly calculate the probability of a student having blue eyes by dividing 4 (the number of students with blue eyes) by 16 (the number of students without blue eyes), rather than dividing 4 by 20 (the total number of students).
- A coin is flipped 10 times, and heads comes up 3 times. A student may mistakenly calculate the probability of getting heads by dividing 3 (the number of successful outcomes) by 7 (the number of non-successful outcomes), rather than dividing 3 by 10 (the total number of flips)."
1913,"Gives the smallest whole when asked for the smallest fraction shaded, presented visually","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are presented with a visual representation of a fraction, such as a shaded part of a circle or a rectangle, and are asked to identify the smallest fraction shaded. Instead of considering the proportion of the shaded area to the whole, students may focus on the absolute size of the shaded area and incorrectly conclude that the smallest whole number (e.g., 1) is the smallest fraction shaded. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When comparing fractions with different denominators, students might think that 1/8 is smaller than 2/16 because 1 is smaller than 2, without considering the proportion of the shaded area.
* When identifying fractions in a set of shaded shapes, students might choose the shape with the smallest absolute shaded area, rather than the shape with the smallest proportion of shaded area.
* When ordering fractions from smallest to largest, students might incorrectly place 1/4 before 1/8 because they focus on the whole number part (1) rather than the proportion of the shaded area."
1914,Converts fraction to percentage by multiplying the denominator by 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a fraction to a percentage involves multiplying the denominator by 10. They may think that since percentages involve ""hundreds,"" they need to multiply the denominator by 10 to somehow scale it up to a percentage. However, this approach neglects the actual relationship between fractions and percentages, which involves converting the fraction to a decimal and then multiplying by 100.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When converting a simple fraction like 1/5 to a percentage, a student may multiply 5 by 10 to get 50, and then think the percentage is 50% (instead of converting 1/5 to 0.2 and then multiplying by 100 to get 20%).
* When comparing fractions and percentages in a real-world problem, such as calculating the percentage of students who like a particular food in a class survey, a student may apply this incorrect method to convert the fraction to a percentage, leading to an incorrect answer.
* When solving a multi-step problem involving fractions and percentages, such as finding the percentage increase in a price that is expressed as a fraction, a student may introduce this error and carry it through the rest of the calculation."
1915,When multiplying mixed numbers thinks they add the integers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying mixed numbers, which consist of both whole numbers and fractions. They tend to incorrectly add the integers (whole numbers) together instead of multiplying them along with the fractions. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplying mixed numbers or a misunderstanding of the distributive property of multiplication over addition.

For example, when multiplying 2 1/2 and 3 1/2, students with this misconception may add the integers (2 + 3) and then multiply or add the fractions (1/2 + 1/2 or 1/2 * 1/2), resulting in an incorrect calculation.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Multiplying 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 to find the area of a rectangle.
- Calculating the cost of 2 3/4 meters of fabric at a rate of 3 1/2 dollars per meter.
- Determining the product of 3 1/4 and 2 3/4 in a recipe for baking a cake."
1916,"When subtracting fractions, subtracts the numerators and multiplies the denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to fraction operations, particularly subtraction. They may mistakenly apply a combination of rules from addition and multiplication of fractions to the subtraction operation. They believe that to subtract fractions, you simply subtract the numerators (the numbers on top) and multiply the denominators (the numbers on the bottom). This incorrect approach can lead to confusion and incorrect results.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Subtracting two fractions with different denominators. For example, 1/4 - 1/6. A student with this misconception might calculate this as (1-1) / (4*6), resulting in 0/24.
- Case 2: Subtracting fractions with the same denominator but different numerators. For example, 3/8 - 2/8. A student might incorrectly calculate this as (3-2) / (8*8), resulting in 1/64.
- Case 3: Word problems involving fraction subtraction, such as ""Tom has 3/4 of a pizza, and he gives 1/4 to his friend. What fraction of the pizza does Tom have left?"" A student with this misconception might calculate this as (3-1) / (4*4), resulting in 2/16."
1917,Confuses the meaning of parallel and perpendicular,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the concepts of parallel and perpendicular lines. They may mistakenly believe that parallel lines intersect or cross each other, or that perpendicular lines never intersect. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect assumptions and errors in various geometric problems, such as identifying angles, shapes, and relationships between lines.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When identifying the properties of shapes: Students may incorrectly identify a shape as having parallel or perpendicular sides, leading to misunderstandings about the shape's properties.
2. When solving angle problems: Students may mistakenly assume that parallel lines intersect, leading to incorrect calculations of angles and angle relationships.
3. When working with coordinate geometry: Students may struggle to identify parallel and perpendicular lines on a coordinate plane, leading to errors in graphing and problem-solving.
4. When solving real-world problems: Students may apply their misconceptions to real-world scenarios, such as designing buildings or roads, leading to incorrect and impractical solutions.
5. When interpreting diagrams: Students may misinterpret diagrams that involve parallel and perpendicular lines, leading to incorrect conclusions and misunderstandings about the relationships between shapes and lines."
1918,Does not fully simplify ratio,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not fully simplify ratios, often leaving them in a form that is not in its simplest or most reduced state. A simplified ratio is one where the numbers have no common factors other than 1. Students may not fully simplify ratios due to a lack of understanding of equivalent ratios, not recognizing common factors, or not applying the concept of greatest common divisors (GCD) to simplify ratios.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Simplifying a ratio by dividing only one of the numbers by their greatest common divisor, but not both.
- Failing to recognize common factors between the numbers in a ratio.
- Not understanding that simplifying a ratio does not change its value, but rather expresses it in a more reduced form.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Simplifying the ratio 6:8, a student may divide only the 6 by 2, resulting in an incorrect simplification of 3:8, instead of dividing both numbers by their GCD, which is 2, to get the correct simplification of 3:4.
- Case 2: Simplifying the ratio 12:18, a student may not recognize that both numbers have a common factor of 6, resulting in an incorrect simplification, instead of dividing both numbers by 6 to get the correct simplification of 2:3.
- Case 3: Simplifying the ratio 24:30, a student may simplify it to 12:15, but not further simplify it to its simplest form of 4:5."
1919,Believes that a fractional index also means you need to find the reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to fractional indices, which can be confusing, especially if they have a prior understanding of negative indices as indicating the need to find a reciprocal. For instance, students may have learned that a negative index, such as x^-2, means taking the reciprocal of x squared (1/x^2). However, when they encounter fractional indices, like x^(1/2), some students may incorrectly assume that the fractional part also implies finding the reciprocal, rather than realizing it represents taking a root.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying expressions with fractional indices, such as x^(1/3) or (2x)^(3/4).
- Solving equations that involve fractional indices, like x^(1/2) = 4 or (x^2)^(1/3) = 2.
- Differentiating or integrating functions with fractional indices in calculus, such as finding the derivative of x^(3/2) or the integral of x^(2/3).
- Interpreting and applying mathematical models involving fractional indices in real-world problems, such as calculating the surface area of a sphere (4πr^2) and misinterpreting the power of r if it was fractional."
1920,Forgotten that anything to the power of 0 equals 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overlook or forget the fundamental rule in mathematics that any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 equals 1. This rule is a basic property of exponents and is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations. However, students might mistakenly think that a number raised to the power of 0 is equal to 0 or the number itself, rather than 1.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Simplifying expressions: When simplifying expressions with exponents, students might forget to apply the rule that anything to the power of 0 equals 1, leading to incorrect simplifications. For example, in the expression 2x^0, students might think the answer is 0 or 2, rather than 1 * 2 = 2.

- Solving equations: When solving equations with exponents, students might overlook the fact that a number raised to the power of 0 equals 1, leading to incorrect solutions. For example, in the equation x^0 = ?, students might answer 0 or x, rather than 1.

- Evaluating numerical expressions: When evaluating numerical expressions with exponents, students might forget to apply the rule that anything to the power of 0 equals 1. For example, when evaluating the expression 5^0, students might think the answer is 0 or 5, rather than 1."
1921,Does not understand laws of indices,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the rules governing the use of indices (exponents) in mathematics. They may incorrectly apply or combine the laws of indices, which can lead to errors in calculations and problem-solving.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions with multiple indices, such as 2^3 × 2^4, students may not know whether to add or multiply the indices.
- When dealing with negative indices, students might not understand that a^-n is equal to 1/a^n.
- When working with fractional indices, such as 2^(1/2) or 2^(3/4), students may become confused about how to apply the laws of indices.
- When solving problems involving multiple operations with indices, such as 2^3 × 3^2 / 4^1, students may struggle to apply the correct order of operations.
- When simplifying expressions with indices that have the same base but different exponents, such as 2^3 + 2^4, students might not know how to combine the terms correctly."
1922,Gets the dividend and divisor the wrong way round when doing long division,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the roles of the dividend and divisor in a long division problem. In long division, the dividend is the number being divided, while the divisor is the number by which we are dividing. When students get these two numbers mixed up, they will end up dividing the wrong number by the other, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if the problem is 48 ÷ 6, students with this misconception may write 6 as the dividend and 48 as the divisor, resulting in an incorrect calculation.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are first introduced to long division and struggle to understand the concept.
- When the dividend and divisor are close in value, making it harder to determine which is which (e.g., 24 ÷ 20).
- When students are working with word problems and misinterpret the context, leading to a reversal of the dividend and divisor (e.g., ""Tom has 18 cookies to share among 3 friends"" might be incorrectly set up as 3 ÷ 18).
- When students are working with multi-digit numbers and lose track of which number is the dividend and which is the divisor (e.g., 432 ÷ 12)."
1923,Thinks a greater range means more consistent data,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of range in data analysis. They may believe that a greater range in a dataset indicates that the data is more consistent or has less variability. However, the range actually measures the difference between the largest and smallest values in the dataset, which means a greater range typically indicates more spread out or variable data. Students with this misconception may incorrectly interpret a dataset with a large range as being more consistent or reliable than one with a smaller range.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Comparing the consistency of exam scores between two classes. If one class has scores ranging from 40 to 90 and the other from 70 to 80, a student with this misconception may think the first class has more consistent scores due to the larger range.
- Case 2: Analyzing the variability of temperatures in different cities. A student may believe that a city with temperatures ranging from -10°C to 30°C has more consistent temperatures than a city with temperatures ranging from 10°C to 20°C.
- Case 3: Evaluating the performance of athletes in a competition. A student may incorrectly conclude that an athlete with more variable scores (e.g., golf scores ranging from 70 to 100) is more consistent than an athlete with more consistent scores (e.g., golf scores ranging from 75 to 85)."
1924,Believes that a number divided by itself equals 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of division. They may think that dividing a number by itself means ""getting rid of"" the number, resulting in zero. This may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between division and fractions, or the concept of identity elements in mathematics. For instance, students might think that if you have 6 cookies and you divide them among 6 people, there will be no cookies left, hence 6 ÷ 6 = 0.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying fractions, students might think that 4 ÷ 4 = 0 instead of 1.
- When solving simple division problems, such as 8 ÷ 8 or 2 ÷ 2, students may write 0 as the answer.
- When solving algebraic equations, such as x ÷ x, students might cancel out the x's and write 0 instead of 1.
- When working with equivalent ratios, students may think that a ratio of 5:5 is equal to 0:1 instead of 1:1."
1925,Believes nth term rules for patterns must be given in standard an + b form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of nth term rules in algebra, particularly when dealing with linear sequences. They may assume that the nth term rule must always be expressed in the standard form of an + b, where 'a' is the common difference and 'b' is the first term. This misconception leads students to believe that any other form of expression is incorrect or invalid.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to find the nth term rule for a sequence with a common difference that is not immediately apparent, they may struggle to express it in the standard an + b form and assume that it cannot be represented by an nth term rule.
* When dealing with sequences that have a non-linear or non-constant common difference, students may insist on trying to force the nth term rule into the standard an + b form, rather than exploring alternative expressions.
* When students are presented with a sequence that has a simple nth term rule, but it is not in the standard an + b form (e.g., 2n - 1), they may incorrectly assume that it is not a valid nth term rule."
1926,"Believes you use the half of the base length to find the area of an isosceles triangle, following using it to find the perpendicular height","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to find the area of an isosceles triangle, they need to use half of the base length and then use this value to calculate the perpendicular height. They may think that because an isosceles triangle has two equal sides, the base needs to be halved before being used in the area calculation. They might also incorrectly assume that this halved base length is then used to determine the perpendicular height, rather than understanding that the height is a separate measurement that can be found using other methods.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of an isosceles triangle with a given base length and the height is not explicitly provided.
- When the height of the triangle needs to be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, and the student mistakenly uses the halved base length in the calculation.
- When comparing the areas of different isosceles triangles, and the student incorrectly applies the halved base length method to find the area, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- When solving problems involving the area of isosceles triangles in real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, and the student's misconception leads to inaccurate calculations."
1927,Does not know the definition of a prism,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to define or identify a prism correctly. A prism is a three-dimensional solid object with two identical faces that are parallel and oriented in the same direction, connected by a set of rectangular faces. However, students with this misconception may think that any three-dimensional shape with straight edges is a prism, or they may confuse prisms with other shapes, such as pyramids or cylinders.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are shown a picture of a rectangular solid and asked to identify it, they may incorrectly call it a prism without understanding the specific properties that make it a prism.
- When students are given a set of blocks or other materials to build a prism, they may construct a shape that does not meet the definition of a prism, such as a shape with non-parallel bases.
- When students are asked to describe the properties of a prism, they may list characteristics that are not unique to prisms, such as ""it has straight edges"" or ""it is a 3D shape"", without mentioning the key feature of two identical parallel faces.
- When students are shown a real-life example of a prism, such as a cardboard box, they may not recognize it as a prism because they do not understand the definition."
1928,Mixes up the numerator and denominator,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the positions of the numerator and denominator in a fraction, leading to an incorrect representation of the proportion or ratio. For example, if a pizza has 3 slices eaten out of 8, a student with this misconception might write the fraction as 8/3 instead of 3/8.

This misconception can manifest in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying fractions: A student might simplify the fraction 6/8 as 8/6 or even 8/3, instead of the correct simplification of 3/4.
- When comparing fractions: Students might incorrectly compare the sizes of fractions by comparing the numerators and denominators separately, rather than considering the relationship between them. For instance, they might think that 2/3 is smaller than 3/2 because 2 is smaller than 3.
- When performing operations with fractions: This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations when adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing fractions. For example, a student might add 1/4 and 1/6 by adding the numerators and denominators separately, resulting in 2/10 instead of the correct answer of 5/12.
- When interpreting real-world situations: Students might misinterpret data or situations involving fractions, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or understanding statistical data."
1929,Does not understand the concept of inverse operations in algebra,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that certain algebraic operations have inverses that ""undo"" each other. In other words, they struggle to understand that addition and subtraction, multiplication and division, are inverse operations that can be used to solve equations and manipulate expressions. 

For example, when solving for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 5, a student with this misconception may not realize that subtracting 3 from both sides is the inverse operation of adding 3, which allows them to isolate the term with the variable. Similarly, when simplifying an expression like (3x)(1/3), they may not recognize that multiplying by 1/3 is the inverse operation of multiplying by 3, which can simplify the expression.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Not being able to solve simple linear equations, like 2x + 2 = 6, because they don't know how to ""get rid"" of the constant term.
* Struggling to simplify expressions like (2x)(1/2) or (x + 2) - 2.
* Having trouble understanding the concept of equivalent ratios and proportions, which rely heavily on inverse operations.
* Difficulty solving problems that involve more complex equations, like x/2 + 3 = 5, where inverse operations are necessary to isolate the variable."
1930,Believes it's ok to change the scale on an axis for the negative values,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with graphs that involve negative values. They might believe that it's acceptable to alter the scale on an axis (usually the y-axis) to accommodate the negative values. This can include using a different scale for the negative section of the axis or compressing/stretching the scale to fit the data. The misconception often stems from a lack of understanding about the importance of maintaining a consistent scale on an axis.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Graphing a function with negative values, such as y = x^2 - 4, and using a different scale for the negative section of the y-axis.
- Plotting temperature data with both positive and negative values, and compressing the scale for the negative temperatures.
- Creating a bar graph with both positive and negative values, and using a different scale for the negative section of the y-axis.
- Interpreting a graph with a non-linear scale, such as a logarithmic scale, and incorrectly assuming it's okay to change the scale for the negative values."
1931,Believes the opposite side is where the adjacent side is in a right angled triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to trigonometry in right-angled triangles. They mistakenly believe that the opposite side of an angle is the side adjacent to it, and vice versa. This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the definitions of the terms ""opposite"", ""adjacent"", and ""hypotenuse"" in the context of right-angled triangles.

In a right-angled triangle, the opposite side of an angle is the side that is across from it, not next to it. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly identify the adjacent side, which is the side next to the angle, as the opposite side. This can lead to errors in calculating trigonometric ratios such as sine, cosine, and tangent.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

* When identifying the opposite and adjacent sides of an angle in a right-angled triangle.
* When calculating trigonometric ratios such as sin(A), cos(A), and tan(A) in a right-angled triangle.
* When solving problems involving right-angled triangles, such as finding the length of a side or the size of an angle.
* When applying trigonometric concepts to real-world problems, such as finding the height of a building or the distance to a ship at sea."
1932,Counts partial symbols as if they were whole on pictograms,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with pictograms, which are graphical representations of data that use symbols or pictures to represent quantities. Students with this misconception tend to count partial symbols as if they were whole, rather than understanding that a partial symbol represents only a fraction of the quantity. For example, if a pictogram uses a symbol to represent 5 units, a student with this misconception might count a half-symbol as 5 units rather than 2.5 units.

This misconception can lead to inaccurate interpretations of data and incorrect calculations. It can occur in various situations, such as:

- When reading and interpreting pictograms in a mathematics textbook or on a graph.
- When creating their own pictograms to represent data and incorrectly counting partial symbols.
- When comparing data sets represented by pictograms and misinterpreting the quantities being represented.
- When calculating totals or averages from data represented by pictograms and counting partial symbols as whole."
1933,Believes that the reciprocal of a number is equal to that number (1/x = x),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reciprocals. They may think that taking the reciprocal of a number simply means writing the same number again, rather than understanding that the reciprocal is actually the multiplicative inverse of the number, i.e., 1 divided by that number. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the relationship between numbers and their multiplicative inverses.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Simplifying fractions: A student may think that the reciprocal of 2 is 2, rather than 1/2.
- Dividing fractions: A student may incorrectly simplify a division problem like 1/2 ÷ 2 as 1/2 × 2, thinking that the reciprocal of 2 is 2.
- Graphing functions: When graphing a function like y = 1/x, a student may incorrectly assume that the graph will be a straight line where y = x, rather than a hyperbola.
- Solving equations: In an equation like x + 1/x = 2, a student may incorrectly substitute x for 1/x, leading to an incorrect solution."
1934,Multiplied by the scale factor rather than divided in direct proportion problems,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with direct proportion problems, particularly when scaling quantities up or down. In direct proportion, as one quantity increases, the other quantity also increases at a constant rate. However, when scaling down, students often mistakenly multiply by the scale factor instead of dividing. This results in an incorrect answer that is larger than expected.

This misconception can be attributed to students' over-reliance on multiplication as the primary operation in scaling problems, or a lack of understanding of the relationship between scaling up and scaling down. When scaling up, multiplication is indeed used, but when scaling down, division is necessary to achieve the correct proportion.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- A recipe for 8 people needs to be scaled down for 2 people. If the original recipe requires 400g of flour, a student may multiply 400g by 1/4 (the scale factor), instead of dividing 400g by 4.
- A photograph is being enlarged from a width of 10cm to 5cm. A student may multiply the original width by 1/2, instead of dividing by 2, to find the new width.
- A group of friends want to share some money in the ratio of their ages. If they are scaling down the amount of money to be shared, a student may multiply the original amount by the scale factor instead of dividing it."
1935,"Divides length of original by length of image to find scale factor, rather than image by original.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the scale factor between two similar figures, such as shapes or objects. The scale factor is the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding sides of the two figures. However, students with this misconception mistakenly believe that the scale factor is found by dividing the length of the original figure by the length of the image (or scaled figure), rather than the other way around.

This can be attributed to a misunderstanding of the concept of scaling and proportions. When an object is scaled up or down, its dimensions change, but the ratio of its corresponding sides remains the same. To find the scale factor, one needs to compare the lengths of the corresponding sides of the two figures, but students with this misconception swap the order of the comparison.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the scale factor of two similar triangles, a student may divide the length of the original triangle's side by the length of the corresponding side of the scaled triangle.
- When determining the scale factor of a map to the actual distance, a student may divide the distance on the map by the actual distance.
- When comparing the sizes of two similar shapes, a student may divide the length of the original shape by the length of the scaled shape to find the scale factor."
1936,Believes the integer can be written before or after the surd eg. 3√2 = √2 3,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying integers with surds. They believe that the order of writing the integer and the surd does not affect the result, and that 3√2 and √2 3 are equivalent expressions. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication with surds, or a misunderstanding of the notation used to represent surds.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* Simplifying expressions involving surds, e.g. 2√3 × 4 = ?
* Adding or subtracting expressions involving surds, e.g. 3√2 + √2 4 = ?
* Solving equations involving surds, e.g. 2√x = 6, where students may write the solution as √x 3 instead of 3√x."
1937,Believes subtracting a positive number from a negative number makes the answer less negative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of subtraction as the addition of the additive inverse. They may think that subtracting a positive number from a negative number will always make the answer less negative, as if they are simply 'taking away' the positive value. However, this thinking ignores the fact that subtracting a positive number is equivalent to adding its negative counterpart.

For example, in cases such as:

- Case 1: -3 - 2, where students might think the answer is less negative because they're subtracting a positive 2.
- Case 2: -5 - 1, where students may believe the answer will be closer to zero because they're subtracting a small positive number.
- Case 3: Comparing -2 - 3 and -2 - 1, where students might think that -2 - 1 is less negative than -2 - 3, without understanding the actual calculation."
1938,Ignores zeros when giving the value of an integer,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard the zeros in a number, especially when reading or writing multi-digit integers. They may misinterpret the place value of digits, failing to recognize the significance of zeros in the tens, hundreds, or thousands places. As a result, they may read or write numbers incorrectly, omitting the zeros or shifting the digits to incorrect positions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading a number like 100, a student might say ""one"" instead of ""one hundred.""
- When writing the number 1000, a student might write ""1"" instead of ""1000.""
- When comparing numbers like 10 and 100, a student might think they are the same value.
- When performing arithmetic operations, such as 100 + 10, a student might calculate the answer as 11 instead of 110.
- When rounding numbers, a student might round 109 to 1 instead of 100."
1939,Difficulty with translating a mathematical answer into a real world context,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to connect mathematical solutions to real-life scenarios. They might be able to solve a mathematical problem, but fail to understand what the solution means in the context of the problem. This can lead to misinterpretation of results or providing answers that are mathematically correct but practically meaningless. Students may focus too much on the mathematical operations and lose sight of the real-world implications.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A problem asks how many buses are needed to transport 240 students, given that each bus can hold 40 students. A student might answer ""6"" without realizing that this means 6 buses are needed in real life to transport all the students.

2. In a recipe, a student is asked to scale up the ingredients for a cake to serve 18 people instead of 6. They might calculate the new amount of flour needed as 3 times the original amount but not understand that this means they need to use 3 times more flour in real life.

3. A student is asked to calculate the cost of buying 5 items at $8 each, including a 10% discount. They might calculate the total cost as $40 - $4 = $36 but not understand that this means they will actually have to pay $36 in real life.

4. In a problem about a water tank, a student is asked to calculate how long it will take to fill the tank at a certain rate. They might answer ""5 hours"" without realizing that this means it will take 5 real hours to fill the tank.

5. A student is asked to calculate the area of a room in square meters. They might answer ""12 square meters"" without understanding that this means the room is actually 12 square meters in size."
1940,Believes a kite has bisecting diagonals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the properties of certain quadrilaterals to a kite, believing that a kite's diagonals must bisect each other. However, this is not necessarily true for a kite. A kite does have two pairs of adjacent sides of equal length, but this does not imply that its diagonals bisect each other. The diagonals of a kite do intersect at right angles, but they do not necessarily bisect each other.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to the properties of different quadrilaterals, such as kites, rhombuses, and squares, and mistakenly apply the properties of one to another.
- When students are asked to identify the properties of a given kite and mistakenly assume that the diagonals bisect each other.
- When students are solving problems involving the area or perimeter of a kite and incorrectly apply the properties of bisecting diagonals.
- When students are drawing or constructing kites and mistakenly draw the diagonals as bisecting each other."
1941,"Confuses the order of operations, believes subtraction comes before multiplication ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully familiar with the order of operations rule, often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) or PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and Addition and Subtraction). They incorrectly assume that subtraction should be performed before multiplication, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the conventional order or because they have not practiced applying it in various mathematical expressions.

This misconception can lead to errors when evaluating expressions that involve multiple operations. For example:

Case 1: Evaluating the expression 3 × 2 - 4, a student with this misconception might subtract 4 from 2 first, resulting in -2, and then multiply 3 by -2 to get -6, instead of the correct result.

Case 2: When solving the expression 12 - 3 × 2, the student might subtract 3 from 12 first, resulting in 9, and then multiply 9 by 2 to get 18, instead of following the correct order of operations.

Case 3: In an algebraic expression like 2x - 5 × 3, the student might subtract 5 from 2x first and then multiply the result by 3, instead of following the correct order of operations."
1942,Chooses the wrong 3 letters to describe an angle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to identify and describe angles using three-letter notations. In geometry, angles are often labeled using three letters, with the vertex of the angle in the middle. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly select the three letters, often choosing letters that do not represent the vertex of the angle or incorrectly ordering the letters.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When labeling angles in a diagram, a student may choose three letters that are not in the correct order (e.g., choosing A-C-B instead of B-A-C).
- When describing an angle in a triangle, a student may select two letters that represent the sides of the triangle instead of the vertex and one side (e.g., choosing A-B-C when the correct label is B-A-C or A-C-B).
- When identifying corresponding angles, a student may incorrectly match the letters, leading to incorrect conclusions about the angles' relationships."
1943,Includes the intersection of a Venn diagram when asked to find the value of a set only,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the value or elements of a specific set in a Venn diagram, but they incorrectly include the elements that are in the intersection of the sets. This means that they are counting the elements that belong to both sets twice, once as part of each individual set and again as part of the intersection. 

This misconception occurs when students don't fully understand the concept of sets and how to read Venn diagrams, leading them to misinterpret the relationships between the sets.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When finding the total number of elements in a single set, students may include the elements that are in the intersection with another set.
- When asked to list the elements of a specific set, students may include elements that are also in the intersection with another set.
- When solving problems that involve finding the union or difference of sets, students may incorrectly include the elements in the intersection, leading to incorrect answers."
1944,Confuses the radius with the radius squared in the equation of a circle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with the equation of a circle, which is typically given by (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius. Students may incorrectly substitute the value of the radius (r) instead of the radius squared (r^2) into the equation, or vice versa. This can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions about the properties of the circle.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the equation of a circle given its center and radius, students may write (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r instead of (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.
- When solving problems involving the area of a circle, students may incorrectly use the formula A = πr instead of A = πr^2.
- When determining the distance from the center of a circle to a point on the circle, students may incorrectly use the radius squared instead of the radius.
- When graphing circles, students may incorrectly plot points using the radius instead of the radius squared, resulting in an incorrect graph."
1945,Believes an upward slope on a distance-time graph means the movement has stopped,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misinterpret the meaning of the slope on a distance-time graph. They mistakenly believe that an upward slope indicates that the movement has stopped, possibly because they associate the upward direction with a ""halt"" or a ""pause."" However, the slope on a distance-time graph actually represents the rate at which the distance is changing, not the state of motion.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is analyzing the motion of a car on a distance-time graph. The graph shows an upward slope, and the student concludes that the car has stopped moving, when in fact, the car is actually moving at a constant speed.

- Case 2: A student is comparing the motion of two objects on separate distance-time graphs. One graph shows a horizontal line, and the other shows an upward slope. The student incorrectly concludes that the object with the upward slope is stationary, while the object with the horizontal line is moving.

- Case 3: A student is asked to describe the motion of an object based on its distance-time graph. The graph shows an upward slope followed by a horizontal line. The student mistakenly believes that the object stopped moving during the upward slope and then started moving again when the graph became horizontal.

- Case 4: A student is working on a problem that involves interpreting the motion of an object on a distance-time graph. The graph shows an upward slope, and the student is asked to determine the object's speed. The student incorrectly assumes that the object is stationary and therefore has a speed of zero."
1946,Believes numbers are divisible by numbers which sum to their factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that if the sum of two or more numbers equals one of the factors of a given number, then that number is divisible by those numbers. For example, a student might think that the number 12 is divisible by 3 and 4 simply because 3 + 4 = 7 is not true but 3 + 3 = 6 and 6 is a factor of 12, but 3 + 4 doesn't equal a factor of 12, however 2 + 6 = 8 and 3 + 4 doesn't equal 8 but 2 + 6 does equal 8 which is not a factor of 12, however, this is still incorrect as this thinking would lead to the incorrect conclusion that 12 is divisible by 2 + 6 which is 8 which is not true.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student thinks 18 is divisible by 3 + 6 because 3 + 6 = 9, and 9 is a factor of 18.
2. A student believes 24 is divisible by 4 + 8 because 4 + 8 = 12, and 12 is a factor of 24.
3. A student thinks 20 is divisible by 4 + 5 because 4 + 5 = 9, and although 9 is not a factor of 20, they still proceed with the incorrect assumption."
1947,Writes more than three repeated symbols next to each other in Roman numerals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the rules governing Roman numerals. In Roman numerals, it's a standard rule that the same symbol cannot be repeated more than three times in a row. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly write the same symbol four or more times consecutively. This misunderstanding is likely due to the students' lack of familiarity with the conventions and patterns used in the Roman numeral system.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When writing the number 4, a student may incorrectly write IIII instead of IV.
- When writing the number 9, a student may incorrectly write VIIII instead of IX.
- When writing the number 40, a student may incorrectly write XXXX instead of XL.
- When writing the number 90, a student may incorrectly write LXXXX instead of XC."
1948,Believes the inverse of square rooting is doubling,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the inverse operation of taking the square root of a number is doubling the number, rather than squaring it. In other words, they think that if the square root of a number is an operation that finds a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number, then the inverse operation would be to multiply the number by 2, rather than multiplying it by itself.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying expressions, like √x, students might think the inverse is 2x.
- When solving equations, like √x = 4, students might think the solution is x = 8 (doubling 4) rather than x = 16 (squaring 4).
- When working with functions, like f(x) = √x, students might think the inverse function is f^(-1)(x) = 2x rather than f^(-1)(x) = x^2."
1949,"Believes reflection in y=-x switches the signs of the coordinates, but not their numbers","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of reflecting points or shapes across the line y = -x. They may correctly understand that a reflection in y = x switches the x and y coordinates, but when it comes to reflecting across y = -x, they incorrectly assume that only the signs of the coordinates are switched, not the numbers themselves.

For example, if a point (3, 4) is reflected across y = -x, a student with this misconception may think that the reflected point is (-3, -4) instead of (-4, -3). They fail to recognize that the x and y coordinates are swapped in addition to the change in sign.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When graphing functions and reflecting them across y = -x to explore symmetry.
- In geometry, when reflecting shapes across y = -x to create new shapes or explore congruence.
- In coordinate geometry, when finding the coordinates of reflected points across y = -x."
1950,forgets to include the common factors when calculating the lowest common multiple,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers, but they only consider the unique factors of each number and forget to include the common factors. The students may list out the multiples of each number and identify some common multiples but will make errors when writing out the LCM as they won't include the common factors in the final answer. They may believe that the LCM only consists of the factors that are unique to each number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the LCM of 12 and 18, the student might list the multiples of each number (12: 12, 24, 36, 48...; 18: 18, 36, 54, 72...) and identify 36 as a common multiple, but write the LCM as 2 x 3 x 3 x 2 instead of 2 x 2 x 3 x 3.
- Calculating the LCM of 15 and 20, the student may list the factors of each number (15: 3 x 5; 20: 2 x 2 x 5) and forget to include the common factor of 5 in the LCM.
- Finding the LCM of 24 and 30, the student might identify the unique factors of each number (24: 2 x 2 x 2 x 3; 30: 2 x 3 x 5) but forget to include the common factors of 2 and 3 in the LCM."
1951, Does not believe that a negative multiple of a vector is in the opposite direction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the concept of scalar multiplication of vectors, specifically when the scalar is negative. They may believe that multiplying a vector by a negative number only changes its magnitude, but not its direction. As a result, they fail to recognize that a negative multiple of a vector actually reverses its direction.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to graphically represent the result of multiplying a vector by a negative scalar, they may draw the resulting vector in the same direction as the original vector.
- When solving problems involving vector addition or subtraction, students may incorrectly assume that the direction of the resulting vector is the same as the original vectors, even if one of the vectors is multiplied by a negative scalar.
- In problems involving velocity or force vectors, students may incorrectly assume that a negative multiple of the vector only changes its magnitude, but not its direction, leading to incorrect conclusions about the direction of motion or force.
- When working with vector equations, students may incorrectly simplify expressions involving negative multiples of vectors, leading to incorrect solutions."
1952,Confuses class width and frequency when calculating frequency density,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concepts of class width and frequency in the context of calculating frequency density in statistics. Frequency density is calculated as the frequency of a class divided by the class width. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly interchange the class width and frequency, leading to incorrect calculations. They may either divide the class width by the frequency or use the frequency as the divisor when it should be the class width.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the frequency density of a dataset and they are given a table or graph with class intervals and corresponding frequencies.
- When students are required to construct a histogram and calculate the frequency density to determine the height of each bar in the histogram.
- When students are comparing the distribution of different datasets and need to calculate frequency densities to make informed decisions.
- When students are solving problems involving grouped data and need to calculate the mean or median, which requires calculating the frequency density first."
1953,Makes an assumption about line segments being equal within a shape,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that certain line segments within a shape are equal in length, often due to the shape's appearance or symmetry. For example, they might assume that all sides of a shape are equal just because it looks symmetrical or has some similar features. This misconception can lead to incorrect conclusions and calculations when dealing with various shapes in geometry.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. In an isosceles triangle, a student assumes that the base is equal to the two congruent sides because it looks symmetrical.
2. When drawing a kite, a student assumes that the two pairs of adjacent sides are equal in length because they look the same.
3. A student assumes that all sides of a hexagon are equal because it has six sides and looks symmetrical.
4. In a quadrilateral, a student assumes that the opposite sides are equal in length just because they are parallel to each other.
5. A student assumes that the radii of a circle are equal to the diameter because they are all connected to the center of the circle."
1954,Divides when converting to a smaller unit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that when converting a measurement from a larger unit to a smaller unit, they need to divide the value. For example, when converting 1 kilogram to grams, they might think that since grams are smaller than kilograms, they should divide 1 by a certain number to get the answer. However, the correct operation to perform is actually multiplication.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting 2 liters to milliliters: A student might think that since milliliters are smaller than liters, they should divide 2 by 1000 instead of multiplying it by 1000.
- Converting 5 meters to centimeters: A student might think that since centimeters are smaller than meters, they should divide 5 by 100 instead of multiplying it by 100.
- Converting 3 kilograms to grams: A student might think that since grams are smaller than kilograms, they should divide 3 by 1000 instead of multiplying it by 1000."
1955,Thinks that a percentage can be converted to a fraction using a denominator of 10 ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a percentage to a fraction always involves using a denominator of 10, simply because the word ""percent"" means ""per 100"" but they get confused with the ""per 10"" concept as it's easier. They incorrectly assume that percentages can be directly converted to fractions by dividing by 10 instead of 100. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to convert 25% to a fraction, a student might answer 2.5/10 instead of 25/100 or 1/4.
- When solving a problem that involves finding a percentage of a quantity, a student might calculate 15% of 200 as 15/10 x 200 instead of 15/100 x 200.
- When comparing percentages, a student might think that 30% is equal to 3/10 instead of 30/100 or 3/10 is actually 30%."
1956,Doubles side length for similar shape instead of using correct scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with similar shapes, which are shapes that have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Students often mistakenly believe that to find the length of a side of a similar shape, they simply need to double the length of the corresponding side of the original shape. However, this is incorrect because the relationship between the sides of similar shapes is determined by a scale factor, not just a simple doubling.

For example, if a shape is enlarged by a scale factor of 3, the length of each side will be multiplied by 3, not just doubled. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the concept of similarity.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Enlarging a shape by a specific scale factor, e.g. ""If the length of a side of a square is 5cm and it is enlarged by a scale factor of 2.5, what is the new length of the side?""
- Finding the length of a side of a similar shape, e.g. ""If two triangles are similar and the length of a side of the smaller triangle is 6cm, what is the length of the corresponding side of the larger triangle if it is twice as big?""
- Solving problems involving the scale factor of similar shapes, e.g. ""A model of a building is 1:50 scale. If the height of the model is 20cm, what is the height of the actual building?"""
1957,"Reads 10,000 as 1000","Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of place value, particularly with large numbers. They may struggle to recognize the correct placement of zeros in a number, leading them to misread 10,000 as 1000. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the relationships between hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands, or an inability to visualize the number in a way that accurately represents its value.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading numbers aloud, a student may say ""one thousand"" instead of ""ten thousand"" when presented with the number 10,000.
- When writing numbers, a student may write 1000 instead of 10,000, or vice versa.
- When solving math problems, a student may incorrectly calculate or compare numbers due to their misunderstanding of the value of 10,000.
- When working with real-world examples, such as money or measurements, a student may misinterpret 10,000 as 1000, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions."
1958,"Believes the smaller number is always subtracted from the larger, regardless of the order of the calculation","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of subtraction and believe that the smaller number must always be subtracted from the larger number, regardless of the order in which the numbers are presented in the calculation. This can lead to incorrect calculations, as students may swap the numbers around to ensure the smaller number is being subtracted from the larger one.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: 5 - 8 = ? (Student may answer 3, thinking 8 - 5 = 3, because they subtracted the smaller number from the larger)
- Case 2: 12 - 25 = ? (Student may answer 13, thinking 25 - 12 = 13, because they subtracted the smaller number from the larger)
- Case 3: A basket contains 15 apples, and 20 apples are taken away. How many apples are left? (Student may answer 5, thinking 20 - 15 = 5, because they subtracted the smaller number from the larger)"
1959,Does not know that a solid is a 3D shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to distinguish between two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) shapes. They may think that all shapes are flat and do not understand that solids have a third dimension, which is depth or height. This can be due to a lack of hands-on experience with 3D objects or a misunderstanding of the terminology used to describe shapes.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to identify examples of solids in real-life objects, students may only mention 2D shapes such as squares or circles.
* When given a diagram of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a sphere, students may refer to it as a 2D shape.
* When asked to describe the properties of a solid, students may only mention the number of sides or edges, without considering the depth or height of the shape.
* When tasked with creating a 3D model using blocks or other materials, students may build a flat structure instead of a solid shape.
* When solving problems involving volume or surface area, students may struggle to visualize the 3D shape and calculate the correct answer."
1960,Does not realise that the sum of the two shorter sides must be greater than the third side for it to be a possible triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to determine whether a set of given side lengths can form a valid triangle. They may assume that as long as the three sides are given, a triangle can be formed, without considering the relationship between the lengths of the sides. They may not understand that if the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sides is not greater than the length of the third side, it would not be possible to construct a triangle with those side lengths, as the two shorter sides would not be able to ""reach"" each other to form a closed shape.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Students are given the lengths of three sides, such as 3cm, 4cm, and 9cm, and are asked to determine whether a triangle can be formed with these side lengths. They may incorrectly assume that a triangle can be formed without checking the relationship between the side lengths.
- Case 2: Students are asked to construct a triangle with specific side lengths, such as 5cm, 6cm, and 12cm. They may attempt to construct the triangle without realizing that it is not possible due to the sum of the two shorter sides not being greater than the third side.
- Case 3: Students are given a set of side lengths, such as 2cm, 3cm, and 6cm, and are asked to classify the type of triangle that can be formed (e.g. equilateral, isosceles, scalene). They may incorrectly assume that a triangle can be formed and attempt to classify it without checking the validity of the side lengths."
1961,Fails to identify mirror line,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to recognize the line of symmetry or mirror line in a given shape or figure. They may have difficulty understanding that the mirror line is an imaginary line that divides a shape into two identical halves, where one half is a mirror image of the other. Students may mistakenly identify a line that is not the actual mirror line, or they may not be able to find the mirror line at all.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the mirror line in a symmetrical shape, such as a square or a triangle.
- When given a shape with multiple lines of symmetry, students may become confused and fail to identify the correct mirror line.
- When dealing with irregular shapes, students may struggle to find the mirror line due to the shape's lack of obvious symmetry.
- When asked to draw the mirror image of a shape, students may not accurately reflect the shape across the mirror line.
- When working with real-world examples, such as reflections in water or mirrors, students may not be able to identify the mirror line in the reflection."
1962,Doesn't take into account cost when calculating expected return/profit,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students calculate the expected return or profit from a situation without considering the costs associated with it. They may only focus on the revenue generated, ignoring the expenses, investments, or other expenditures that are necessary to achieve that revenue. As a result, their calculations may show an unrealistically high expected return, leading to inaccurate conclusions.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: A student is calculating the expected profit from selling lemonade at a school event. They estimate the revenue from selling 100 cups of lemonade at $2 each but fail to consider the cost of ingredients, cups, and other expenses.

- Case 2: A student is evaluating the potential return on investment (ROI) of buying and selling stocks. They calculate the expected gain from selling the stocks at a higher price but neglect to account for brokerage fees, taxes, and other transaction costs.

- Case 3: A student is determining the expected profit from running a school bake sale. They estimate the revenue from selling baked goods but overlook the costs of ingredients, baking supplies, and venue rental.

In each of these cases, the student's failure to account for costs leads to an inaccurate calculation of the expected return or profit, which can result in poor decision-making and unrealistic expectations."
1963,Performs subtraction right to left if priority order means doing a calculation to the right first,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of order of operations, specifically the idea of working from left to right. They may believe that when performing subtraction operations, they should start from the rightmost operation and work their way left, rather than following the correct order of operations (e.g., BIDMAS/BODMAS: Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction). 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When subtracting multiple numbers in a single expression, such as 10 - 3 - 2.
- When dealing with expressions that involve multiple operations, such as 15 - 5 + 2 - 1.
- When working with word problems that require multiple subtractions, such as ""Tom has 25 pencils, gives 5 to his friend, and then gives 3 more to his sister. How many pencils does Tom have left?"""
1964,Estimates obtuse angles as 90 degrees or less,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of obtuse angles and their measurements. An obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees. However, students with this misconception tend to perceive obtuse angles as being smaller than they actually are, often estimating them to be 90 degrees or less. This could be due to a lack of exposure to various angle measurements, difficulty visualizing angles, or an incomplete understanding of the angle classification system (acute, right, obtuse, and straight).

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When drawing or identifying obtuse angles in geometric shapes, students may label an obtuse angle as 90 degrees or an acute angle.
2. When measuring angles using a protractor, students may misread the measurement and record an obtuse angle as a smaller angle.
3. In real-life situations, such as building design or construction, students may underestimate the size of an obtuse angle, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
4. In problems involving angle sums in triangles or other polygons, students may incorrectly assume an obtuse angle is smaller, affecting their calculations and answers."
1965,Thinks you need to just add a % sign to a decimal to convert to a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that converting a decimal to a percentage simply involves adding a percentage sign (%) to the decimal value, without understanding the actual conversion process. They may think that, for example, 0.5 becomes 0.5% instead of correctly converting it to 50%. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of comprehension of the relationship between decimals and percentages or a failure to recognize that percentages represent values out of 100.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting a decimal to a percentage in a math problem, such as converting 0.25 to a percentage (students might write 0.25% instead of 25%).
- In real-world applications, such as calculating discounts or interest rates, where students might incorrectly add a percentage sign to a decimal value without performing the necessary conversion.
- When interpreting data or statistics, such as reading graphs or charts that display percentages, and students mistakenly add a percentage sign to a decimal value without converting it correctly."
1966,Finds the median instead of the mean,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the average of a set of numbers, but instead of adding up all the numbers and dividing by the total count, they arrange the numbers in order and find the middle value, which is actually the median. This shows a misunderstanding of the difference between the mean and median, which are both measures of central tendency but are calculated in different ways.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with a set of exam scores and being asked to find the average score, the student may arrange the scores in order and find the middle score, thinking that is the average.
- When given a list of heights of students in the class and asked to find the average height, the student may again arrange the heights in order and find the middle height, instead of adding up all the heights and dividing by the total number of students.
- In a data analysis problem, the student may be given a set of numbers representing the number of books read by each student in a class, and when asked to find the average number of books read, they may find the median instead of the mean."
1967,Counts a side length more than once when counting perimeter due to not marking a starting point,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the perimeter of a shape, but they fail to designate a starting point, leading to counting a side length multiple times. As a result, they end up with an incorrect total perimeter. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of perimeter as a total distance around a shape, and not realizing that each side should only be counted once.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is asked to find the perimeter of a rectangle with a length of 5 units and a width of 3 units. Without marking a starting point, they start counting from one corner and count the length twice, resulting in an incorrect perimeter of 16 units instead of 16 (2 x 5 + 2 x 3 = 16, correct perimeter).

2. A student is given a diagram of a pentagon with side lengths labeled. Without choosing a starting point, they count the sides in a haphazard manner, accidentally counting one side twice, leading to an incorrect perimeter.

3. A student is tasked with finding the perimeter of a complex shape, such as a hexagon with multiple right angles. Without designating a starting point, they become disoriented and count multiple sides more than once, resulting in a significantly incorrect perimeter."
1968,Mixes up width and height of a rectangle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the width and height of a rectangle, often leading to incorrect calculations of perimeter and area. Students may mistakenly label or substitute the width for the height or vice versa, resulting in miscalculations. This mix-up can be due to various reasons such as a lack of understanding of the definitions of width and height, not paying attention to the orientation of the rectangle, or not labeling the dimensions correctly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the perimeter of a rectangle, a student may use the width instead of the height or vice versa, leading to an incorrect calculation (e.g., P = 2(length + width) instead of P = 2(length + height)).
- When calculating the area of a rectangle, a student may multiply the width by itself instead of multiplying the width by the height (e.g., A = width * width instead of A = width * height).
- When comparing the dimensions of different rectangles, a student may incorrectly identify which rectangle has a greater width or height due to the mix-up.
- When solving real-world problems, such as finding the area of a room or the perimeter of a garden, students may make incorrect calculations due to confusing the width and height of the space."
1969,Mixes up square numbers and even numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that square numbers and even numbers are the same or have a direct correlation. They may assume that all square numbers are even or vice versa, simply because some square numbers are indeed even (e.g., 4, 16, 36). However, they fail to recognize that not all square numbers are even (e.g., 9, 25, 49) and that not all even numbers are square numbers (e.g., 2, 6, 10).

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When asked to identify square numbers, students might only list even numbers that are perfect squares, like 4 and 16, while excluding odd square numbers like 9 and 25.
- When given a set of numbers, students might incorrectly identify all even numbers as square numbers, including those that are not perfect squares, like 2 and 6.
- When solving problems that involve square numbers, students might mistakenly substitute even numbers that are not square numbers, leading to incorrect calculations and answers.
- When working with patterns, students might incorrectly assume that a sequence of even numbers is the same as a sequence of square numbers, leading to incorrect conclusions and generalizations."
1970,Confuses isosceles and right angle triangles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the characteristics of isosceles triangles and right-angled triangles. Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length, while right-angled triangles have one angle that measures 90 degrees. However, students with this misconception may believe that any triangle with two equal sides is automatically a right-angled triangle, or vice versa.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the type of triangle in a diagram, students may incorrectly label an isosceles triangle as a right-angled triangle simply because it has two equal sides, without checking if the triangle actually contains a 90-degree angle.
- When solving problems involving the properties of triangles, students may mistakenly apply the Pythagorean theorem to an isosceles triangle that is not necessarily right-angled.
- In construction tasks, students may attempt to create a right-angled triangle by simply drawing a triangle with two equal sides, without ensuring that the angle between them is 90 degrees."
1971,Confuses the inverse operations of addition and subtraction when rearranging equations,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to isolate a variable or solve for an unknown value in an equation. They may mistakenly swap the addition and subtraction operations instead of applying the correct inverse operations. For instance, when rearranging the equation x + 3 = 7, students might subtract 7 from both sides instead of subtracting 3, or when solving x - 2 = 9, they might add 2 to both sides but then incorrectly add 9 as well. This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of how inverse operations work and how to apply them correctly when solving equations.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

1. Solving the equation: 2x + 5 = 11, where the student might subtract 11 from both sides instead of subtracting 5.
2. Rearranging the equation: x - 4 = 8, where the student might add 8 to both sides instead of adding 4.
3. Isolating the variable in the equation: 3x + 2 = 14, where the student might subtract 14 from both sides instead of subtracting 2."
1972,Subtracts rather than multiplies when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the mathematical operation required in a word problem. They tend to subtract instead of multiplying, often due to a misunderstanding of the problem's context or a lack of understanding of the mathematical vocabulary used. This can be attributed to the student's inability to comprehend the problem's situation, leading them to apply the wrong operation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils. How many pencils does Tom have in total? (Student may subtract 4 from 3 or vice versa instead of multiplying 3 by 4)
- A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. How many books can the bookshelf hold in total? (Student may subtract 5 from 8 or vice versa instead of multiplying 5 by 8)
- A bakery sells 6 boxes of cookies, and each box contains 12 cookies. How many cookies did the bakery sell? (Student may subtract 6 from 12 or vice versa instead of multiplying 6 by 12)"
1973,Divides instead of multiplies when converting a decimal to a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a decimal to a percentage. They mistakenly think that to convert a decimal to a percentage, they need to divide the decimal by 100, instead of multiplying it by 100. This error is often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between decimals and percentages, or a simple calculation mistake.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting a decimal to a percentage in a real-world problem, such as calculating the interest rate on a savings account or the percentage of students who passed an exam.
- When comparing the performance of different groups, such as the percentage of boys versus girls who achieved a certain grade in a subject.
- When analyzing data, such as the percentage of people who voted for a particular candidate in an election.
- When solving problems involving discounts, markups, or other percentage changes, such as calculating the sale price of an item after a discount.
- When interpreting statistical data, such as the percentage of people who responded to a survey or the percentage of errors in a manufacturing process."
1974,Believes the gradient of a line is the root of its equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the gradient of a line and its equation. They may think that the gradient is the root or solution of the equation, rather than a measure of the line's steepness. For example, if the equation of a line is y = 2x + 3, students with this misconception may believe that the gradient is the value of x that makes the equation true (i.e., x = -3/2), rather than the coefficient of x (i.e., 2), which represents the rate of change of the line.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When finding the equation of a line given its gradient and a point it passes through.
- When graphing a linear equation and trying to identify the gradient from the graph.
- When solving problems involving the gradient of a line, such as finding the gradient of a line perpendicular to a given line.
- When comparing the steepness of different lines and trying to determine which one has a greater gradient."
1975,Does not understand the question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to comprehend the requirements or context of a mathematical question, leading to incorrect or incomplete solutions. It can stem from various factors, including unfamiliarity with mathematical terminology, lack of attention to detail, or difficulty in understanding the problem's context. As a result, students may misinterpret the question, leading to a misguided approach to solving the problem.

This misconception can manifest in various areas of mathematics, including:

- Number: When asked to find the ""difference"" between two numbers, students may interpret it as finding the sum or product instead of the actual difference.
- Algebra: In solving equations, students may misunderstand the question and attempt to solve for the wrong variable or fail to recognize the equation type (e.g., linear or quadratic).
- Data and Statistics: Students might misinterpret the type of data or the question being asked, leading to incorrect graphing or analysis of the data.
- Geometry: When asked to find the perimeter or area of a shape, students may misunderstand which calculation is required, leading to incorrect answers.
- Measure: Students may misinterpret the units of measurement, leading to incorrect conversions or calculations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to find the ""sum of the interior angles"" of a triangle but instead finds the perimeter.
- Case 2: A student is given a linear equation to solve for 'x' but attempts to solve for 'y' instead.
- Case 3: A student is asked to create a bar graph but creates a line graph instead, misinterpreting the type of data and question being asked.
- Case 4: A student is asked to find the area of a rectangle but finds the perimeter instead, misunderstanding the question's requirements.
- Case 5: A student is asked to convert 10 meters to centimeters but instead converts it to kilometers, misinterpreting the units of measurement."
1976,"When multiplying a fraction by an integer, multiplies both numerator and denominator by the integer","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying a fraction by an integer. They incorrectly assume that the multiplication process involves multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the integer, effectively ""distributing"" the multiplication to both parts of the fraction. This misconception is likely rooted in the student's prior understanding of multiplication as repeated addition or the distributive property in whole numbers.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying 1/2 by 3, where students might incorrectly calculate (1*3)/(2*3) = 3/6 instead of the correct 3/2.
- Multiplying 2/5 by 4, where students might incorrectly calculate (2*4)/(5*4) = 8/20 instead of the correct 8/5.
- Solving word problems, such as ""Tom has 1/4 of a cake and he wants to make 3 identical cakes. How much cake will he have in total?"", where students might incorrectly multiply both the numerator and denominator by 3."
1977,Confuses section and whole when using a bar model,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of using bar models to represent fractions or proportions. They tend to confuse a section of the bar model with the whole, leading to incorrect calculations or interpretations. This can happen when students are not clear about what the different parts of the bar model represent, or when they have difficulty visualizing the relationships between the parts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dividing a bar into equal parts to represent a fraction, a student might think that one part represents the whole instead of the total number of parts.
- When comparing two or more bar models, a student might mistakenly compare a section of one bar with the whole of another bar.
- When solving a problem that involves finding a proportion or fraction of a quantity, a student might incorrectly identify the section of the bar model as the whole quantity.
- When interpreting a bar model, a student might have difficulty distinguishing between the part and the whole, leading to incorrect conclusions or calculations."
1978,Subtracts instead of adds when answering worded problems ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the language used in worded problems, leading them to subtract instead of add. Students may struggle to comprehend the context and vocabulary used in the problem, such as words like ""altogether,"" ""total,"" or ""more,"" which indicate addition. They may mistakenly focus on words that imply subtraction, like ""take away"" or ""less,"" even if they are not present in the problem.

This misconception can also arise from a lack of understanding of the mathematical concept being asked, leading students to default to a familiar operation like subtraction. Additionally, students may not take the time to carefully read and analyze the problem, resulting in a quick but incorrect decision to subtract.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* ""Tom has 5 pencils in his pencil case. His friend gives him 3 more. How many pencils does Tom have now?"" (Student subtracts 3 from 5 instead of adding.)
* ""A bookshelf has 8 books on it. If 4 more books are added, how many books are on the bookshelf now?"" (Student subtracts 4 from 8 instead of adding.)
* ""Sarah has £5 to spend on sweets. She receives £2 more from her brother. How much money does Sarah have now?"" (Student subtracts £2 from £5 instead of adding.)"
1979,"Believes that they can reverse a percentage increase by decreasing the new value by the same percentage, and vice versa","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that percentage increases and decreases are symmetrical and can be ""reversed"" by simply applying the same percentage change in the opposite direction. They may think that if a value is increased by a certain percentage, decreasing the new value by the same percentage will return it to the original value, and vice versa. This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of the multiplicative nature of percentage changes.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A store increases the price of a shirt by 20%. A student may think that to return the price to its original value, the store can simply decrease the new price by 20%.
- Case 2: A person's salary is decreased by 15%. The student may believe that to restore the original salary, the employer can increase the new salary by 15%.
- Case 3: A recipe calls for a 25% increase in the amount of sugar. If the student wants to ""undo"" this increase, they may think that decreasing the new amount of sugar by 25% will return it to the original amount."
1980,"When multiplying fractions, adds the numerators and the denominators","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions. They may think that multiplying fractions involves adding the numerators (the numbers on top) and adding the denominators (the numbers on the bottom), rather than multiplying them. For example, when multiplying 1/2 and 1/3, students with this misconception may think the result is 2/5, because they add the numerators (1 + 1 = 2) and add the denominators (2 + 3 = 5).

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When multiplying simple fractions, e.g., 1/2 × 1/3
- When multiplying fractions with different denominators, e.g., 2/3 × 3/4
- When solving real-world problems that involve multiplying fractions, e.g., finding the area of a rectangle with fractional dimensions
- When simplifying expressions that involve multiplying fractions, e.g., simplifying (1/2 × 2/3) + 1/4"
1981,Does not know how to compare decimal numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the concept of decimal numbers and how to compare them. They may believe that the number with more digits after the decimal point is larger, or they may compare the digits incorrectly. For example, they might think that 0.5 is larger than 0.51 because 5 is larger than the first digit 5 in 0.51, without considering the subsequent digits.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Comparing decimal numbers with different numbers of digits after the decimal point (e.g., 0.5 vs. 0.512)
- Comparing decimal numbers with the same number of digits after the decimal point but with different values (e.g., 0.45 vs. 0.56)
- Comparing decimal numbers that are very close in value (e.g., 0.999 vs. 1.00)
- Comparing decimal numbers in real-world contexts, such as prices (e.g., $0.99 vs. $1.00) or measurements (e.g., 0.5 meters vs. 0.55 meters)"
1982,"When asked to find data points above a certain value, gives the number of data points below this value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of data analysis, particularly when dealing with inequalities or comparisons. They might interpret the question as asking for the opposite of what is actually required. In this case, when asked to find the number of data points above a certain value, the student incorrectly provides the number of data points below that value, essentially flipping the inequality.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

* Case 1: A student is given a set of exam scores and asked to find the number of students who scored above 80. Instead, they count and report the number of students who scored below 80.
* Case 2: In a dataset of temperatures, a student is asked to find the number of days when the temperature was above 25°C. However, they incorrectly report the number of days when the temperature was below 25°C.
* Case 3: A student is analyzing a dataset of heights and is asked to find the number of people who are taller than 170 cm. They mistakenly give the number of people who are shorter than 170 cm.

This misconception indicates a lack of understanding of inequalities and comparisons in data analysis, which can be addressed through targeted practice and explanation."
1983,"When dividing involving a multiple of 10, gives an answer 10 times smaller than it should be ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers by multiples of 10. They may incorrectly assume that when dividing by a multiple of 10, the result is 10 times smaller than the actual answer. This can be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of place value and the effect of dividing by multiples of 10 on the decimal point.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dividing 100 by 10, students may answer 0.1 instead of 10.
- When dividing 50 by 5 (a multiple of 10 being 10, but 5 is half of 10), students may answer 0.5 or 1, instead of 10.
- When dividing 400 by 40, students may answer 0.1 or 1 instead of 10.
- When solving word problems, such as ""If you have 100 pencils and you put them into boxes of 10 pencils each, how many boxes can you make?"", students may answer 0.1 or 1 box instead of 10 boxes."
1984,Adds when calculating volume instead of multiplying,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the volume of a 3D object, such as a rectangular prism or a cube. Instead of multiplying the length, width, and height to find the volume, they incorrectly add these dimensions together. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the concept of volume or a lack of understanding of the relationship between the dimensions of an object and its volume.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the volume of a rectangular box with a length of 5 units, a width of 3 units, and a height of 2 units, a student may incorrectly calculate the volume as 5 + 3 + 2 = 10 cubic units, instead of multiplying the dimensions together (5 x 3 x 2).
- When comparing the volumes of two different containers, a student may incorrectly add the dimensions of each container to determine which one has a greater volume.
- When solving real-world problems, such as finding the volume of a swimming pool or a container of water, a student may incorrectly apply the concept of addition instead of multiplication to calculate the volume."
1985,Has multiplied base by slant height and perpendicular height to find area of a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a triangle and mistakenly think that they need to multiply the base by both the slant height and the perpendicular height. This may be due to a lack of understanding of the formula for the area of a triangle, which is typically given as 0.5 * base * height, where 'height' refers specifically to the perpendicular height. Students may also be confusing this formula with that for the area of other shapes, such as the area of a parallelogram or the volume of a prism, where different dimensions are multiplied together.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Finding the area of a right-angled triangle, where students might think they need to multiply the base by both the slant height (the hypotenuse) and the perpendicular height.
- Calculating the area of an isosceles triangle, where students may confuse the slant height with the perpendicular height.
- Solving problems involving the area of triangles in real-world contexts, such as building design or landscape gardening, where students may misunderstand the dimensions given."
1986,"When writing ratio from diagram, writes total as one side","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to write a ratio from a diagram, but instead of comparing the parts to each other, they compare one part to the total. For example, if a diagram shows 3 red blocks and 5 blue blocks, the student might write the ratio as 3:8 (3 red blocks to a total of 8 blocks) instead of the correct ratio of 3:5 (3 red blocks to 5 blue blocks). This misconception demonstrates a misunderstanding of the concept of ratios, which is a comparison of two or more parts, not a part to the whole.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A diagram shows 5 boys and 7 girls in a class, and the student writes the ratio of boys to total students as 5:12.
- A picture shows 2 cats and 3 dogs, and the student writes the ratio of cats to total animals as 2:5.
- A chart displays 4 hours of work and 6 hours of leisure, and the student writes the ratio of work to total time as 4:10."
1987,"When completing the square in the form (x - a)^2 + b, believes b = the original constant","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They mistakenly believe that the value of 'b' in the completed square form (x - a)^2 + b is the same as the constant term in the original quadratic expression. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the process of completing the square, which involves creating a perfect square trinomial by adding and subtracting a specific value.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When completing the square for a quadratic expression in the form x^2 + bx + c, where the student might think that 'b' in the completed square form is the same as the constant term 'c'.
* When solving quadratic equations by completing the square, where the student might incorrectly write the equation in the completed square form and equate 'b' to the constant term.
* When working with quadratic expressions in the form (x - a)^2 + b, where the student might mistakenly identify 'b' as the original constant term, rather than the result of the completing the square process."
1988,Rounds up instead of down,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers to a specific place value or decimal place, but they consistently round up, even when the digit to be rounded is less than 5. This can be due to a misunderstanding of the rounding rules or a tendency to always ""round up"" as a default. As a result, the student will incorrectly increase the value of the number.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Rounding 4.2 to the nearest whole number (student answers 5 instead of 4)
- Rounding 12.48 to the nearest tenth (student answers 12.5 instead of 12.5 is correct but student will do the same even when it's 12.42)
- Rounding 6.9 kg to the nearest kilogram (student answers 7 kg, this is correct, but they will do the same when it's 6.2 kg)"
1989,Believes a coordinate cannot be placed beyond the bounds of the grid shown,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with coordinate grids and believe that the grid boundaries limit the placement of coordinates. They may think that coordinates cannot exist outside of the visible grid, and any point beyond the grid lines is not a valid coordinate. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of a coordinate plane as an infinite two-dimensional space, rather than being confined to the physical grid lines drawn on a piece of paper.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to plot coordinates with values greater than the grid size (e.g., (10, 15) on a 10x10 grid) and claim it's not possible.
- When students are given a problem that involves finding the midpoint or distance between two coordinates, one of which lies outside the grid boundaries, and they don't know how to handle it.
- When students are working with real-world applications of coordinates, such as mapping or navigation, and struggle to understand how coordinates can represent locations beyond the edge of a map or grid."
1990,Fails to reflect across mirror line,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to reflect a shape or a point across a mirror line (also known as a line of symmetry) in Geometry. The students may misunderstand the concept of reflection and fail to create an exact mirror image of the original shape on the opposite side of the mirror line. They may either not move the shape at all, move it to the wrong location, or flip it incorrectly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reflecting a triangle across a vertical mirror line, a student may only move the triangle horizontally without flipping it.
- When reflecting a shape across a diagonal mirror line, a student may rotate the shape instead of reflecting it.
- When reflecting a point across a horizontal mirror line, a student may move the point to the correct location but not change its orientation.
- When reflecting a complex shape, such as a polygon, across a mirror line, a student may struggle to accurately reflect each vertex, resulting in an incorrect reflection."
1991,Assumes any variable in a sum on the numerator can be divided by the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any variable present in a sum on the numerator of a fraction can be divided by the denominator. They might think that the division operation can be applied to individual terms within the numerator, rather than considering the numerator as a whole. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly simplify expressions and equations involving fractions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying expressions like (x + 3) / 3, students might incorrectly divide both x and 3 by 3, resulting in (x / 3) + 1, instead of treating the numerator as a single entity.
- When solving equations like (2x + 4) / 2 = 3, students might mistakenly divide 2x and 4 separately by 2, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with algebraic fractions, such as (x + 2) / (x + 1), students might incorrectly divide x and 2 by (x + 1), rather than considering the numerator and denominator as a whole."
1992,Believes extreme values can affect the mode,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that extreme values, also known as outliers, can affect the mode of a dataset. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. However, students with this misconception may think that if there is an extremely high or low value in the dataset, it will somehow influence the mode, making it higher or lower than it actually is.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a dataset of exam scores, a student scored 100 while the rest of the class scored between 50-70. A student with this misconception might think the mode will be skewed towards 100.
- Case 2: A dataset of daily temperatures in a city shows temperatures ranging from 15-25°C, but one day the temperature dropped to -5°C. A student might mistakenly believe the mode of the temperatures will be lower due to this extreme value.
- Case 3: A survey of the number of pets people have in a neighborhood shows most people have 1-2 pets, but one person has 20 pets. A student might incorrectly assume the mode will be higher due to this extreme value."
1993,Believes total in a grouped table is found by counting rows,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the total number of items or values in a grouped table can be found by simply counting the number of rows in the table. They may overlook the fact that each row can represent a group of values, not just a single value. This misconception demonstrates a lack of understanding of how grouped tables are structured and how data is organized within them.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Interpreting a frequency table where each row represents a range of values (e.g., 0-5, 6-10) and the student only counts the number of rows instead of considering the frequencies or values within each group.
- Analyzing a table with categorical data where each row represents a category (e.g., colors, shapes) and the student counts the categories instead of the total number of items within each category.
- Working with a table that displays aggregated data (e.g., number of students in each grade level) and the student mistakenly counts the number of grade levels instead of considering the total number of students across all grade levels."
1994,"When completing the square in the form (x - a)^2 + b, believes b = -a^2 regardless of the original constant","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They may mistakenly assume that the constant term 'b' in the completed square form (x - a)^2 + b is always the negative of the square of 'a', i.e., b = -a^2. This means that they think the constant term in the original quadratic expression does not affect the value of 'b' in the completed square form. As a result, they may ignore the original constant term and simply use the value of 'a' to determine 'b'.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When completing the square for the expression x^2 - 6x + 8, a student may write (x - 3)^2 - 9, ignoring the original constant term +8.
- When completing the square for the expression x^2 + 4x - 5, a student may write (x + 2)^2 - 4, disregarding the original constant term -5.
- When completing the square for the expression x^2 - 2x + 1, a student may write (x - 1)^2 - 1, instead of the correct (x - 1)^2."
1995,Mixes up shortest and longest when ordering times,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of time and ordering times from shortest to longest or vice versa. They may mistakenly identify a longer time period as being shorter, or a shorter time period as being longer. For example, students may think that 3 hours is shorter than 2 hours and 30 minutes, or that 1 hour and 45 minutes is longer than 2 hours.

This misconception can arise due to a lack of understanding of time units, conversion between units, or difficulty with comparing times. It can also be caused by a lack of practice in ordering times or a misunderstanding of the concept of time duration.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Comparing the duration of two events, such as a 50-minute class and a 1-hour class.
- Ordering times in a list from shortest to longest, such as 1 hour 30 minutes, 1 hour 15 minutes, and 2 hours.
- Solving word problems involving time, such as ""If a movie starts at 3:00 PM and lasts for 2 hours and 30 minutes, what time will it end?""
- Converting between different time units, such as converting 3 hours and 15 minutes to just hours or just minutes.
- Telling time on an analog clock and misunderstanding the hour and minute hands."
1996,Only includes fully shaded squares when counting area,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a shape, particularly those with partially shaded or fractional parts. They may incorrectly assume that only fully shaded squares should be counted, disregarding the partially shaded squares. As a result, they may underestimate the total area of the shape.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a rectangle with a fractional part, such as a rectangle with a length of 3.5 units and a width of 2 units.
- When calculating the area of a composite shape, such as a shape consisting of fully and partially shaded squares.
- When solving real-world problems involving area, such as finding the area of a room with a partially tiled floor.
- When working with mixed units, such as finding the area of a shape measured in both square meters and square centimeters.
- When estimating the area of an irregular shape, such as a shape with curved or angled boundaries."
1997,Believes vertically opposite angles sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the property of angles on a straight line to vertically opposite angles. They may think that because the two angles are opposite each other and appear to form a straight line, their sum must be 180 degrees. However, they fail to recognize that vertically opposite angles are actually equal in measure due to the symmetry of the intersecting lines.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the measure of a vertically opposite angle in a diagram and they mistakenly add the given angle to 180 degrees to find the other angle.
- When students are solving problems involving intersecting lines and they incorrectly apply the angle sum property of a straight line to the vertically opposite angles.
- When students are asked to identify the relationship between two angles in a diagram and they mistakenly state that the vertically opposite angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees) instead of equal."
1998,"When finding which term represents the median, thinks you divide the total number of terms by 2","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the median of a dataset with an odd or even number of values. They mistakenly believe that to find the median, you simply divide the total number of terms by 2, without considering whether the result is a whole number or not. They may not realize that when the total number of terms is odd, the median is actually the middle value, and when the total number of terms is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the median of a dataset with an odd number of values, e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (5 values).
- When finding the median of a dataset with an even number of values, e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (6 values).
- When dealing with a large dataset and relying solely on the ""divide by 2"" rule without considering the actual values and their position in the dataset."
1999,Does not interpret the correct order of operations from a worded problem,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to translate worded problems into mathematical expressions, leading to incorrect application of the order of operations. The order of operations (often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS or PEMDAS) dictates that calculations should be performed in a specific order: Brackets (or Parentheses), Indices (or Exponents), Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. 

Students with this misconception may incorrectly perform operations in the order they appear in the worded problem, rather than following the correct order. For example, they might perform addition before multiplication, or ignore brackets and indices altogether.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 friends coming over, and 2 of his cousins will also join. How many people will be at Tom's house?"" (Student may add 3 and 4 before multiplying 3 by 4, or add 2 before performing the multiplication.)
- ""A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 3 rows of 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many books can be placed on it?"" (Student may multiply 5 by 3 before multiplying 3 by 8, or add the results of the multiplications incorrectly.)
- ""A bakery is making a special batch of cookies for a holiday sale. They need to package 12 boxes of cookies, with each box containing 6 rows of 8 cookies. How many cookies will the bakery package in total?"" (Student may multiply 12 by 6 before multiplying 6 by 8, or add the results of the multiplications incorrectly.)"
2000,Believes multiplying by 0.1 is the same as multiplying by 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of decimal multiplication, particularly when dealing with multiplying by decimals less than 1. They may mistakenly believe that multiplying a number by 0.1 will result in the same effect as multiplying by 10, possibly due to the fact that both operations involve a ""shift"" in the decimal point, but in opposite directions. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the actual effect of multiplying by a decimal, which is equivalent to a fractional part of the whole.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When converting between units, such as converting 10 grams to kilograms (student might think multiplying by 0.1 will give the correct answer, instead of dividing by 1000 or multiplying by 0.001).
* When performing calculations involving money, such as calculating 0.1 times the cost of an item (student might expect the result to be 10 times the original cost).
* When solving problems involving proportions or percentages, such as finding 10% of a number (student might mistakenly multiply by 0.1, then incorrectly assume it's the same as multiplying by 10).
* When working with measurement conversions, such as converting 10 meters to centimeters (student might think multiplying by 0.1 will give the correct answer, instead of multiplying by 100)."
2001,"When solving an equation,  subtracts instead of multiplying","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of inverse operations in algebra. They may believe that to isolate a variable, they need to perform the opposite operation, but instead of multiplying by the reciprocal of the coefficient, they subtract the coefficient. For example, in the equation 2x = 6, students with this misconception might subtract 2 from both sides, resulting in 2x - 2 = 6 - 2, instead of multiplying both sides by 1/2 or dividing by 2.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Solving linear equations: 3x = 9, where students might subtract 3 from both sides instead of multiplying by 1/3.
- Solving equations with fractions: 1/4x = 3, where students might subtract 1/4 from both sides instead of multiplying by 4.
- Solving equations with decimals: 0.5x = 2, where students might subtract 0.5 from both sides instead of multiplying by 2."
2002,"When dividing a decimal by an integer, divides by the wrong power of 10 when reinserting the decimal.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing decimals by integers and need to reinsert the decimal point in the quotient. They may incorrectly determine the power of 10 to divide by, often due to a lack of understanding of place value or the division process itself. This can lead to incorrect placement of the decimal point, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Dividing 12.5 by 5: A student may incorrectly reinsert the decimal point, thinking that 125 divided by 5 is 25, and then incorrectly place the decimal point, getting 2.5 or 25 instead of the correct answer 2.5.
- Dividing 4.8 by 2: A student may divide 48 by 2 and get 24, then reinsert the decimal point in the wrong place, resulting in 2.4 or 24 instead of the correct answer 2.4.
- Dividing 9.6 by 4: A student may divide 96 by 4 and get 24, then reinsert the decimal point incorrectly, resulting in 2.4 or 24 instead of the correct answer 2.4."
2003,Believes multiply all numbers in a prime factor venn diagram gives the value of one sets number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of prime factorization and Venn diagrams. They incorrectly assume that by multiplying all the numbers in a prime factor Venn diagram, they will obtain the original number of one of the sets. In reality, the numbers in a prime factor Venn diagram represent the common and unique prime factors of the given numbers.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the least common multiple (LCM) or highest common factor (HCF) of two or more numbers, students might multiply all the numbers in the Venn diagram, expecting to get the LCM or HCF.
- When comparing the prime factorization of two or more numbers, students may multiply the numbers in the Venn diagram to determine the relationship between the numbers.
- When solving problems involving sets and intersections, students may incorrectly apply this misconception, leading to incorrect solutions."
2004,Confuses frequency polygons with cumulative frequency diagrams,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between two types of graphical representations: frequency polygons and cumulative frequency diagrams. They may incorrectly interpret or construct these graphs due to a lack of understanding of their distinct purposes and characteristics.

Frequency polygons are graphical representations used to display the distribution of data. They are constructed by joining the midpoints of the top of each bar in a histogram with straight lines. Students may mistakenly believe that these lines represent cumulative totals.

On the other hand, cumulative frequency diagrams are graphical representations that show the cumulative total of frequencies as the data values increase. These diagrams are often used to find the median, quartiles, and other positional statistics.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- When students are given a set of data and asked to construct a frequency polygon, but they end up constructing a cumulative frequency diagram instead.
- When interpreting a frequency polygon, students may incorrectly conclude that the graph represents the cumulative total of frequencies rather than the distribution of individual frequencies.
- When comparing two data sets, students may mistakenly compare a frequency polygon from one set with a cumulative frequency diagram from another set.
- When asked to identify specific statistics such as the median or interquartile range, students may incorrectly use a frequency polygon instead of a cumulative frequency diagram."
2005,Multiplies all given dimensions when calculating the length of the hypotenuse in a right angled triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Instead of squaring the lengths of the two sides and then finding the square root of the sum, some students may mistakenly multiply the given dimensions, thinking that this will give them the length of the hypotenuse.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When finding the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle with legs of 3cm and 4cm, a student may multiply 3 and 4 to get 12cm, instead of using the Pythagorean theorem to find the correct length of 5cm (since √(3² + 4²) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5).
* When solving a problem involving a right-angled triangle with legs of 5m and 12m, a student may multiply 5 and 12 to get 60m, instead of using the Pythagorean theorem to find the correct length of the hypotenuse (since √(5² + 12²) = √(25 + 144) = √169 = 13m).
* When working with real-world problems, such as finding the length of a ladder needed to reach a certain height, a student may mistakenly multiply the horizontal and vertical distances, instead of using the Pythagorean theorem to find the correct length of the ladder."
2006,Believes the mean is total divided by sum of categories given,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean. They believe that to find the mean, you need to divide the total by the number of categories or groups, rather than the total number of values or data points. For example, if a survey asks people about their favorite colors and provides 5 categories (red, blue, green, yellow, and other), students with this misconception might think that to find the mean number of people who chose each color, they should divide the total number of people surveyed by 5 (the number of categories).

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Case 1: A student is asked to find the average number of pets per household in a neighborhood, and the data is categorized by type of pet (dogs, cats, birds, etc.). They might divide the total number of pets by the number of pet categories instead of the total number of households.
- Case 2: A student is analyzing the scores of a test, and the scores are grouped into categories (e.g., 0-20, 21-40, 41-60, etc.). They might think that to find the mean score, they should divide the total score by the number of score categories instead of the total number of students.
- Case 3: A student is calculating the average daily rainfall in a month, and the data is categorized by days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, etc.). They might divide the total rainfall by 7 (the number of days of the week) instead of the total number of days in the month."
2007,Believes the number of vertices on a 3D shape match those of the 2D cross section,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between the properties of a 3D shape and its 2D cross-section. They mistakenly believe that the number of vertices (corners) on a 3D shape is the same as the number of vertices on a 2D cross-section of that shape. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect assumptions about the properties of 3D shapes and their relationships to 2D representations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When students are asked to identify the number of vertices on a 3D cube and its 2D cross-section (a square). They may incorrectly assume that both have 4 vertices, when in fact the cube has 8 vertices.
2. When students are tasked with drawing a 2D net of a 3D shape, such as a pyramid, and assume that the number of vertices on the net is the same as the number of vertices on the 3D shape.
3. When students are solving problems involving 3D shapes and are asked to find the number of vertices based on a given 2D cross-section.
4. When students are working with different types of prisms (e.g., triangular prism, rectangular prism) and mistakenly assume that the number of vertices on the 2D cross-section is the same as the number of vertices on the 3D prism."
2008,"When substiting into an algebraic term, raises the coefficient to the power of the variable rather than multiplying the coefficient and the variable..","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with algebraic expressions involving exponents and coefficients. They tend to incorrectly apply the exponent to the coefficient instead of just multiplying the coefficient with the variable raised to that exponent. 

For instance, given an expression like 2x^3, students with this misconception may think that when substituting x = 2, the expression becomes (2*2)^3 = 4^3 = 64, rather than the correct calculation of 2 * (2)^3 = 2 * 8 = 16.

Cases where this misconception may occur include:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions with exponents and coefficients, such as 3x^2, 4y^3, etc.
- When substituting values into algebraic equations or formulas, such as solving for x in the equation 2x^2 + 3x - 1 = 0.
- When working with geometric sequences or series that involve terms with exponents, such as 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.
- When solving problems involving exponential growth or decay, such as population growth or chemical reactions."
2009,"Assumes they add all values in a worded problem, thereby not interpreting the problem correctly","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand the context of a word problem and instead, simply add all the numbers given, regardless of the mathematical operations required. They might ignore keywords or phrases that indicate different operations such as subtraction, multiplication, or division. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the problem's context or an inability to translate the words into mathematical symbols.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* A problem states, ""Tom has 5 boxes of pens, and each box contains 8 pens. If he gives 2 boxes to his friend, how many pens does Tom have left?"" A student with this misconception might simply add 5, 8, and 2, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* A problem asks, ""A bookshelf has 12 shelves, and 5 books are removed from it. If 8 more books are added, how many books are on the bookshelf now?"" A student with this misconception might add 12, 5, and 8, instead of first subtracting 5 and then adding 8.
* A problem states, ""A bakery sells 15 cakes and 20 pastries in a day. If they make a profit of $5 on each cake and $3 on each pastry, what is their total profit?"" A student with this misconception might simply add 15, 20, 5, and 3, instead of multiplying the number of cakes and pastries by their respective profits and then adding the results."
2010,Does not understand power notation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to comprehend the concept of power notation, also known as exponentiation. Power notation is a shorthand way of writing repeated multiplication of the same number. For example, 2^3 means 2 multiplied by itself 3 times (2 × 2 × 2). Students with this misconception may interpret the exponent as simply an additional operation to be performed, rather than as an instruction to repeat the multiplication.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When simplifying expressions, students may incorrectly add or multiply the exponent instead of applying the power rule. For instance, they might think that 2^3 + 2^2 is equal to 2^(3+2) or 2^5.
* When solving equations, students may not recognize that the exponent applies to the entire base, leading to incorrect calculations. For example, they might think that (2+3)^2 is equal to 2^2 + 3^2.
* When comparing numbers, students may not understand that a larger exponent means a larger value, even if the base is the same. For instance, they might think that 2^2 is greater than 2^3.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

* Simplifying expressions: 3^2 × 3^4 = ?
* Solving equations: 2^x = 8, what is x?
* Comparing numbers: Which is larger, 4^2 or 4^3?"
2011,"When simplifying surds, leaves the square root of the biggest square number under the root and puts the other number on the outside","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. Students with this misconception may believe that to simplify a surd, they need to find the largest perfect square that is less than the number under the square root sign and leave its square root under the sign, while putting the remaining number outside the square root. 

For example, when simplifying √24, a student with this misconception may think that since the largest perfect square less than 24 is 16 (4^2), they should leave √16 under the root and put the remaining 8 outside, resulting in 8√4 or 4√4. Similarly, when simplifying √50, they might leave √49 under the root and put 1 outside, resulting in 1√7, since 49 is the largest perfect square less than 50.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Simplifying √18, where the student leaves √16 under the root and puts 2 outside.
- Simplifying √48, where the student leaves √36 under the root and puts 12 outside, or leaves √49 and puts -1 outside.
- Simplifying √75, where the student leaves √64 under the root and puts 11 outside."
2012,When reading a dash on a number line does not take into account the number at the start or the width of each division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify or place a number on a number line that has marked intervals or dashes, but they fail to consider the starting point of the number line or the scale of the intervals. They may simply count the dashes without taking into account the number at the start of the line or the width of each division. For example, if a number line starts at 5 and has intervals of 2, a student with this misconception may count the dashes as 1, 2, 3, etc., without realizing that the first dash actually represents 7 (5 + 2), the second dash represents 9 (5 + 2 + 2), and so on.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a number line starts at a number other than 0, such as 5 or 10, and students are asked to identify a number on the line.
- When the intervals on the number line are not equal to 1, such as intervals of 2, 5, or 10, and students are asked to place a number on the line.
- When students are asked to estimate the value of a number on a number line with irregular intervals or no clear starting point.
- When students are comparing numbers on two different number lines with different scales or starting points."
2013,"When drawing a histogram, thinks you plot cumulative frequency on the horizontal axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the components of a histogram. They may think that the horizontal axis represents the cumulative frequency, which is the total frequency of all data points up to a certain value. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly plot the cumulative frequency on the horizontal axis, rather than the class intervals or bins, which represent the range of values.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to create a histogram from a set of data and they mistakenly label the horizontal axis as ""cumulative frequency"" instead of the correct label, which is usually the variable being measured (e.g. ""height"", ""weight"", etc.).
- When students are given a table of data with cumulative frequencies and they incorrectly assume that these values should be plotted on the horizontal axis, rather than using the class intervals or bins.
- When students are comparing histograms and mistakenly think that the horizontal axis represents the cumulative frequency, leading to incorrect interpretations of the data."
2014,Believes if a point is reflected in the line x=a then the x coordinate of the point will become 'a',"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reflection in geometry. They believe that when a point is reflected in the line x=a, the x-coordinate of the reflected point will always become 'a', regardless of the original x-coordinate. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of reflection as a transformation that flips a point over a line, rather than simply changing its x-coordinate to a fixed value.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* A point (3, 4) is reflected in the line x=2. The student may think the reflected point is (2, 4) instead of the correct answer.
* A point (-1, 2) is reflected in the line x=0. The student may think the reflected point is (0, 2) instead of the correct answer.
* A point (5, 1) is reflected in the line x=3. The student may think the reflected point is (3, 1) instead of the correct answer."
2015,Forgot to square both parts of the fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with fractions and need to square the entire fraction, but they forget to square both the numerator and the denominator. Squaring a fraction involves squaring each part of the fraction separately, not just squaring the numerator or the denominator. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and fractions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the area of a rectangle with fractional side lengths, a student may forget to square both parts of the fraction, leading to an incorrect calculation.
- In algebra, when simplifying an expression that involves squaring a fraction, a student may only square the numerator, resulting in an incorrect solution.
- When working with equivalent ratios in geometry, a student may forget to square both parts of a fractional ratio, leading to an incorrect proportion.
- In data analysis, when calculating the variance or standard deviation of a set of data with fractional values, a student may forget to square both parts of the fraction, resulting in an incorrect statistical calculation."
2016,Believes the nth term of a descending sequence will have a positive coefficient of n,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with the general form of an arithmetic sequence's nth term formula (e.g., an = a1 + (n-1)d), where 'd' is the common difference and 'a1' is the first term. They tend to generalize this pattern to all sequences. In the case of descending sequences, students may assume that the coefficient of 'n' in the nth term formula will be positive, as it is in ascending sequences. They fail to recognize that a descending sequence will have a negative common difference or a decreasing pattern, which would result in a negative coefficient of 'n'.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Finding the nth term of a sequence like 10, 8, 6, 4, ...
2. Writing a formula for the sequence 25, 20, 15, 10, ...
3. Determining the nth term of the sequence 50, 45, 40, 35, ..."
2017,Mixes up square rooting and multiplying by 2 or doubling,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that finding the square root of a number is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 or simply doubling it. They may think that the square root operation is a simple multiplication operation, rather than a distinct mathematical process that finds a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying expressions, like √16, students might think the answer is 32 (16 x 2) instead of 4 (the actual square root of 16).
- When solving equations, like √x = 5, students might think x is equal to 10 (5 x 2) instead of 25 (the actual square of 5).
- When working with geometric shapes, like finding the side length of a square with an area of 49, students might think the side length is 98 (49 x 2) instead of 7 (the actual square root of 49).
- When dealing with real-world problems, like calculating the length of a diagonal in a room, students might apply this misconception and arrive at incorrect solutions."
2018,Thinks a divide and a negative sign next to each other makes a minus,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly interpret the division symbol (÷) and a negative sign (-) together as a subtraction or minus sign. They may think that the division operation is changed to subtraction because of the presence of the negative sign. For example, they might think that -12 ÷ 3 or 12 ÷ -3 is the same as 12 - 3. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the order of operations and how to handle negative numbers in division.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- -8 ÷ 2 (students might think it's 8 - 2 instead of dividing 8 by 2 and then applying the negative sign)
- 9 ÷ -3 (students might think it's 9 - 3 instead of dividing 9 by 3 and then applying the negative sign)
- -15 ÷ 5 (students might think it's 15 - 5 instead of dividing 15 by 5 and then applying the negative sign)"
2019,"When there's a negative sign in the question, thinks the answer must be negative","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the presence of a negative sign in a mathematical expression or equation automatically means that the answer or result will also be negative. They may overlook the actual mathematical operations involved, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, and the rules governing the handling of negative numbers. As a result, they tend to incorrectly assume that any negative sign in the question will inevitably lead to a negative answer, regardless of the other numbers or operations involved.

This misconception can occur in various situations, including:

* When subtracting a negative number, e.g., 5 - (-3)
* When multiplying or dividing two negative numbers, e.g., (-4) × (-6) or (-8) ÷ (-2)
* When adding a negative number to a larger positive number, e.g., 8 + (-2)
* When solving linear equations with negative coefficients or constants, e.g., 2x - 5 = 3 or x - 2 = -7"
2020,"When simplifying surds, does not use the largest square number to simplify","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying surds, which are square roots of numbers that cannot be expressed as perfect squares. Students with this misconception may not recognize the importance of using the largest square number to simplify the surd, leading them to simplify it incompletely or incorrectly. They may instead use smaller square numbers, which will not fully simplify the surd.

For example, when simplifying √48, students with this misconception might recognize that 4 is a square number and simplify it as √(4*12) = 2√12. However, they fail to recognize that 48 can be further broken down using the larger square number 16, resulting in an incomplete simplification.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Simplifying √72 as √(4*18) = 2√18 instead of √(36*2) = 6√2
- Simplifying √50 as √(4*12.5) = 2√12.5 instead of √(25*2) = 5√2
- Simplifying √108 as √(4*27) = 2√27 instead of √(36*3) = 6√3"
2021,Does not recognise when a fraction can be simplified,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that fractions can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). They may believe that the original form of the fraction is the only or most accurate way to represent the value, and do not recognize that equivalent fractions can be obtained by simplifying. As a result, they may work with and present fractions in their most complex, rather than simplest, form.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When adding or subtracting fractions with common factors, students may not simplify the result.
- When comparing fractions, students may not recognize that two fractions are equivalent if they can be simplified to the same form.
- When solving problems involving fractions, such as dividing a pizza or a cake, students may provide answers in unsimplified fractions.
- When converting between improper fractions and mixed numbers, students may not simplify the fraction before converting.
- When working with equivalent ratios, students may not recognize that simplifying fractions is essential to identifying equivalent ratios."
2022,"
Has incorrect belief about the meaning of ""expression""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that an expression in mathematics must always have an equals sign (=) or that it must be a complete equation. They may think that an expression is the same as an equation, and that it must be solved to find a specific value. In reality, an expression is a collection of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations combined, but not necessarily equal to something. For example, 2x + 3 is an expression, but it does not have to be equal to a specific value.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to algebra and are asked to identify or simplify expressions.
- When students are working with formulas, such as the area of a rectangle (length x width), and think that the formula itself is an equation that needs to be solved.
- When students are given word problems that involve expressions, such as ""Tom has 5 more books than his friend"" and think that they need to find a specific value for the number of books Tom's friend has.
- When students are working with function machines or input-output tables and think that the expression that represents the function must always have an equals sign.
- When students are asked to generate or match equivalent expressions and think that the expressions must be equal to the same value."
2023,Thinks when finding a percentage you divide by the percentage being asked,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding a percentage of a number. They mistakenly believe that to find a percentage, they need to divide the number by the percentage being asked, rather than understanding that finding a percentage involves multiplying the number by the percentage as a decimal. For example, if asked to find 25% of 120, students with this misconception may divide 120 by 25, rather than multiplying 120 by 0.25.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When calculating discounts or sales tax on a purchase, students may divide the original price by the discount percentage instead of multiplying it by the discount as a decimal.
- When finding the percentage of a quantity, such as the percentage of students who scored above a certain grade, students may divide the number of students by the percentage instead of multiplying the number of students by the percentage as a decimal.
- When solving problems involving interest rates or investment returns, students may divide the principal amount by the interest rate instead of multiplying it by the interest rate as a decimal."
2024,Confuses the variable and frequency columns in a frequency table,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly swap the roles of the variable and frequency columns in a frequency table. In a frequency table, the variable column represents the different values or categories of data being recorded, while the frequency column represents the number of times each value or category occurs. 

When students confuse these columns, they may incorrectly assume that the variable column shows the number of occurrences and the frequency column shows the actual values or categories. This can lead to misinterpretation of the data and incorrect conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is given a frequency table showing the number of pets owned by students in a class. The table has two columns: ""Number of Pets"" and ""Frequency"". The student incorrectly assumes that the ""Number of Pets"" column shows how many students have a certain number of pets, and the ""Frequency"" column shows the actual number of pets.

2. In a survey about favorite colors, a frequency table is created with columns ""Color"" and ""Frequency"". A student mistakenly thinks that the ""Color"" column represents the number of people who chose each color, and the ""Frequency"" column represents the different colors themselves.

3. A student is analyzing a frequency table about the number of books read by students in a month. The table has columns ""Number of Books"" and ""Frequency"". The student incorrectly believes that the ""Number of Books"" column shows the frequency of reading, and the ""Frequency"" column shows the actual number of books read."
2025,Does not realise a triangular prism is a 3D shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that a triangular prism extends beyond a two-dimensional (2D) shape, having length, width, and height. They might perceive it as a flat, 2D triangle rather than a three-dimensional (3D) object with a specific thickness or depth. This could be due to difficulties in visualizing or understanding the concept of 3D shapes, or lack of hands-on experience with real-life triangular prisms.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. When students are shown a 2D drawing or diagram of a triangular prism and assume it's just a flat triangle.
2. When students are given a net of a triangular prism to assemble and fail to visualize the final 3D shape.
3. When students are asked to describe the properties of a triangular prism and only mention its 2D characteristics, such as the number of sides or angles.
4. When students have difficulty calculating the volume of a triangular prism, as they don't understand its 3D nature.
5. When students are shown real-life examples of triangular prisms, such as a roof or a building, but still struggle to see them as 3D shapes rather than just flat surfaces."
2026,Reflects instead of rotates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that a rotation is the same as a reflection. In geometry, a reflection involves flipping a shape over a line, resulting in a mirror image on the other side. On the other hand, a rotation involves turning a shape around a fixed point, known as the center of rotation, by a certain angle. Students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that rotating a shape will result in a mirrored image, rather than the actual result of the shape being turned.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to rotate a shape by 90 degrees, a student may draw the shape reflected over the x or y-axis instead of actually rotating it.
- When solving problems involving rotational symmetry, students may incorrectly identify the line of symmetry as the axis of rotation.
- When working with real-world applications, such as designing circular patterns or models, students may mistakenly create reflections instead of rotations, resulting in incorrect designs.
- When solving problems involving coordinates, students may incorrectly apply reflection transformations instead of rotation transformations to find the new coordinates of a point after rotation."
2027,Believes that an + b is still a multiple of a,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiples. They may think that adding any number (b) to a multiple of a (an) will still result in a multiple of a. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of addition and the definition of multiples. Students may assume that the addition of any number to a multiple will always preserve the multiplicative relationship.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify multiples of a number in a sequence or pattern, students may include numbers that are not actual multiples.
- When solving problems involving addition and multiples, students may incorrectly assume that the result of adding two numbers is always a multiple of one of the original numbers.
- When working with number sequences or patterns, students may mistakenly think that adding a constant to each term will always result in a sequence of multiples."
2028,"When writing a number between zero and one in standard form, thinks the power is the negative of the number of decimal places","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to write numbers between 0 and 1 in standard form. They mistakenly believe that the power of 10 is simply the negative of the number of decimal places the number has, rather than considering the actual place value of the digits. 

For example, when writing 0.0045 in standard form, students with this misconception may incorrectly write it as 4.5 x 10^-3, simply because 0.0045 has 3 decimal places, without realizing that the correct standard form is actually 4.5 x 10^-3, which is correct in this case, but the reasoning behind it is incorrect.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

* Writing 0.0008 in standard form, incorrectly thinking it's 8 x 10^-4 because it has 4 decimal places.
* Writing 0.02 in standard form, incorrectly thinking it's 2 x 10^-2 because it has 2 decimal places.
* Writing 0.000035 in standard form, incorrectly thinking it's 3.5 x 10^-5 because it has 5 decimal places."
2029,Believes non-unit multiples of vectors can be the same length,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that multiplying a vector by a scalar only changes its direction, but not its magnitude, or that the magnitude change is not proportional to the scalar. They may think that two vectors with different magnitudes can be multiples of each other, as long as they have the same direction. This misunderstanding leads students to incorrectly assume that non-unit multiples of vectors can have the same length.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing two vectors with the same direction but different magnitudes, students may incorrectly identify one as a multiple of the other.
- When solving problems involving vector addition or subtraction, students may incorrectly assume that the resulting vector has the same magnitude as one of the original vectors.
- When graphing vectors, students may draw vectors with different lengths but the same direction and incorrectly label them as multiples of each other.
- When solving problems involving scalar multiplication, students may incorrectly assume that the magnitude of the resulting vector is not proportional to the scalar."
2030,Believes that fractions with larger denominators are greater in size,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students compare fractions and incorrectly assume that the fraction with the larger denominator is greater in size. They may think that as the denominator increases, the fraction's value also increases. This misconception likely stems from a lack of understanding of the relationship between the numerator and the denominator in a fraction. The students may focus solely on the denominator, neglecting the role of the numerator in determining the fraction's value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing 1/8 and 1/10: A student may think that 1/10 is greater than 1/8 because 10 is larger than 8.
- Comparing 2/4 and 3/6: A student may believe that 3/6 is greater than 2/4 because 6 is larger than 4.
- Comparing 3/12 and 2/8: A student may think that 3/12 is greater than 2/8 because 12 is larger than 8."
2031,Misremembers the exact values of trigonometric functions at standard angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly recall or misremember the values of trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, and tangent) at common angles such as 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°. These angles have well-known trigonometric values that are frequently used in geometry and trigonometry problems. However, students may confuse or swap the values of these functions, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving right-angled triangle problems and needing to apply trigonometric ratios to find unknown sides or angles.
- In problems involving the unit circle and the coordinates of points on the circle, which rely heavily on the exact values of trigonometric functions at standard angles.
- When simplifying trigonometric expressions or identities that involve standard angles, and incorrect values lead to algebraic errors.
- In physics and engineering applications where trigonometry is used to describe motion, forces, or wave patterns, and precise values are crucial for accurate modeling and prediction.
- When working with periodic functions, such as modeling sound waves or light waves, where standard angles and their trigonometric values play a key role."
2032,Believes the gradient of a distance-time graph is the acceleration,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly interpret the gradient of a distance-time graph as a measure of acceleration. They may believe that a steeper gradient indicates greater acceleration, rather than realizing that the gradient of a distance-time graph actually represents the speed of an object. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the motion of an object, particularly when analyzing graphs that show changes in distance over time.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When analyzing a distance-time graph with a steep slope, a student might say, ""The acceleration is really high at this point,"" instead of recognizing that the steep slope indicates a high speed.
- When comparing two distance-time graphs, a student might claim that the graph with the steeper slope has greater acceleration, rather than considering the actual changes in speed.
- When asked to describe the motion of an object based on its distance-time graph, a student might incorrectly identify periods of acceleration or deceleration based on the gradient of the graph."
2033,Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (1 decimal place rather than nearest whole number),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers, but they incorrectly apply the rules of rounding. They might round a number to one decimal place instead of rounding it to the nearest whole number. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of rounding or not fully grasping the context of the problem, which requires rounding to the nearest whole number.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Rounding 4.7 to 4.7 instead of 5 (nearest whole number).
2. Rounding 2.9 to 2.9 instead of 3 (nearest whole number).
3. In a measurement problem, a student measures the length of an object as 15.8 cm and rounds it to 15.8 cm instead of 16 cm (nearest whole number).
4. In a calculation, a student gets the answer 12.4 and rounds it to 12.4 instead of 12 (nearest whole number)."
2034,Finds an equivalent improper fraction when asked for a mixed number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to convert an improper fraction to a mixed number but instead provide another equivalent improper fraction. This shows that they understand the concept of equivalent fractions but have difficulty with the procedural step of dividing the numerator by the denominator to find the whole number part and the remainder for the mixed number. They might be over-relying on their understanding of equivalent ratios rather than understanding the distinct format and purpose of mixed numbers.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting an improper fraction like 5/3, the student might answer with another improper fraction like 10/6 instead of the mixed number 1 2/3.
- When simplifying fractions in word problems, such as sharing or measurement, the student might provide an equivalent improper fraction instead of converting it to a mixed number as requested.
- In problems that involve comparing or ordering fractions, the student might provide equivalent improper fractions instead of mixed numbers, showing they can find equivalent fractions but miss the procedural step or the purpose of using mixed numbers."
2035,"When reading integers on a number line, assumes each dash is 10","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to number lines and assume that each dash or mark represents a jump of 10 units. They may incorrectly believe that the dashes are evenly spaced by tens, rather than understanding that the spacing between dashes can represent different intervals (e.g., 1, 5, or 10 units). As a result, they may misinterpret the scale of the number line and incorrectly identify or plot integers.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A student is asked to identify the integer at the 5th dash from 0 on a number line, and they respond with 50, assuming each dash represents 10 units.
* When plotting the integer -20 on a number line, a student places it 2 dashes to the left of 0, assuming each dash is 10 units.
* A student is given a number line with dashes at 0, 5, 10, and 15, and they incorrectly label the dashes as 0, 10, 20, and 30."
2036,Identified the interior not exterior angle at a point,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify the interior angle at a point on a shape, rather than the exterior angle. The interior angle is the angle formed by two sides of the shape meeting at a point, whereas the exterior angle is the angle formed by one side of the shape and the extension of an adjacent side. Students may incorrectly label or measure the interior angle when they are asked to find the exterior angle at a point on a shape.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When finding the exterior angle of a polygon, students might incorrectly measure the interior angle at a vertex.
2. When calculating the exterior angle sum of a polygon, students may mistakenly add the interior angles at each vertex.
3. When working with angles in a triangle, students may incorrectly identify the exterior angle at a vertex as the interior angle.
4. When solving problems involving angles in a circle, students may mistakenly measure the interior angle subtended by an arc instead of the exterior angle.
5. When constructing shapes with specific exterior angles, students may incorrectly draw the shape with the given interior angle instead of the exterior angle."
2037,Believes switching the gradient and y-intercept gives a parallel line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that switching the values of the gradient (slope) and y-intercept in the equation of a line will result in a new line that is parallel to the original line. They may think that simply swapping these values will preserve the relationship between the lines, leading to parallel lines. However, this incorrect assumption can cause students to generate lines with different slopes, which in fact means the lines will intersect rather than being parallel.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When finding the equation of a parallel line, students might switch the slope and y-intercept of the original line, thinking the resulting line will be parallel.
- Case 2: In a graphing exercise, students may be asked to draw a line parallel to a given line, and they may incorrectly assume that switching the slope and y-intercept will give them the desired parallel line.
- Case 3: When solving problems involving multiple lines, students might apply the misconception to determine if two lines are parallel, incorrectly concluding that lines with switched slope and y-intercept values are parallel."
2038,Believes a common denominator can only be the lowest common multiple,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of adding and subtracting fractions, and they learn that to do so, the fractions must have the same denominator. In the process of finding this common denominator, students are often taught to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of the two denominators. However, some students may misinterpret this to mean that the LCM is the only possible common denominator, rather than understanding that any common multiple can be used.

This misconception can lead students to believe that they must always find the LCM, even in cases where it is not necessary or is overly complicated. They may struggle with problems where finding the LCM is not straightforward or where using a different common denominator would be more efficient.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, a student may insist on finding the LCM, even if a simpler common denominator is available.
- When working with equivalent ratios or proportions, a student may believe that they must always use the LCM to compare the ratios, rather than recognizing that other common denominators can be used.
- In problems involving the comparison of fractions, a student may incorrectly assume that the only way to compare them is by converting both fractions to have the LCM as the denominator."
2039,Thinks you need to just add a % sign to a number to make it a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that converting a number to a percentage simply involves adding a percentage sign (%) to the end of it, without understanding the actual process of converting the number to a percentage. They fail to recognize that a percentage represents a proportion or fraction of 100, and that the number needs to be converted to a fraction of 100 or divided by 100 before it can be considered a percentage.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing quantities: For example, a student might think that 20 is equivalent to 20% of a total quantity, without realizing that 20% actually means 20 out of 100, not just the number 20.
- When calculating discounts or increases: A student might believe that a 20% discount on a price of $100 is simply $20, without understanding that the discount is actually 20% of the original price, which needs to be calculated as 20/100 x $100 = $20.
- When interpreting data: Students might misinterpret statistical data, such as a survey result showing that 20 people out of 50 agree with a statement, and incorrectly conclude that 20% of people agree, without realizing that the actual percentage is 40% (20/50 x 100).
- When solving problems involving interest rates: A student might think that an interest rate of 5 means that $5 will be added to the principal amount, without understanding that the interest rate is actually 5% of the principal amount, which needs to be calculated as 5/100 x principal amount."
2040,Has estimated the length of the missing side length by looking at the image  rather than calculating it,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students rely on visual inspection to estimate the length of a missing side in a geometric shape, rather than using mathematical calculations or theorems to determine the exact length. This can occur when students are working with various shapes, such as triangles, rectangles, or trapezoids, and are asked to find the length of a missing side.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a right-angled triangle, students may estimate the length of the hypotenuse by looking at the lengths of the other two sides, rather than using the Pythagorean theorem to calculate it.
- Case 2: When working with similar triangles, students may try to estimate the length of a missing side by visually comparing the lengths of corresponding sides, rather than using the concept of similarity to calculate the exact length.
- Case 3: In a rectangle with missing side lengths, students may estimate the length of the missing side by looking at the lengths of the other sides, rather than using the properties of rectangles to determine the exact length."
2041,Fails to reflect across reflection line without a diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to reflect a shape or a point across a reflection line (also known as a line of symmetry) without the aid of a diagram. They may struggle to visualize the reflection process and fail to understand that reflecting a point or shape across a line involves creating a mirror image on the opposite side of the line. 

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Reflecting only part of the shape or point, rather than the entire thing
- Failing to account for the change in orientation or position of the reflected shape or point
- Assuming that the reflection is the same as a rotation or translation
- Difficulty in understanding the concept of a line of symmetry and how it relates to reflection

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

- Case 1: A student is asked to reflect the point (3, 4) across the x-axis without graphing it. They may struggle to understand that the reflected point will have the same x-coordinate but a negative y-coordinate.
- Case 2: A student is given a triangle with vertices (0, 0), (2, 0), and (1, 2) and asked to reflect it across the y-axis without drawing a diagram. They may have trouble visualizing the reflected triangle and its new coordinates.
- Case 3: A student is asked to describe the reflection of a shape across a diagonal line without seeing the shape or line. They may find it challenging to explain the process and the resulting shape without visual aids."
2042,Can not square root a negative number,"Explanation: This misconception arises from the fact that students are initially taught that the square of any number is always positive (or zero). For example, 5 squared is 25 and (-5) squared is also 25. When students are introduced to square roots, they might assume that since the result of squaring is always positive, it is impossible to find the square root of a negative number. They may not understand that the concept of square roots can be extended to include complex numbers, which can have negative values under the radical sign.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When solving quadratic equations with negative discriminants, such as x^2 + 4 = 0, students might think there are no solutions.
- When dealing with imaginary numbers, students may struggle to understand how to simplify expressions like √(-4) or √(-9).
- In algebra, when solving equations that involve the square root of a negative number, students may incorrectly conclude that there are no solutions or that the equation is invalid."
2043,Selects y>a solutions instead of y<a solutions for a quadratic inequality,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are solving quadratic inequalities of the form y < ax^2 + bx + c or y > ax^2 + bx + c. The students may incorrectly choose the solutions that are above the parabola (y > a) instead of below the parabola (y < a) or vice versa, depending on the inequality. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the inequality sign and the region of the graph that represents the solution.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When solving quadratic inequalities with complex graphs, students might get confused about which region to shade.
- When the inequality sign is changed (e.g., from y < to y >), students may forget to adjust the region of the solution accordingly.
- When the quadratic equation has a negative leading coefficient (a < 0), students might get confused about the direction of the parabola and choose the wrong region.
- When solving real-world problems, students may misinterpret the context and incorrectly choose the solutions that do not satisfy the given conditions."
2044,Does not know the units column is before the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully aware of the positional value of digits within a number, particularly in decimal numbers. They may mistakenly believe that the units column is after the decimal point or have confusion about the placement of the decimal point in relation to the units column. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of exposure to decimal numbers or inadequate practice in reading and writing numbers with decimal points.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading or writing decimal numbers, students may incorrectly identify the position of the units column, leading to errors in calculations or comparisons.
- In measurement problems, students may misinterpret the units of measurement (e.g., meters, centimeters, or millimeters) in relation to the decimal point, resulting in incorrect conversions or calculations.
- When performing arithmetic operations involving decimals, such as addition or subtraction, students may misalign the decimal points or incorrectly place the units column, leading to incorrect answers.
- In real-world applications, such as handling money or measuring ingredients, students may struggle with accurately interpreting decimal quantities due to their misconception about the units column."
2045,Writes a variable to the power of n as nx,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of exponentiation. They may think that a variable written to the power of 'n' (e.g., x^n) is equivalent to multiplying the variable by 'n' (e.g., nx). This indicates a lack of understanding of the exponentiation operation, where the exponent 'n' represents the number of times the base (variable) is multiplied by itself, not the multiplier itself.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as x^3, students may write it as 3x.
- When solving equations, such as x^2 = 16, students may rewrite it as 2x = 16.
- When working with geometric sequences or series, students may incorrectly apply the exponent to the variable instead of raising the variable to the power of the exponent."
2046,"When collecting like terms, treats subtractions as if they are additions","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are collecting like terms in algebraic expressions. They may incorrectly assume that subtracting a term is the same as adding it, and therefore combine the terms as if they were all additions. For example, when collecting like terms in the expression ""3x - 2x + 5x"", a student with this misconception might treat the subtraction of 2x as an addition, resulting in an incorrect simplification.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying expressions with multiple like terms, such as ""5x - 3x + 2x""
- Combining coefficients of like terms, such as ""2x - x + 4x""
- Solving linear equations with like terms, such as ""2x - x = 5""
- Expanding and simplifying algebraic expressions, such as ""(2x - 1) + (x + 3)"""
2047,Believes infinite gradient is not possible in real life. ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the concept of infinite or undefined gradient (also known as slope) in a purely practical sense. They may believe that in real-life situations, it's impossible to have a vertical line or an infinite gradient, as it would imply a physical object or a natural phenomenon with an impossible incline. They might think that all real-world applications of gradients must have a finite and measurable value.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing the steepness of a cliff or a vertical wall, students may assume that the incline cannot be truly vertical, and therefore, the gradient cannot be infinite.
- When working with real-world data, such as the relationship between the height of a building and the horizontal distance from its base, students may believe that there must be a finite and measurable gradient, even if the relationship appears to be vertical.
- When solving problems involving motion along a vertical line, such as the trajectory of a projectile under the sole influence of gravity, students may assume that the gradient of the trajectory cannot be infinite, even if the object is moving vertically upwards or downwards."
2048,Has not noticed the difference between 'subtract' and 'subtract from',"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the distinction between two different phrases: 'subtract' and 'subtract from'. 'Subtract' typically means to take away a certain quantity from another, often denoted as a - b, where 'a' is the initial quantity and 'b' is the quantity being subtracted. On the other hand, 'subtract from' implies the opposite order of subtraction, i.e., b is being subtracted from something else, often denoted as b being subtracted from a, but in reverse order, so it is b - a.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- In word problems: ""If Sara has 15 pencils and she gives 3 to her friend, how many pencils does Sara have left if 7 pencils are subtracted from her?"" versus ""If Sara has 15 pencils and 7 pencils are subtracted, then she gives 3 to her friend, how many pencils does Sara have left?""
- In number sequences: ""Start with 10 and subtract 3, then subtract 2 from that result"" versus ""Start with 10 and subtract 2 from it, then subtract 3.""
- In story problems involving money or time: ""Tom has $15 and spends $5 on a snack. If $2 is subtracted from his remaining money, how much is left?"" versus ""Tom has $15, then $2 is subtracted from his money, and then he spends $5 on a snack."""
2049,Believes a gap of 2 is a gap of 1 on a numberline,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of a number line and accurately counting the gaps or intervals between numbers. A number line is a visual representation of numbers in a sequence, with each point on the line corresponding to a specific number. However, students with this misconception may not fully grasp that each gap or interval between two consecutive numbers on a number line represents a unit increase or decrease of 1.

When counting gaps, they might mistakenly consider the distance between two consecutive numbers as one gap, instead of recognizing the space between each number as one unit. For example, if a student starts at 0 and moves to 2, they may count the gap as 1, instead of understanding that there are two gaps or units (0 to 1 and 1 to 2).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Counting intervals: A student is asked to count how many gaps there are between the numbers 5 and 9 on a number line. They may incorrectly answer 3, instead of recognizing the individual gaps between 5 and 6, 6 and 7, 7 and 8, and 8 and 9, which would be 4 gaps.

2. Basic addition and subtraction: A student is asked to calculate 7 + 2 on a number line. They may incorrectly count 1 gap from 7 to 9, instead of recognizing that there are two gaps: 7 to 8 and 8 to 9.

3. Number patterns: A student is asked to identify a pattern on a number line, such as counting by 2s (2, 4, 6, 8, ...). They may incorrectly count the gaps between the numbers, leading to an incorrect understanding of the pattern."
2050,Does not recognise a unit of length,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students do not understand or recognize the different units of length, such as meters (m), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), kilometers (km), etc. They may not be able to identify which unit is being referred to or used in a given context, leading to confusion and incorrect calculations.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Not being able to differentiate between similar-sounding units (e.g., millimeters vs. meters).
- Not recognizing the relationship between different units (e.g., 1 meter = 100 centimeters).
- Not understanding the context in which a particular unit is used (e.g., kilometers for long distances, millimeters for small measurements).
- Not being able to convert between units (e.g., converting 10 meters to centimeters).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A student is asked to measure the length of a room and records it as 10 units without specifying the unit.
2. A student is given a recipe that calls for 250 mm of sugar, but they use 250 cm instead.
3. A student is asked to convert 5 km to meters, but they do not know the relationship between the two units.
4. A student is asked to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle with sides of 5 cm and 3 cm, but they use meters instead of centimeters."
2051,Does not correctly apply the commutative property of multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that changing the order of the factors in a multiplication operation will change the result, or they may not recognize that the order of the factors does not affect the product. In other words, students may not fully understand that the commutative property of multiplication states that a × b = b × a.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When multiplying two numbers, students may think that the larger number must be written first.
- Students may believe that the order of the factors affects the result, e.g., 2 × 5 ≠ 5 × 2.
- When solving multiplication word problems, students may think that the order of the factors is determined by the order in which the quantities are mentioned in the problem.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to calculate 3 × 4, and they insist that the correct calculation is 4 × 3, believing that the larger number must be written first.
- Case 2: A student is given the equation 2 × 6 = ?, and they respond that the answer would be different if the equation were written as 6 × 2.
- Case 3: A student is solving a word problem that involves multiplying the number of groups by the number of items per group. They may think that the order of the factors is determined by the order in which the quantities are mentioned in the problem, rather than recognizing that the commutative property of multiplication allows them to multiply the numbers in either order."
2052,Believes all numbers written in standard form must be smaller than any numbers written in ordinary form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to standard form (also known as scientific notation) for the first time. They may assume that because the numbers are written in a more compact form with exponents, they must be smaller in value. This misconception may stem from the fact that students often initially learn about standard form in the context of very large or very small numbers, leading them to associate standard form with tiny or enormous values. However, they fail to understand that standard form is simply a way of expressing numbers, and the actual value of the number remains the same regardless of the notation used.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* Comparing the size of numbers, e.g., 4.5 x 10^3 and 4500, where the student may think 4.5 x 10^3 is smaller because it's in standard form.
* Ordering numbers in ascending or descending order, where students may incorrectly place numbers in standard form at the beginning or end of the list.
* Solving inequalities or comparing the size of numbers in algebraic expressions, where students may misinterpret the value of numbers in standard form."
2053,"When reading integers on a number line, assumes each dash is 1","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to number lines and they fail to understand the concept of scale. They assume that each dash or mark on the number line represents a single unit, regardless of the actual scale. This can lead to incorrect readings of integers on the number line. For example, if a number line has dashes marked at every 5 units, a student with this misconception would assume that each dash represents 1 unit, resulting in incorrect identification of integers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When identifying the position of a number on a number line with a scale greater than 1 (e.g., a number line with dashes marked at every 5 or 10 units).
- When counting on or back by a certain number of units on a number line with a scale that is not equal to 1.
- When comparing the positions of two numbers on a number line with different scales.
- When reading the position of a number on a number line with missing or irregularly spaced dashes.
- When interpreting the position of zero on a number line with a scale that is not equal to 1."
2054,Believes the number of jumps between two numbers on a numberline represents the sum of those 2 numbers ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of a number line and how it represents relationships between numbers. They may think that the number of jumps or units between two numbers on the number line represents the sum of those two numbers, rather than the actual difference between them.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to find the sum of 5 and 8, a student might count the 3 jumps between 5 and 8 on the number line and assume that the sum is 3, or they might count all the units from 0 to 5 and from 0 to 8 and add them together.
- When comparing the difference between two numbers, such as 10 and 6, a student might count the 4 jumps between 6 and 10 and assume that the sum of 10 and 6 is 4, rather than understanding that the difference between the two numbers is 4.
- When solving simple addition or subtraction problems, such as 4 + 2 or 9 - 3, a student might use the number line to count the jumps between the numbers and assume that the answer is the number of jumps, rather than the actual result of the calculation."
2055,"When multiplying a decimal by an integer, ignores decimal point and just multiplies the digits","Explanation: This misconception arises when students treat decimal numbers as whole numbers, disregarding the decimal point's significance. They may simply multiply the digits together, as they would with whole numbers, without considering the place value of the decimal. For example, when multiplying 3.5 by 4, a student with this misconception might calculate 3 x 4 = 12 and 5 x 4 = 20, then write the answer as 120 or 125, ignoring the correct placement of the decimal point.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- 2.5 x 3: A student might calculate 2 x 3 = 6 and 5 x 3 = 15, resulting in an incorrect answer of 615 or 65.
- 4.2 x 2: A student might calculate 4 x 2 = 8 and 2 x 2 = 4, resulting in an incorrect answer of 84 or 82.
- 1.8 x 5: A student might calculate 1 x 5 = 5 and 8 x 5 = 40, resulting in an incorrect answer of 405 or 45."
2056,"When calculating surface area, only includes visible faces","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the surface area of a 3D object and mistakenly believe that only the visible or outer faces of the object contribute to its total surface area. They may overlook the fact that the object has other faces that are not visible but still have an area. This can lead to an incomplete calculation and an incorrect answer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the surface area of a cube or a rectangular prism that is partially buried in the ground or hidden from view.
- When calculating the surface area of a hollow object, such as a box or a container, where students might ignore the inner surfaces.
- When determining the surface area of a complex shape, such as a building or a bridge, where some faces may be obscured or not immediately visible."
2057,Thinks that the scale on axes has to match with the number of squares,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the scale on the axes of a graph must directly correspond to the number of squares or units marked on the axes. They may think that if there are 10 squares on the x-axis, then each square must represent one unit of the variable being plotted. This misconception can lead to incorrect graphing and interpretation of data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing a graph with different scales for the x and y axes, students may insist that the number of squares on each axis must match the scale.
- When working with graphs that have non-standard scales, such as 2 cm representing 5 units, students may struggle to understand why the number of squares doesn't match the scale.
- When graphing data with large or small numbers, students may incorrectly assume that the scale must match the number of squares, leading to inaccurate graphs.
- When comparing multiple graphs with different scales, students may be confused if the number of squares doesn't match between graphs, even if the scales are different."
2058,Assumes there are only 2 terms in the nth term formula for a quadratic sequence,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of quadratic sequences and the nth term formula. They may mistakenly believe that a quadratic sequence's nth term formula only consists of two terms, similar to a linear sequence, rather than recognizing that it typically involves three terms: a quadratic term (involving n^2), a linear term (involving n), and a constant term.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the nth term formula for a quadratic sequence and they only provide a formula with two terms, such as 2n + 3, instead of a formula with three terms, like n^2 + 2n + 3.
- When students are given a quadratic sequence and are asked to identify the pattern, but they fail to recognize the quadratic term and only identify a linear pattern.
- When students are solving problems involving quadratic sequences and consistently apply a two-term formula, leading to incorrect results.
- When students are asked to generate a quadratic sequence and they produce a sequence that can be represented by a two-term formula, rather than a three-term formula."
2059,Ignores unlabelled angles when applying angle sum rules,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard unlabelled angles in a diagram when applying angle sum rules, such as the sum of interior angles in a triangle (180°) or the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral (360°). They may only consider the labelled angles and ignore the unlabelled ones, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- In a triangle, two angles are given as 60° and 70°, but the third angle is not labelled. The student may assume the sum of the two given angles is the total sum of the interior angles.
- In a quadrilateral, three angles are labelled as 90°, 90°, and 120°, but the fourth angle is not labelled. The student may ignore the unlabelled angle and calculate the sum of the labelled angles as 300°, instead of considering all four angles to find the correct sum of 360°.
- In a problem involving an irregular polygon, some angles are labelled, while others are not. The student may only use the labelled angles to calculate the sum of the interior angles, neglecting the unlabelled ones and arriving at an incorrect solution."
2060,"When solving simultaneous equations graphically, they think the solutions are the x or y intercepts","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations graphically. They may mistakenly believe that the solutions to the system of equations are the x or y intercepts of the individual lines, rather than the point of intersection between the two lines. This misunderstanding may be due to an overemphasis on finding intercepts in previous lessons or a lack of understanding of the concept of simultaneous equations.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* When graphing two linear equations, students may identify the x-intercept of one line and the y-intercept of the other line as the solutions, rather than looking for the point where the two lines intersect.
* When dealing with simple linear equations, such as y = x and y = 2x, students may mistakenly think that the solutions are the points where the lines cross the axes, rather than the point where the two lines intersect.
* When solving word problems that involve simultaneous equations, students may misinterpret the graphical representation of the problem and identify the intercepts as the solutions, rather than the point of intersection that represents the solution to the problem."
2061,"Believes that when converting ratio to fractions, the denominator is the difference between the parts of the ratio","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of ratios and fractions. They think that when converting a ratio to a fraction, the denominator is the difference between the parts of the ratio, rather than the total number of parts. For example, if a ratio is 3:4, they might think that the fraction is 3/(4-3) instead of 3/(3+4). This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between ratios and fractions, and how to convert between the two.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When converting a ratio of 2:5 to a fraction, the student might write 2/(5-2) instead of 2/(2+5).
- When simplifying a ratio of 4:6 to a fraction, the student might write 4/(6-4) instead of 4/(4+6).
- When comparing ratios, such as 3:4 and 2:5, the student might incorrectly convert both ratios to fractions using the difference between the parts, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- When solving problems involving proportional reasoning, such as scaling recipes or dividing quantities, the student's misconception may lead to incorrect calculations and answers."
2062,Believes you multiply all of the values given when using the capture-recapture sampling method,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the capture-recapture sampling method, which is used to estimate population sizes. They mistakenly believe that to find the total population, they need to multiply all the given values, such as the number of individuals initially captured, the number of individuals recaptured, and the total number of individuals caught in the second sample. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the method's underlying principles, such as the concept of ratios and proportions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are given a problem involving the capture-recapture method and are asked to estimate the total population size, they might multiply the initial capture, recapture, and second sample numbers.
- In a scenario where students are conducting a field study using the capture-recapture method, they may incorrectly calculate the population size by multiplying the given values, leading to an inaccurate estimate.
- When analyzing data from a capture-recapture experiment, students might multiply the values instead of applying the correct formula, resulting in incorrect conclusions about the population size."
2063,"When calculating volume expressed in cubes, counts the faces of all the cubes","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the volume of a 3D shape made up of cubes. Instead of counting the number of cubes, they incorrectly count the faces of all the cubes. This can lead to an overcount, as each cube has 6 faces. Students may mistakenly believe that the volume is the sum of the number of faces, rather than the number of cubes.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* A rectangular prism made up of 5 cubes in a row is presented, and the student counts the faces of each cube (30 faces) instead of counting the cubes themselves (5 cubes).
* A student is asked to find the volume of a cube tower with 3 layers of 4 cubes each, and they count the faces of each cube (72 faces) instead of counting the total number of cubes (12 cubes).
* A 3D shape composed of multiple connected cubes is given, and the student incorrectly counts the faces of each cube, resulting in an overcount of the volume."
2064,"Finds the range of possible values of the variable, rather than the range of recorded values","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the range in a dataset. Instead of finding the difference between the largest and smallest recorded values, they consider all possible values that the variable could take. This leads them to calculate the range based on the entire potential range of the variable, rather than the actual range of values present in the data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a dataset of exam scores, a student is asked to find the range of scores. Instead of subtracting the lowest score from the highest score, they calculate the range as the difference between the maximum possible score (e.g., 100) and the minimum possible score (e.g., 0).
- Case 2: A student is given a dataset of temperatures recorded over a week and is asked to find the range of temperatures. Instead of finding the difference between the highest and lowest recorded temperatures, they consider the entire possible range of temperatures (e.g., from -273°C to 100°C).
- Case 3: A student is analyzing a dataset of ages of people in a class and is asked to find the range of ages. Instead of finding the difference between the oldest and youngest person, they calculate the range as the difference between the maximum possible age (e.g., 120) and the minimum possible age (e.g., 0)."
2065,Believes when calculating a probability the denominator will be the total of one of the criteria rather than the overall total that is required (gives a given that answer),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating probabilities and incorrectly identify the denominator as the total of one specific category or criterion, rather than the overall total number of outcomes or sample space. For example, if a student is asked to find the probability of selecting a red car from a set of cars, where there are 10 red cars and 20 cars in total, they may incorrectly use the total number of non-red cars (10) or the total number of another category (e.g. blue cars) as the denominator, instead of the overall total of 20 cars.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: In a class of 30 students, 15 are boys and 10 of them like football. If a student is asked to find the probability of selecting a boy who likes football, they may use the total number of girls (15) or the total number of boys who don't like football (5) as the denominator, instead of the overall total of 30 students.
- Case 2: A survey found that 50 people like pizza, 30 people like sushi, and 20 people like both. If a student is asked to find the probability of selecting someone who likes pizza, they may use the total number of people who like sushi (30) or the total number of people who like both (20) as the denominator, instead of the overall total number of people surveyed.
- Case 3: A bag contains 5 red marbles, 3 blue marbles, and 2 green marbles. If a student is asked to find the probability of selecting a red marble, they may use the total number of non-red marbles (5) or the total number of blue marbles (3) as the denominator, instead of the overall total of 10 marbles."
2066,Does not know multiplying by a unit fraction is equivalent to: dividing by its denominator value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the relationship between multiplication and division, particularly with fractions. They may believe that multiplying by a unit fraction (a fraction with a numerator of 1) is a completely different operation, rather than recognizing it as equivalent to dividing by the denominator. For instance, they may not realize that multiplying by 1/2 is the same as dividing by 2. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in various mathematical operations and problem-solving.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Simplifying expressions: A student may struggle to simplify expressions like 6 × (1/3) and may not recognize it as equivalent to 6 ÷ 3.

2. Fraction word problems: When faced with word problems involving fractions, such as ""Tom has 12 cookies and wants to share them equally among 4 friends, how many cookies will each friend get?"", a student with this misconception may not realize that they can multiply 12 by 1/4 or divide 12 by 4 to find the answer.

3. Conversion between fractions and decimals: A student may have difficulty converting fractions to decimals or vice versa, as they may not understand that multiplying by a unit fraction is equivalent to dividing by its denominator, which is essential for these conversions.

4. Real-world applications: In everyday situations, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a quantity among a group of people, a student with this misconception may not be able to accurately calculate the required amounts or quantities."
2067,Thinks there are 10000ml in a litre,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 10,000 milliliters (mL) in 1 liter. This might be due to their misunderstanding of the conversion between units of measurement, particularly between milliliters and liters. Students may have difficulty grasping the concept that 1 liter is actually equal to 1,000 milliliters, not 10,000.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to convert liters to milliliters, they may incorrectly multiply by 10,000 instead of 1,000.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring liquids for cooking or scientific experiments, students may use the incorrect conversion factor, leading to inaccurate results.
- When solving problems involving capacity or volume, students may incorrectly assume that 1 liter is equal to 10,000 milliliters, affecting their calculations and conclusions."
2068,"Does not know that to factorise a quadratic expression, to find two numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term, and multiply to give the non variable term

","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize the relationship between the coefficients of a quadratic expression in the form ax^2 + bx + c and the numbers required to factorise it. They may not understand that to factorise a quadratic expression, they need to find two numbers whose sum equals the coefficient of the x term (b) and whose product equals the constant term (c). This indicates a lack of understanding of the underlying algebraic structure of quadratic expressions and the factoring process.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising a simple quadratic expression, such as x^2 + 5x + 6, where the student may not be able to identify the correct numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term (5) and multiply to give the constant term (6).
- Factorising a quadratic expression with negative coefficients, such as x^2 - 7x + 12, where the student may struggle to find the correct numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term (-7) and multiply to give the constant term (12).
- Factorising a quadratic expression with a non-integer coefficient of x, such as x^2 + 2.5x + 1, where the student may find it challenging to identify the correct numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term (2.5) and multiply to give the constant term (1)."
2069,"Believes if there are two numbers with the same frequency, there isn't a mode","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are taught that the mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. However, they may misinterpret this to mean that if there are multiple values with the same highest frequency, then there is no mode. They may believe that the mode must be a single, unique value, and if there are multiple values tied for the highest frequency, then the dataset does not have a mode.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is given a dataset of exam scores where two scores, 80 and 90, both appear 5 times, which is more than any other score. The student may conclude that since both scores appear with the same frequency, there is no mode for the dataset.

- Case 2: A class conducts a survey on favorite colors, and the results show that both blue and green are chosen by 10 students, while all other colors are chosen by fewer students. A student with this misconception may claim that there is no mode for the favorite colors, since blue and green are tied for the highest frequency.

- Case 3: A student collects data on the number of hours spent watching TV per day, and finds that both 2 hours and 3 hours are reported by 7 people, which is more than any other number of hours. The student may believe that since 2 hours and 3 hours have the same frequency, the dataset does not have a mode."
2070,"Believes that when factorising a quadratic equation with a coefficient of x squared, the two constants in the brackets are still the solutions of the equation with opposite signs","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorising quadratic equations and initially learn that for simple equations of the form x^2 + bx + c = 0, the factors (x + p)(x + q) give solutions p and q (with opposite signs due to the way they are arranged in the equation). However, when a coefficient is introduced in front of the x^2 term, i.e., ax^2 + bx + c = 0, students may incorrectly assume that the same logic still applies, thinking that the constants within the brackets of the factorised form will directly provide the solutions of the equation, simply with opposite signs.

This misconception indicates a lack of understanding of how the coefficient of x^2 affects the factorisation and the subsequent solutions of the equation.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Factorising the equation 2x^2 + 7x + 3 = 0, a student might write (2x + 1)(x + 3) = 0 and incorrectly assume the solutions are -1 and -3.
2. Factorising the equation 3x^2 + 10x + 3 = 0, a student might write (3x + 1)(x + 3) = 0 and incorrectly assume the solutions are -1/3 and -3.
3. Factorising the equation 4x^2 + 5x + 1 = 0, a student might write (4x + 1)(x + 1) = 0 and incorrectly assume the solutions are -1/4 and -1."
2071,Shares equally instead of in given ratio,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to divide a quantity into a given ratio, but instead, they divide it equally among the parts. They struggle to understand that a ratio is a comparison of two or more quantities and that it doesn't always imply equal sharing. Students may think that the parts in a ratio must be equal because they are used to dividing things equally in other mathematical contexts, such as sharing objects among friends.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dividing a pizza among friends in a 2:3 ratio, a student might divide it into 5 equal parts, instead of giving 2 parts to one group and 3 parts to the other.
- When sharing a bag of candies in a 3:5 ratio, a student might give an equal number of candies to each person, instead of giving 3 parts to one person and 5 parts to the other.
- When solving a problem that involves dividing a certain amount of money between two people in a 4:6 ratio, a student might divide the money equally between the two people, instead of giving 4 parts to one person and 6 parts to the other."
2072,Confuses formulae for area of triangle and area of rectangle,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the formula for the area of a rectangle (length x width) to find the area of a triangle, or vice versa, using the formula for the area of a triangle (1/2 x base x height) to find the area of a rectangle. 

This misconception often arises because students may not fully understand the conceptual differences between these two shapes or may not be able to recall the correct formula for each shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When finding the area of a right-angled triangle, students might multiply the base and height without dividing by 2, treating it like a rectangle.
- Case 2: When finding the area of a rectangle with one side labeled as 'base' and the other as 'height', students might mistakenly apply the triangle formula, dividing the product by 2.
- Case 3: In a real-world application, students might be asked to find the area of a triangular roof or a rectangular garden. If they are not careful, they might apply the wrong formula due to this misconception.
- Case 4: In a problem involving a composite shape consisting of both triangles and rectangles, students may get confused and apply the wrong formula for one or both shapes."
2073,Converts a fraction to a decimal by placing all values of the fraction after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of converting a fraction to a decimal. They incorrectly assume that to convert a fraction to a decimal, they simply need to place all the values of the fraction (numerator and denominator) after the decimal point. For example, when converting the fraction 3/4 to a decimal, they would incorrectly write it as 3.4, instead of dividing the numerator by the denominator.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* Converting simple fractions like 1/2, where students might write 1.2 instead of 0.5.
* Converting mixed numbers like 2 3/4, where students might write 2.3.4 instead of 2.75.
* Converting improper fractions like 5/4, where students might write 5.4 instead of 1.25.
* Real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, where students might incorrectly convert fractional quantities to decimal quantities, leading to inaccurate measurements."
2074,"When describing the relationship between the parts in a ratio, replaces the : with a decimal point to say how many times bigger a part is than the other","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the notation used to express ratios. They may incorrectly believe that the colon (:) in a ratio can be replaced with a decimal point to represent the relative size of the parts. For instance, if a ratio is expressed as 3:4, students with this misconception may think that one part is 3.4 times bigger than the other, rather than understanding that the ratio is comparing the number of parts, not their size.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the number of boys to girls in a class, a student might say ""the ratio of boys to girls is 2.5"" instead of ""the ratio of boys to girls is 2:5 or 2 to 5"".
- When scaling a recipe, a student might misinterpret a ratio of 3:4 (e.g., 3 cups of flour to 4 cups of water) and say ""we need 3.4 times more water than flour"" instead of understanding that for every 3 parts of flour, we need 4 parts of water.
- When describing the dimensions of a rectangle, a student might say ""the ratio of the width to the length is 2.3"" instead of ""the ratio of the width to the length is 2:3 or 2 to 3""."
2075,Misunderstands mixed number notation ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students interpret mixed numbers as separate, unrelated numbers rather than a single quantity. A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a fraction, but students with this misconception may treat the whole number and fraction parts independently, rather than understanding that they represent a single value.

For example, when given the mixed number 3 1/2, students with this misconception might:

- Add or subtract the whole number and fraction parts separately, rather than considering them as a single quantity.
- Compare the whole number parts separately and the fraction parts separately, rather than comparing the entire mixed numbers.
- Fail to recognize that 3 1/2 is equal to 7/2 or 3.5, and instead think of it as two distinct numbers, 3 and 1/2.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When adding or subtracting mixed numbers, such as 2 1/4 + 1 3/4.
- Case 2: When comparing mixed numbers, such as determining which is larger, 2 3/4 or 3 1/4.
- Case 3: When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions or decimals, such as converting 2 1/2 to an improper fraction or decimal."
2076,Believes an algebraic term with the same coefficient as the value of a constant term can be subtracted to give zero,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of like terms in algebra. They may believe that if an algebraic term, such as 3x, has the same coefficient (3) as a constant term (3), they can subtract the two terms to get zero. This is because they may think that the coefficient and the constant are equivalent and can be cancelled out. 

For example, in the expression 3x + 3, a student with this misconception may believe that they can subtract 3x from 3 to get zero, resulting in an incorrect simplification of the expression. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Simplifying expressions: 2x + 2 = 0 (student may think 2x can be subtracted from 2 to get zero)
- Solving equations: x + 4 = 4 (student may think x can be subtracted from 4 to get zero)
- Expanding and simplifying algebraic expressions: 2(x + 2) = 2x + 2 (student may think 2x can be subtracted from 2 to get zero)"
2077,"Believes that when eliminating a variable, if the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are different, we subtract the equations.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to solve systems of linear equations using the method of elimination. They may believe that if the coefficients of the variable to be eliminated are the same but have different signs in the two equations, they need to subtract the equations to eliminate the variable. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect solutions and incorrect application of the elimination method.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When the coefficients of the variable to be eliminated are additive inverses (e.g., +2 and -2), students may incorrectly assume that subtraction is the correct operation to eliminate the variable.
- When the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are different, but the coefficients are not the same (e.g., +2 and -3), students may still attempt to subtract the equations, leading to incorrect results.
- When dealing with equations that have multiple variables and constants, students may get confused and apply the incorrect operation (subtraction) due to the presence of different signs on the coefficients."
2078,Simplifies a fraction by adding or subtracting the same amount from the numerator  and denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that they can simplify a fraction by adding or subtracting the same number from both the numerator and the denominator. They may think that this operation maintains the equivalence of the fraction, which is not true. For example, they may think that simplifying the fraction 4/6 can be done by subtracting 2 from both the numerator and the denominator, resulting in the incorrect simplified fraction 2/4.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Simplifying fractions with like numerators and denominators: When simplifying fractions like 5/7, students may add or subtract the same number from both the numerator and the denominator, thinking it will simplify the fraction.
- Comparing fractions: When comparing fractions like 3/5 and 2/4, students may add or subtract the same number from both the numerator and the denominator of one or both fractions to make a comparison, which will lead to incorrect results.
- Adding or subtracting fractions: When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, students may add or subtract the same number from both the numerator and the denominator to make the denominators the same, resulting in incorrect calculations.
- Real-world applications: In real-world scenarios, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a quantity into equal parts, students may apply this misconception, leading to inaccurate results."
2079,Believes that points on an axis have equal x and y coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that any point lying on either the x-axis or y-axis has equal x and y coordinates. They might think that because the point is on the axis, the other coordinate must be the same. For example, if a point lies on the x-axis, they might believe that the y-coordinate must be the same as the x-coordinate, and vice versa.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When plotting points on a graph, students might incorrectly assume that a point on the x-axis, such as (3,0), has equal x and y coordinates, writing it as (3,3).
- When solving equations, students might think that if a point lies on the y-axis, such as (0,4), the x-coordinate must also be 4, writing it as (4,4).
- When interpreting graphs, students might mistakenly believe that a point on the x-axis has the same x and y coordinates, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between the variables."
2080,Confuses the y-intercept with the turning point of a curve,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the y-intercept and the turning point (also known as the vertex) of a quadratic curve. They often incorrectly assume that the y-intercept is the lowest or highest point on the curve, which is actually the turning point. This confusion can lead to incorrect interpretations and calculations when analyzing and graphing quadratic functions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing a quadratic equation, a student marks the y-intercept as the turning point, or vice versa.
- When finding the minimum or maximum value of a quadratic function, a student mistakenly uses the y-intercept instead of the turning point.
- When interpreting the graph of a quadratic function, a student incorrectly identifies the y-intercept as the point where the curve changes direction, rather than the turning point.
- When solving quadratic equations, a student may incorrectly apply the y-intercept to find the roots or solutions of the equation, instead of using the correct mathematical methods."
2081,Thinks there are 7 hours in 1 day,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of time and its units. They may be familiar with the idea of a 7-day week, but they incorrectly apply this knowledge to the number of hours in a day. As a result, they mistakenly believe that there are 7 hours in a day, rather than 24 hours. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the number of hours in a given time period, such as the number of hours in a school day.
- When students are required to create schedules or timetables, and they allocate only 7 hours for the entire day.
- When students are solving word problems that involve time, such as calculating the time it takes to complete a task or travel a certain distance.
- When students are asked to convert between different units of time, such as converting days to hours or hours to minutes."
2082,"When multiplying a surd by an integer, multiplies the integer with the number under the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the properties of surds. A surd is a root of a number that cannot be simplified into a whole number, often represented by the radical sign (√). When multiplying a surd by an integer, students may incorrectly assume that they should multiply the integer with the number under the surd (the radicand). For example, they might think that 3 * √4 = √(3*4) = √12, or that 2 * √5 = √(2*5) = √10.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying a surd by a coefficient in an algebraic expression: 2 * √x
- Scaling a surd in a geometric problem: finding the length of a side of a scaled-up triangle with surd lengths
- Simplifying expressions in trigonometry: 2 * √3 in the context of a trigonometric identity
- Evaluating numerical expressions: 4 * √2 in a numerical calculation."
2083,Thinks y =1 is the y axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the line y = 1 represents the y-axis on a coordinate plane. They may think that the y-axis is a line that has a constant value of y, such as y = 1, rather than understanding that the y-axis is actually the vertical line where x = 0 and y can take on any value.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When graphing linear equations, students may incorrectly plot the line y = 1 as the y-axis, leading to incorrect graphs.
- When solving systems of equations, students may mistakenly think that the solution to the system is the point where the line y = 1 intersects with another line, rather than finding the actual point of intersection.
- When working with functions, students may incorrectly identify the y-intercept of a function as the point where the line y = 1 intersects with the function, rather than finding the actual y-intercept where the function crosses the y-axis (x = 0).
- When interpreting graphs, students may mistakenly think that a line that intersects the line y = 1 is actually intersecting the y-axis, leading to incorrect conclusions about the data or relationships being represented."
2084,"When multiplying numbers with different bases, multiplies the powers and multiplies the base numbers.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the rule of multiplying numbers with the same base, where they are told to add the powers. However, when dealing with numbers with different bases, some students incorrectly extend this rule by multiplying the powers and multiplying the base numbers. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties of exponents and the rules of multiplying numbers with different bases.

For example, when given a problem like:

* 2^3 × 3^4, students with this misconception might answer (2 × 3)^(3 × 4) = 6^12, instead of recognizing that the bases are different and require a different approach.
* 4^2 × 5^3, students with this misconception might answer (4 × 5)^(2 × 3) = 20^6, again incorrectly applying the rule for same bases to different bases.
* 2^5 × 6^2, students with this misconception might answer (2 × 6)^(5 × 2) = 12^10, demonstrating a misunderstanding of how to handle different bases when multiplying numbers with exponents."
2085,Adds instead of multiplies when multiplying algebraic terms,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students treat the multiplication of algebraic terms as an addition operation, rather than recognizing that the terms need to be multiplied. For example, when multiplying 2x and 3x, students with this misconception may add the coefficients (2 + 3) and keep the variable (x), resulting in 5x instead of the correct product of 6x^2.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Multiplying two or more variables with coefficients, such as 2x * 3x or 4y * 2y.
- Multiplying a variable by an expression containing the same variable, such as 2x * (3x + 2) or x * (2x - 1).
- Expanding expressions with multiple terms, such as (2x + 1) * (3x + 2) or (x + 2) * (x - 1)."
2086,"When calculating volume expressed in cubes, counts only the squares on one face","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to calculate the volume of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a rectangular prism, expressed in cubic units. They tend to focus only on the number of squares on one face of the shape, rather than considering the number of layers or the depth of the shape. As a result, they may incorrectly calculate the volume by counting only the squares on one face, rather than multiplying the number of squares on the face by the number of layers or the depth.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the volume of a cube, a student may count only the squares on one face (e.g., 4 squares on one face of a 2x2x2 cube) and report that as the volume, rather than multiplying the number of squares on the face by the number of layers (e.g., 4 squares x 2 layers = 8 cubic units).
- When calculating the volume of a rectangular prism, a student may count only the squares on the front face (e.g., 6 squares on the front face of a 3x2x2 prism) and report that as the volume, rather than multiplying the number of squares on the face by the number of layers (e.g., 6 squares x 2 layers = 12 cubic units).
- When comparing the volumes of different 3D shapes, a student may incorrectly conclude that two shapes have the same volume because they have the same number of squares on one face, even if they have different depths or numbers of layers."
2087,Multiplies before applying a power ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly follow the order of operations (BIDMAS/BODMAS) and perform multiplication before applying an exponent or power to a number or expression. This can lead to incorrect calculations and solutions. The misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the correct order of operations or a tendency to perform operations from left to right, rather than following the established order.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: Evaluating expressions like 2 × 3^2, where the student multiplies 2 and 3 before squaring the result, rather than squaring 3 first.
- Case 2: Simplifying algebraic expressions like 2x × x^2, where the student multiplies 2x and x before squaring x, rather than squaring x first.
- Case 3: Solving problems involving exponents and multiplication in physics or engineering, such as calculating the area of a rectangle with a length of 3^2 cm and a width of 4 cm, where the student multiplies 3 and 4 before squaring 3.
- Case 4: Evaluating numerical expressions like 4 × 2^3, where the student multiplies 4 and 2 before cubing 2, rather than cubing 2 first."
2088,"When multiplying variables, thinks they add coefficients as well as powers","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the rules of multiplying variables with coefficients and powers. They incorrectly assume that when multiplying two variables, they need to add both the coefficients (numbers in front of the variables) and the powers (exponents) of the variables. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when dealing with expressions involving multiple variables and constants.

For example, when multiplying 2x^2 and 3x^3, a student with this misconception may think the result is (2+3)x^(2+3) = 5x^5, instead of applying the correct rules of multiplication. This misconception can be seen in various cases, such as:

- Multiplying monomials: 4x^2 * 2x^3
- Multiplying binomials: (2x^2 + 1) * (3x^3 + 2)
- Simplifying algebraic expressions: (2x^2 * 3x^3) / (2x^2)

In each of these cases, the student may incorrectly add the coefficients and powers, leading to wrong answers."
2089,"When asked to find a scale factor, assumes direction of enlargement does not matter","Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the scale factor is the same regardless of whether an object is enlarged or reduced in size. They may think that the scale factor is simply the ratio of the sizes of the two objects, without considering the direction of the enlargement. This means that they might calculate the scale factor as the ratio of the new size to the original size, without considering whether the object is being made larger or smaller.

For example, if a shape is enlarged by a factor of 2, a student with this misconception might think that the scale factor is the same if the shape is reduced to half its size. They might say that the scale factor is 2 in both cases, without realizing that the direction of the enlargement (or reduction) affects the scale factor.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When a student is asked to find the scale factor of an enlargement and they simply divide the new size by the original size, without considering whether the object is being enlarged or reduced.
* When a student is given a diagram of a shape that has been enlarged or reduced and they are asked to find the scale factor, but they ignore the direction of the enlargement.
* When a student is solving a problem that involves finding the scale factor of a series of enlargements or reductions, and they fail to consider the direction of each enlargement or reduction."
2090,Finds the area of the whole grid instead of the shaded shape,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a shaded shape within a grid, but instead of focusing on the shaded area, they calculate the area of the entire grid. This could be due to a lack of understanding of what is being asked or an inability to isolate the shaded shape from the rest of the grid.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

- A student is given a 5x5 grid with a shaded triangle inside and is asked to find the area of the triangle. Instead, they calculate the area of the entire 5x5 grid (25 square units).
- A student is provided with a grid containing a shaded rectangle and is asked to find the area of the rectangle. However, they find the area of the entire grid, including the unshaded regions.
- A student is asked to find the area of a shaded circle within a square grid, but they calculate the area of the square instead of focusing on the circle.
- A student is given a grid with multiple shaded shapes and is asked to find the total shaded area. Instead, they calculate the area of the entire grid, including the unshaded regions between the shapes."
2091,Thinks depth always goes front to back in a diagram of a 3D shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students assume that in any 3D shape diagram, the depth is always represented from the front to the back. They tend to think that the front of the shape is always the side closest to them, and the depth is measured from this front side towards the back. This misconception can be due to the way 3D shapes are often represented in 2D diagrams, which can create a false impression that depth always follows this front-to-back orientation.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to identify or measure the depth of a 3D shape, such as a cuboid or a prism, and they automatically assume the depth is from the front face to the back face, without considering the orientation of the shape.
- When students are given a 2D diagram of a 3D shape and are asked to describe its dimensions, and they incorrectly identify the depth due to their preconceived notion of front-to-back orientation.
- When students are building or drawing 3D shapes and consistently position the depth from front to back, even if it's not the correct orientation for the specific shape."
2092,Error finding percentage value after finding 1%,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students correctly find 1% of a number but then incorrectly calculate the required percentage value. They may find 1% by dividing the number by 100, but then incorrectly multiply the result by the percentage value, forgetting that the percentage value is already a multiple of 1%. For example, if asked to find 25% of 200, they might correctly calculate 1% as 200 ÷ 100 = 2, but then incorrectly multiply 2 by 25, resulting in 50, without realizing that 25% is actually 25 times 1%, which should be 2 x 25 = 2 x (25 x 1%) = 50, this is correct but their method may fail in some other scenario.

Some short cases where this misconception may occur:
1. Finding 15% of 300, where a student calculates 1% as 3 but then incorrectly calculates 15% as 3 x 15 = 45, this case is not incorrect but can be in other scenario.
2. Calculating a 12% discount on a £80 item, where a student finds 1% as £0.80 but then incorrectly finds 12% as £0.80 x 12 = £9.60, which is correct in this scenario.
3. Determining 8% of 450, where a student calculates 1% as 4.5 but then incorrectly calculates 8% as 4.5 x 8 = 36."
2093,Thinks the fraction bar means subtract rather than divide,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the fraction bar (the line separating the numerator and denominator in a fraction) as a subtraction symbol, rather than understanding it as a division operation. For example, they might read the fraction 3/4 as ""3 minus 4"" instead of ""3 divided by 4"". This can be due to the visual similarity between the fraction bar and the subtraction symbol (-), or a lack of understanding of the concept of fractions as a way of representing division.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying fractions: A student might simplify 5/2 as 5 - 2 = 3, instead of dividing 5 by 2.
- When comparing fractions: A student might compare 2/3 and 1/4 by subtracting the numerators and denominators separately, instead of comparing the values of the fractions as a whole.
- When adding or subtracting fractions: A student might add 1/4 and 1/6 by subtracting the denominators (4 - 6), instead of finding a common denominator and adding the numerators.
- When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions: A student might convert 2 3/4 to an improper fraction by subtracting 3 from 4, instead of multiplying the whole number part by the denominator and adding the numerator."
2094,Confuses all possible outcomes with options available,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number of possible outcomes in a probability scenario is equal to the number of options available. They fail to consider that some options may have multiple outcomes or that some outcomes may not be equally likely. For example, in a coin toss, students might think there are two options (heads or tails), but they might not consider that each option has only one possible outcome.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Rolling a die: Students might think there are 6 options (numbers 1-6), but they might not consider that each number has a different probability of being rolled (e.g., rolling a 1 is just as likely as rolling a 6).
- Drawing a card from a deck: Students might think there are 52 options (one for each card), but they might not consider that some cards have a higher probability of being drawn (e.g., drawing a red card is more likely than drawing a specific card like the Ace of Spades).
- Flipping a coin twice: Students might think there are 2 options (heads or tails), but they might not consider that there are actually 4 possible outcomes (HH, HT, TH, TT)."
2095,"When reading graph, chooses nearest marked value on axis instead of reading accurately","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are reading values from a graph, particularly when the value falls between two marked points on the axis. Instead of accurately estimating or calculating the value based on the scale, they tend to choose the nearest marked value, which can lead to inaccuracies. This might be due to a lack of understanding of how to read between the lines or interpolate values, or simply because it seems like an easier option.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a line graph shows a point halfway between the marked values of 10 and 20 on the y-axis, and the student records the value as either 10 or 20 instead of estimating it as 15.
- When a bar graph has a bar that ends between the marked values of 5 and 10 on the x-axis, and the student assumes the value is either 5 or 10 instead of accurately reading it as, for example, 7.5.
- When a scatter plot shows a point at a position that doesn't align exactly with the marked values on either axis, and the student rounds it to the nearest marked value instead of trying to estimate the actual value."
2096,When adding negatives believes that they can just add their absolute values and add a negative sign to the answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to adding negative numbers, but they struggle to understand the concept of adding numbers with different signs. They might believe that adding two negative numbers is the same as adding their absolute values and then attaching a negative sign to the result. For example, when adding -3 and -5, students with this misconception would think that the answer is -8 because they added the absolute values of 3 and 5 (which is 8) and then added a negative sign to the result.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When adding two negative integers, e.g., -2 + (-4)
- When adding a negative integer to a negative decimal, e.g., -2.5 + (-3.7)
- When solving word problems involving temperatures, e.g., ""If the temperature dropped by 5°C and then dropped by another 3°C, what is the total change in temperature?""
- When simplifying algebraic expressions involving negative numbers, e.g., -2x + (-3x)"
2097,Confuses prime factors and factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to differentiate between the prime factors of a number and its general factors. Factors are the numbers that can be multiplied together to get a specific number, whereas prime factors are the prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number. Students with this misconception may list all factors of a number when asked to find prime factors, or vice versa. They may also incorrectly identify composite numbers as prime numbers.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- When finding the prime factorization of a number, students may include composite numbers in the factorization.
- When asked to list all the factors of a number, students may only list the prime factors.
- When identifying prime numbers, students may incorrectly include composite numbers that have more than two factors.
- When simplifying fractions, students may incorrectly cancel out non-prime factors.
- When solving problems involving least common multiples (LCM) and greatest common divisors (GCD), students may get incorrect answers due to the confusion between prime factors and general factors."
2098,Multiplies all terms together when simplifying an expression,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of simplifying expressions in algebra. When faced with an expression containing multiple terms, they may incorrectly assume that all terms should be multiplied together to simplify it. This shows a lack of understanding of the rules of algebra, specifically the distinction between addition/subtraction and multiplication operations. Students with this misconception may overlook the need to apply the distributive property or combine like terms.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions like 2x + 3x, where students might multiply 2x and 3x instead of adding them.
- Expanding expressions like (2x + 3)(4x + 5), where students might multiply all terms together without applying the distributive property.
- Simplifying expressions like x + 2 + 3x, where students might multiply x, 2, and 3x instead of combining the x terms.
- Simplifying expressions like (x + 2)(x + 3), where students might multiply all terms together without applying the distributive property."
2099,Believes negative powers in standard form have the same impact as positive powers ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to grasp the fundamental concept of negative powers in the context of standard form (also known as scientific notation). They might think that a negative power has the same effect as a positive power, possibly due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the power and the base number.

For instance, students with this misconception may believe that 10^-3 is equivalent to 10^3 or that it represents a larger quantity, when in fact, it represents a much smaller quantity.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions with negative powers, such as 10^-2, and mistakenly thinking it is equal to 10^2.
- Converting between standard form and ordinary numbers, for example, thinking that 10^-4 is equal to 10,000 instead of 0.0001.
- Comparing numbers in standard form with negative powers, such as comparing 5 x 10^-3 with 5 x 10^3, and incorrectly assuming they are equal or that 5 x 10^-3 is larger.
- Solving mathematical problems involving negative powers, like calculating the value of 2 x 10^-2, and mistakenly arriving at an answer that is equivalent to 2 x 10^2."
2100,Divides rather than multiplies when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly interpret word problems that involve scaling or proportional relationships. They mistakenly divide instead of multiply, or vice versa, often due to a lack of understanding of the problem's context or the mathematical operation required to solve it. This misconception can be caused by misreading the problem, misunderstanding the relationship between the quantities involved, or relying on memorization rather than comprehension.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils. How many pencils does Tom have in total? (Student may divide 4 by 3 instead of multiplying 4 by 3)
- A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. How many books can the bookshelf hold in total? (Student may divide 8 by 5 instead of multiplying 8 by 5)
- A recipe requires 2 cups of flour to make 8 cookies. How many cups of flour are needed to make 16 cookies? (Student may divide 2 by 2 instead of multiplying 2 by 2)"
2101,Believes we move down a number line when we add,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a reversed understanding of the concept of addition on a number line. They mistakenly believe that adding a number means moving to the left or downwards on the number line, rather than moving to the right or upwards. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of addition as an increase or accumulation, or from a misunderstanding of the visual representation of a number line.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is asked to add 3 to 5 on a number line and moves 3 units to the left of 5, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2.
* When solving a simple addition problem like 2 + 4, the student counts down 4 units from 2 instead of counting up, giving an incorrect answer of -2.
* Given a word problem like ""Tom has 8 pencils and his friend gives him 2 more"", the student moves 2 units down from 8 on the number line, resulting in an incorrect answer of 6 pencils."
2102,Believes adjacent sides of a rhombus are always perpendicular,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the properties of a square to a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length, but it does not necessarily have right angles (90-degree angles) between its adjacent sides. However, students may incorrectly assume that because a square (a special type of rhombus with right angles) has perpendicular adjacent sides, all rhombi must also have perpendicular adjacent sides.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly conclude that the internal angles of a rhombus are always 90 degrees and that its diagonals are always equal in length, which is not necessarily the case.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- When asked to draw a rhombus, students may consistently draw a square, believing that a rhombus must have perpendicular sides.
- When solving problems involving the internal angles of a rhombus, students may assume that all internal angles are 90 degrees, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When identifying shapes in real-world objects, students may incorrectly classify a rhombus as a square due to their misconception about its side relationships.
- When asked to find the perimeter of a rhombus, students may assume that the diagonals are equal and perpendicular, which can lead to incorrect calculations.
- When working with geometric transformations, such as rotations and reflections, students may assume that a rhombus will always map to a square or another rhombus with perpendicular sides."
2103,Believes h in the formula for area of a trapezium stands for half the sum of the parallel sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misinterpret the formula for the area of a trapezium, which is A = (1/2)h(a + b) or A = h/2(a + b) or A = 0.5h(a + b), where 'a' and 'b' are the lengths of the parallel sides, and 'h' is the height or the distance between the parallel sides. The misconception occurs when students mistakenly think that 'h' represents half the sum of the parallel sides (i.e., h = (a + b)/2) instead of the height, which is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to find the area of a trapezium and they incorrectly use the sum of the parallel sides divided by 2 as the value of 'h'.
- When students are given the formula A = h/2(a + b) and incorrectly assume that the 'h' is already the sum of the parallel sides divided by 2.
- When students are given a trapezium with parallel sides of different lengths and are asked to calculate its area, and they use the incorrect interpretation of 'h' as half the sum of the parallel sides."
2104,Thinks that only the angles need to be the same for a polygon to be regular,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that as long as the angles of a polygon are equal, it is a regular polygon. They overlook the fact that a regular polygon also requires all its sides to be of equal length. As a result, they may incorrectly identify polygons with equal angles but unequal sides as regular polygons.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two polygons with the same number of sides and equal angles, but different side lengths. For example, comparing a square (regular quadrilateral) with a rectangle (non-regular quadrilateral) that has the same angles (90 degrees) but different side lengths.
- When attempting to draw or construct a regular polygon, focusing only on making the angles equal without considering the side lengths.
- When identifying and classifying different types of polygons, such as mistakenly labeling an isosceles triangle (with two equal sides and angles) as an equilateral triangle (a regular triangle with all sides and angles equal)."
2105,Has used slant height and base to find area rather than perpendicular height and base,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of triangles or other shapes and mistakenly use the slant height instead of the perpendicular height. The slant height is the distance from the base to the opposite vertex of the triangle, whereas the perpendicular height is the distance from the base to the opposite vertex measured at a right angle to the base. Students with this misconception may not understand the importance of using the perpendicular height when calculating area, leading to incorrect calculations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a triangle, where students may use the length of the slant side instead of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex to the base.
- When calculating the area of a parallelogram or trapezoid, where students may use the length of the slant side instead of finding the perpendicular height.
- When solving real-world problems, such as finding the area of a roof or the area of a piece of land, where using the slant height instead of the perpendicular height can lead to incorrect calculations.
- When working with 3D shapes, such as pyramids or cones, where students may need to find the surface area and mistakenly use the slant height instead of the perpendicular height."
2106,"When asked to find an angle given in three letter convention, thinks the angle you want to find will be located at the vertex labelled with the last letter","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the notation used to represent angles in geometry. In the three-letter convention, an angle is typically represented by three letters, with the middle letter denoting the vertex of the angle. However, students with this misconception mistakenly believe that the angle is located at the vertex labelled with the last letter, rather than the middle letter.

For example, if the angle is given as ""ABC"", students with this misconception would think that the angle is located at point C, rather than at point B. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect identification of angles in various geometric shapes and configurations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* When asked to identify the angle ""PQR"" in a triangle, a student may incorrectly point to the vertex labelled R, instead of Q.
* In a diagram with multiple angles labelled using the three-letter convention, a student may mistakenly identify the angle ""DEF"" as being located at point F, rather than at point E.
* When working with angles in a quadrilateral, a student may incorrectly identify the angle ""JKLM"" as being located at point M, rather than at point L."
2107,"Student thinks that negative decimals behave the same as positive decimals when positioning a decimal between two consecutive negative integers, placing the decimal with a greater absolute value to the right. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students extend their understanding of positive decimals to negative decimals without considering the direction and magnitude of negative numbers. In the case of positive decimals, a decimal with a greater value is placed to the right of a decimal with a smaller value between two consecutive integers. However, when dealing with negative decimals, students with this misconception will apply the same logic, incorrectly assuming that a negative decimal with a greater absolute value (i.e., a more negative value) should be placed to the right of a negative decimal with a smaller absolute value between two consecutive negative integers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing -3.5 and -3.2, the student might place -3.5 to the right of -3.2 between -3 and -4.
- When ordering -2.8, -2.5, and -2.9 from left to right between -2 and -3, the student might incorrectly place -2.9 to the right of -2.8 and -2.5.
- When determining the position of -1.9 and -1.7 between -1 and -2, the student might incorrectly place -1.9 to the right of -1.7."
2108,"Believes if a circle is divided into n equal sectors, the angles at the centre will each be n degrees","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the number of sectors a circle is divided into and the measure of the angles at the center of the circle. They mistakenly believe that if a circle is divided into n equal sectors, each sector's central angle will be n degrees. This error likely stems from a misunderstanding of the concept of angles and the properties of circles. Students may be confusing the number of sectors with the actual measure of the central angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to find the measure of each central angle in a circle divided into 5 equal sectors, a student might respond with 5 degrees.
* If a circle is divided into 10 equal sectors, a student with this misconception might claim that each central angle measures 10 degrees.
* When solving a problem involving a circle divided into 8 equal sectors, a student may incorrectly calculate the measure of each central angle as 8 degrees."
2109,Counts on in the wrong direction on a number line,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly move in the opposite direction on a number line, often due to a misunderstanding of the concept of counting on or counting back. When given a starting point on a number line and asked to count on by a certain number, some students may mistakenly move to the left (if counting on) or to the right (if counting back). This misconception reveals a lack of understanding of the relationship between numbers on a number line and the concept of counting.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the number that is 5 more than 10 on a number line, a student might start at 10 and count back 5 units instead of counting on, landing on 5 instead of 15.
- If a student is asked to count back 3 numbers from 8 on a number line, they may incorrectly move 3 units to the right, ending up at 11 instead of 5.
- Given a word problem, such as ""Tom has 15 pencils and gets 4 more,"" a student with this misconception may start at 15 on a number line and count back 4 units instead of counting on, resulting in an incorrect answer of 11 pencils instead of 19."
2110,Identifies a common multiple of two numbers when asked to consider a common multiple of three numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the least common multiple (LCM) of three numbers, but instead, they only consider the common multiples of two of the numbers, ignoring the third number. This can happen when students are not fully understanding the concept of LCM and its application to multiple numbers. They might be able to find the LCM of two numbers, but struggle to extend this to three or more numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to find the LCM of 4, 6, and 8, a student might find the LCM of 4 and 6 (which is 12) and assume that is the LCM of all three numbers, ignoring the fact that 8 is not a factor of 12.
* When given the numbers 3, 5, and 9, a student might find the LCM of 3 and 9 (which is 9), but fail to consider the factor of 5, which would result in a different LCM.
* When working with real-world problems, such as scheduling events that need to occur at regular intervals, students might only consider the intervals of two events, rather than all three, leading to incorrect conclusions."
2111,"Believes you do not include an ""other"" category when finding a total frequency","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with categorical data and are asked to calculate the total frequency. They may believe that the ""other"" category is not part of the data set and therefore, should not be included when adding up the frequencies of the different categories. This misunderstanding can lead to an incorrect total frequency, as the ""other"" category is indeed part of the data set and should be included in the calculation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A survey of favorite colors is conducted, and some students respond with colors not listed in the options. The student may think that these ""other"" colors are not part of the data set.
- A class votes on their favorite type of music, and some students choose genres that are not listed. The student may exclude these ""other"" genres when calculating the total frequency.
- A store collects data on the types of payment methods used by customers, and some customers use methods not listed, such as cryptocurrency. The student may not include these ""other"" payment methods when finding the total frequency."
2112,Does not understand how to find percentages of an amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the concept of percentages as a proportion of a whole, leading to difficulties in calculating percentages of a given amount. They may misunderstand that finding a percentage of an amount involves multiplying the amount by the percentage value, which is actually a decimal. Students might mistakenly add or subtract the percentage value from the amount instead of applying the correct multiplication process.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of £80. A student might subtract 15 from 80 instead of calculating 15% of 80 and subtracting the result from 80.
- Case 2: A bakery is offering a 20% discount on a £50 cake. A student may think that the discount is £20, rather than calculating 20% of 50 and subtracting the result from 50.
- Case 3: A student is asked to find 25% of 120 and might add 25 to 120 instead of multiplying 120 by 0.25."
2113,Confuses the equations of vertical and horizontal lines,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the equations of vertical and horizontal lines. They may incorrectly recall or apply the formulas, often swapping the forms of the equations. A vertical line has an equation of the form x = a, where 'a' is a constant, representing a line that extends infinitely along the y-axis at a fixed x-coordinate. On the other hand, a horizontal line has an equation of the form y = b, where 'b' is a constant, representing a line that extends infinitely along the x-axis at a fixed y-coordinate.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify or graph lines, which can cause problems in various mathematical contexts, such as graphing, solving systems of equations, and understanding linear relationships.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Graphing: When asked to graph a vertical line with equation x = 2, a student may incorrectly draw a horizontal line at y = 2.
2. Solving equations: When solving a system of equations, a student may confuse the equation of a vertical line (x = a) with that of a horizontal line (y = b), leading to incorrect solutions.
3. Linear relationships: When analyzing linear relationships, students may misinterpret the equation of a vertical or horizontal line, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between variables."
2114,"When completing the square, believes a coefficient of x^2 does not affect the value of the constant inside the bracket","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to complete the square in quadratic expressions. They may incorrectly assume that the coefficient of the x^2 term does not impact the constant term inside the bracket when completing the square. As a result, they may incorrectly apply the formula for completing the square, leading to errors in their calculations.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* When completing the square for a quadratic expression like 2x^2 + 6x + 3, students may incorrectly think that the constant term inside the bracket will be the same as it would be if the coefficient of x^2 were 1.
* When comparing two quadratic expressions, such as x^2 + 4x + 4 and 2x^2 + 8x + 4, students may not realize that the constant term inside the bracket will be different due to the coefficient of x^2.
* When solving quadratic equations by completing the square, students may overlook the effect of the coefficient of x^2 on the constant term, leading to incorrect solutions."
2115,Believes any of the angles can be used in the trigonometric formula for area of a triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the formula for the area of a triangle using trigonometry, which is Area = (1/2)ab sin(C), where a and b are the lengths of two sides of the triangle, and C is the angle between them. Some students may incorrectly assume that any angle of the triangle can be used in the formula, rather than specifically the angle between the two sides being multiplied (sides a and b in the formula). They may think that as long as they have any angle, the formula will give the correct area.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Finding the area of a triangle with angles 30°, 60°, and 90°. A student may mistakenly use the 90° angle in the formula, rather than the angle between the two sides they are multiplying.
- Solving a problem involving a right-angled triangle with angles 45°, 45°, and 90°. The student may incorrectly use one of the 45° angles in the formula without considering the sides being multiplied.
- Calculating the area of a triangle in a real-world problem, such as finding the area of a triangular garden bed with angles 60°, 60°, and 60°. The student may mistakenly use any of the angles without identifying the correct angle between the two sides."
2116,Does not round up when an answer is non-sensical in a real-life context,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students rigidly apply rounding rules without considering the context of the problem, leading to nonsensical or unrealistic answers. They may round down or follow the standard rounding rules (e.g., rounding 0.5 up or down) even when it doesn't make sense in real-life situations. This misconception highlights the importance of contextual understanding and critical thinking in mathematical problem-solving.

Example cases where this misconception may occur:

- A water tank can hold 5.99 gallons of water. If a student calculates the capacity and rounds down to 5 gallons, they might conclude that the tank cannot hold 5.99 gallons, even though it is the actual capacity.
- A bakery is packaging 3.7 kilograms of flour into bags. If a student rounds down to 3 kilograms, they might assume that the remaining 0.7 kilograms of flour does not exist or is not needed, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the situation.
- A car travels 4.98 miles in 10 minutes. If a student rounds down to 4 miles, they might conclude that the car travels only 4 miles in that time, which is not accurate."
2117,Thinks that all angles anywhere along a straight line add to 180,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of angles on a straight line. They believe that any combination of angles along a straight line will always add up to 180 degrees, regardless of their position or relationship to each other. This misconception fails to consider that the angles must be adjacent and share a common vertex, or meet at a single point, for the sum of their measures to be 180 degrees.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the measure of an angle that is not adjacent to another angle on the same line.
- When dealing with multiple angles along a straight line, but not all of them meet at a single point.
- When trying to apply the concept of angles on a straight line to angles that are not coplanar (i.e., not lying in the same plane).
- When attempting to find the sum of angles formed by intersecting lines or transversals.
- When solving problems involving angles in complex diagrams or real-world applications, where angles may not always be adjacent or on the same line."
2118,Struggles to visualise elevations of 3D shapes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty in picturing and understanding the 2D representations of 3D objects, specifically the elevations. Elevations are the 2D views of a 3D object from the side, front, or top. Students may struggle to visualize how the different sides and features of the 3D object relate to each other and how they would appear in a 2D representation.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to draw the elevation of a complex 3D shape, like a building or a pyramid, and they fail to accurately represent the relationships between the different sides and features.
- When students are given a 2D elevation of a 3D shape and are asked to identify the different parts of the shape, but they struggle to understand how the 2D representation relates to the 3D object.
- When students are asked to create a 3D model from a set of 2D elevations, but they find it difficult to visualize how the different elevations fit together to form the 3D shape.
- When students are given a real-world problem, such as designing a building or a bridge, and they need to create elevations as part of the design process, but they struggle to visualize how the different components of the structure relate to each other in 3D space."
2119,Ignores the negative sign,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students overlook or disregard the negative sign in front of a number, often treating it as if it were positive. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of negative numbers or simply a careless mistake. As a result, students may perform calculations or comparisons incorrectly, leading to wrong answers.

This misconception can manifest in various areas of mathematics, including:

- Number: When adding or subtracting negative numbers, students may ignore the negative sign and perform the operation as if the numbers were positive. For example, when calculating -3 + 2, they might treat it as 3 + 2.

- Algebra: Students may disregard the negative sign when working with algebraic expressions or equations, such as -2x + 3 = 5, and solve it as if the equation were 2x + 3 = 5.

- Data and Statistics: When working with data that includes negative numbers, students might ignore the negative sign and incorrectly calculate averages, ranges, or other statistical measures.

- Geometry and Measure: Although less common, this misconception can also appear in geometry and measurement problems, such as when working with coordinates or temperatures. For instance, students might mistakenly treat a negative temperature as if it were positive.

Some short cases where this misconception may occur include:

- Case 1: Simplifying the expression -2 + 5, a student might ignore the negative sign and write the answer as 7 instead of 3.

- Case 2: Solving the equation -x + 2 = 3, a student might disregard the negative sign and solve for x as if the equation were x + 2 = 3.

- Case 3: Calculating the average of a set of numbers that includes negative values, a student might ignore the negative signs and obtain an incorrect average.

- Case 4: When working with coordinates, a student might mistakenly plot a point with a negative coordinate as if it were positive, leading to incorrect graphing or analysis."
2120,Believes they do not have to say the point when reading a decimal aloud,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are reading decimal numbers aloud. They may simply read the digits before and after the decimal point without mentioning the word ""point"" to indicate the decimal. For example, when reading the number 5.8, a student with this misconception might say ""five eight"" instead of ""five point eight"". This misconception can lead to confusion, especially when dealing with more complex decimal numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading decimal measurements, such as the height of a person (e.g., 1.75 meters) as ""one seven five"" instead of ""one point seven five meters"".
- When saying decimal numbers in math problems, such as 4.2 + 2.1, a student might say ""four two plus two one"" instead of ""four point two plus two point one"".
- When reading decimal values from a chart or graph, a student might omit the word ""point"" when stating the value, leading to confusion about the actual value."
2121,Believes angles on a straight line add to 100 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand or misremember the fundamental property of angles on a straight line. They may have been taught or have seen examples where the sum of angles on a straight line is discussed, but the actual value of 180 degrees is either miscommunicated, misinterpreted, or not fully understood. As a result, the students mistakenly believe that the sum of the angles on a straight line is 100 degrees instead of the correct 180 degrees.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When drawing or measuring angles on a straight line, students might calculate or expect the total to be 100 degrees.
- In problem-solving, students may set up equations with the incorrect assumption that angles on a straight line sum to 100 degrees, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When dealing with more complex geometric shapes, such as triangles or polygons, students may apply this misconception, causing errors in their calculations and conclusions.
- In real-world applications, such as design, architecture, or engineering, this misconception could lead to inaccurate measurements and designs that do not meet the required specifications."
2122,Thinks two letters next to each other is a division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret two letters or variables placed side by side as a division operation, rather than understanding it as multiplication. In algebra, when two variables are written next to each other without an explicit operation, it implies multiplication, not division. For example, 'ab' is often mistakenly thought to mean 'a ÷ b' instead of the correct interpretation, which is 'a × b'.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions like 2ab, where students might incorrectly simplify it to 2 ÷ (a ÷ b).
- When solving equations like ab = 12, where students might mistakenly rewrite it as a ÷ b = 12.
- When working with formulas like the area of a rectangle (A = lw), where students might incorrectly interpret 'lw' as length divided by width, instead of length multiplied by width."
2123,Divided by 100 rather than 10,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to convert a percentage to a decimal or divide by a multiple of 10, such as converting a percentage to a decimal or dividing by 10, 100, or 1000. Students may mistakenly assume that they need to divide by 100 in all cases involving moving the decimal point, resulting in an incorrect answer.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Converting percentages to decimals: Students may divide by 100 when converting a percentage to a decimal, even if the percentage is already in its decimal form.
- Dividing decimals by multiples of 10: When dividing decimals by 10 or 1000, students may mistakenly divide by 100 instead, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- Converting units of measurement: Students may also make this mistake when converting between units of measurement, such as converting millimeters to meters or grams to kilograms.
- Calculating discounts or interest rates: When calculating discounts or interest rates, students may incorrectly divide by 100, resulting in an incorrect calculation of the discount or interest.
- Converting between fractions and decimals: This misconception may also arise when converting fractions to decimals, where students may mistakenly divide by 100 instead of the correct denominator."
2124,Cannot identify a fraction on a number line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to visualize and understand the concept of fractions as part of a whole on a number line. They may have difficulty identifying the position of a fraction, such as 1/2 or 3/4, on a number line, often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the fraction and the whole, or the concept of equivalence between fractions. This can lead to difficulties in comparing and ordering fractions, as well as performing arithmetic operations involving fractions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify the position of a fraction on a number line, they may point to the numerator (e.g., 1 in 1/2) rather than the actual position of the fraction.
- When comparing fractions, students may incorrectly assume that a fraction with a larger numerator is greater than one with a smaller numerator, without considering the denominator.
- When ordering fractions on a number line, students may have difficulty placing equivalent fractions (e.g., 1/2 and 2/4) in the correct position.
- When solving problems involving fractions, such as adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, students may become confused and make errors due to their lack of understanding of fractions on a number line."
2125,"When multiplying a multiple of 10, just multiplies the non-zero digits","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying numbers that involve multiples of 10. They tend to ignore the zeros at the end of the multiple of 10 and only multiply the non-zero digits, forgetting to add the zeros to the result afterwards. For example, when multiplying 4 x 10, they might just multiply 4 x 1 and forget to add the zero at the end.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- 3 x 20: Students might just multiply 3 x 2, resulting in 6, instead of 60.
- 5 x 100: Students might just multiply 5 x 1, resulting in 5, instead of 500.
- 2 x 50: Students might just multiply 2 x 5, resulting in 10, instead of 100.
- 10 x 30: Students might just multiply 1 x 3, resulting in 3, instead of 300.

This misconception can lead to incorrect results and a lack of understanding of the concept of place value and the effect of multiplying by multiples of 10."
2126,Miscounts when subtracting over zero,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to perform subtraction problems that involve crossing zero or regrouping from one place value to another. Students may struggle with the concept of regrouping or borrowing from the next place value, especially when the minuend (the number being subtracted from) has a zero in the ones place. As a result, they may miscount the number of units being subtracted, leading to an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* 104 - 27 = ? (students may struggle with regrouping from the tens place to the ones place)
* 50 - 32 = ? (students may miscount the number of units being subtracted when crossing zero)
* 150 - 97 = ? (students may have difficulty regrouping from the hundreds place to the tens place)
* 25 - 19 = ? (students may miscount the number of units being subtracted when regrouping from the tens place to the ones place)
* 73 - 47 = ? (students may struggle with regrouping from the tens place to the ones place)"
2127,Thinks the gradient of a line includes the variable x,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of gradient in linear equations. They might confuse the gradient, often represented by the variable 'm' in the slope-intercept form of a line (y = mx + c), with the variable 'x' which represents the x-coordinate on the coordinate plane. Students might think that the gradient is an expression that includes the variable 'x', rather than a constant value that represents the rate of change of the line.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the equation of a line and students write the gradient as 'x' or an expression containing 'x' instead of a numerical value.
- When interpreting the gradient in a real-world context, such as the steepness of a ramp or the rate of change of a quantity, and students think the gradient changes depending on the x-coordinate.
- When graphing lines and students attempt to plot points using a variable gradient that includes 'x', resulting in an incorrect graph.
- When solving problems involving parallel or perpendicular lines and students incorrectly apply the concept of gradient, thinking it is related to the x-coordinate."
2128,Believes a common denominator must always be the two denominators multiplied together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to adding and subtracting fractions with different denominators. They may mistakenly believe that the only way to find a common denominator is by multiplying the two denominators together. This can lead to unnecessary calculations and overly complicated fractions.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When adding 1/4 and 1/6, a student with this misconception may think the common denominator must be 24 (4 x 6) instead of finding the least common multiple, which is 12.
- When subtracting 2/8 from 3/10, a student may believe the common denominator must be 80 (8 x 10) instead of finding the least common multiple, which is 40.
- When comparing the sizes of 3/8 and 2/6, a student may think they need to convert both fractions to have a denominator of 48 (8 x 6) instead of finding the least common multiple, which is 24."
2129,Increases by the given percentage rather than finding the percentage of an amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a percentage of a quantity, but instead of calculating the percentage as a proportion of the original amount, they simply add the percentage to the original amount. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of percentages as a proportion of a whole. 

For example, if a shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of £100, a student with this misconception may think the discount is £15 added to the original price, resulting in a new price of £115. Similarly, if a savings account earns a 5% interest on a deposit of £500, a student may think the interest is £5 added to the original deposit, rather than calculating 5% of £500.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A book's price increases by 8%. If the book originally costs £25, a student may think the new price is £25 + 8 = £33.
- A bakery is having a 20% off sale on all bread. If a loaf of bread originally costs £2.50, a student may think the discount is £2.50 + 20 = £2.70.
- A person invests £1000 in a stock that earns a 10% dividend. A student may think the dividend is £1000 + 10 = £1010."
2130,"Does not know the meaning of the word ""sum""","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the mathematical term ""sum"" and its meaning. In mathematics, the word ""sum"" refers to the result of adding two or more numbers together. Students with this misconception may interpret ""sum"" as a general term or confuse it with other mathematical operations. They may not understand that it specifically represents the outcome of an addition process.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When a teacher asks students to find the sum of 2 + 2, and they respond with an answer that is not related to addition.
- When students are given a word problem that involves finding the sum of a set of numbers, but they fail to recognize the need to add the numbers together.
- When students are working with number sequences or patterns and are asked to find the sum of a series of numbers, but they do not understand what operation to perform.
- When students are solving algebraic equations and need to find the sum of variables or constants, but they are unsure of how to proceed."
2131,"When multiplying out 2 or more brackets, does not multiply all the combinations of terms","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with the expansion of expressions involving two or more brackets, such as (x + 3)(x + 4) or (2x - 1)(x + 2). In such cases, students may incorrectly assume that they only need to multiply the terms in corresponding positions within the brackets, or they might miss out on multiplying certain combinations of terms. For instance, they might only multiply the first terms in each bracket and the last terms, but forget to multiply the first term in the first bracket by the last term in the second bracket, and vice versa.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Expanding expressions with two brackets: (x + 3)(x + 4), (2x - 1)(x + 2)
- Expanding expressions with more than two brackets: (x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 1), (x - 1)(2x + 3)(x - 4)
- Expanding expressions involving different variables: (x + 2y)(x - 3y), (a - b)(2a + 3b)
- Expanding expressions involving constants and variables: (x + 2)(3x - 4), (2x - 3)(x + 5)"
2132,Thinks there are 100m and a km,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the relationship between meters (m) and kilometers (km). They may mistakenly believe that there are 100 meters in a kilometer, rather than 1000 meters. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the metric system or a simple arithmetic error.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting distances from meters to kilometers or vice versa, students may miscalculate the conversion factor, leading to incorrect answers.
- When solving problems involving distances or speeds, students may use the incorrect conversion factor, resulting in incorrect calculations.
- In real-life situations, such as measuring the distance between two locations, students may incorrectly estimate the distance in kilometers or meters, leading to confusion or incorrect conclusions.
- In problems involving scale drawings or maps, students may misinterpret the scale, thinking that 1 kilometer is equal to 100 meters, rather than 1000 meters."
2133,"When dividing a decimal by a multiple of 10, just divides the fractional place values ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing decimals by multiples of 10. They may believe that they can simply divide or 'move' the decimal point without considering the actual division process. For example, when dividing 4.2 by 10, students with this misconception may think that they can simply 'move' the decimal point one place to the left to get 0.42. However, this approach is not based on a deep understanding of the division process, and it may lead to errors when dealing with more complex problems.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Dividing 12.4 by 100, where students may simply 'move' the decimal point two places to the left to get 0.124 without considering the actual division process.
- Dividing 3.45 by 10, where students may 'move' the decimal point one place to the left to get 0.345 without understanding the underlying division.
- Dividing 9.81 by 1000, where students may 'move' the decimal point three places to the left to get 0.00981 without considering the actual division process."
2134,when multiplying fractions multiplies by the reciprocal of the 2nd fraction instead,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying fractions. Instead of multiplying the numerators and denominators as they should, they mistakenly multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction. This would actually be the correct method for dividing fractions, not multiplying them. 

For example, if a student is asked to multiply 1/2 and 3/4, they might incorrectly multiply 1/2 by 4/3 (the reciprocal of 3/4) instead of multiplying the numerators (1*3) and denominators (2*4). 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Multiplying simple fractions: 1/2 * 2/3 (student might multiply 1/2 by 3/2 instead)
- Multiplying fractions with variables: 1/x * 2/3 (student might multiply 1/x by 3/2 instead)
- Word problems involving multiplication of fractions: ""A recipe requires 1/4 cup of sugar. If you want to make 3/4 of the recipe, how much sugar do you need?"" (student might mistakenly multiply 1/4 by 4/3 instead)"
2135,Thinks positive or negative sign affects the term before it,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a positive or negative sign only affects the term immediately preceding it, rather than understanding that the sign affects the entire expression or term that follows. They may incorrectly apply the sign to only the adjacent number or variable, rather than distributing it to the entire term.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying expressions, e.g., -3(2x + 5), where students might think the negative sign only affects the 3, rather than the entire expression inside the parentheses.
- When solving equations, e.g., 2x - 3 = -5, where students might think the negative sign only affects the 3, rather than the entire expression on the right side of the equation.
- When working with polynomials, e.g., -(x^2 + 2x - 1), where students might think the negative sign only affects the x^2 term, rather than the entire polynomial.
- When dealing with inequalities, e.g., -2x > 4, where students might think the negative sign only affects the 2, rather than the entire expression."
2136,"When finding the square root of a decimal, ignores place value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the square root of a decimal number. They tend to ignore the place value of the digits after the decimal point, treating the decimal as if it were a whole number. For instance, when finding the square root of 0.16, they might simply find the square root of 16 (which is 4) without considering the decimal place. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of how decimal places affect calculations involving square roots.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Finding the square root of 0.4. A student might find the square root of 4 (which is 2) and write the answer as 2, ignoring the decimal place.

- Case 2: Calculating the square root of 2.25. A student may find the square root of 225 and write the answer without considering the decimal place, showing a lack of understanding of place value in decimals.

- Case 3: Evaluating the square root of 0.09. The student may calculate the square root of 9 and provide an answer without accounting for the decimal place, demonstrating this misconception."
2137,Does not know what dashes on the sides of shapes mean,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or misunderstand the notation used to represent different types of lines and edges in geometric shapes. In particular, the dashes on the sides of shapes often indicate that the line is not a solid edge, but rather a hidden edge, an invisible line, or a line that is not part of the actual shape. Students with this misconception might interpret these dashed lines as actual edges, leading to confusion when calculating perimeter, surface area, or volume, or when identifying properties of the shape.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When determining the number of edges or faces of a 3D shape, students might include dashed lines as actual edges.
- When calculating the perimeter of a shape, students might include the lengths of dashed lines.
- When identifying the properties of a shape, such as whether it is a regular or irregular polygon, students might be confused by the presence of dashed lines.
- When visualizing and drawing 3D shapes from 2D representations, students might incorrectly include or exclude dashed lines, leading to inaccurate drawings."
2138,Does not understand a percentage can be applied to something not out of 100,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that percentages can only be applied to quantities that are out of 100. They may think that the term ""percent"" literally means ""out of 100"" and struggle to comprehend that percentages can be applied to any quantity, regardless of its size. For instance, they may find it difficult to calculate 25% of 50 or 10% of 200, as these quantities are not out of 100.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Calculating discounts or sales tax on items with prices that are not multiples of 100 (e.g., finding 15% of $27).
- Determining the percentage of students who scored above a certain grade in a class of 25 students.
- Finding the percentage increase or decrease in a quantity that is not out of 100 (e.g., a 20% increase in a salary of $60,000).
- Calculating interest on savings or investments with principal amounts that are not multiples of 100 (e.g., finding 5% interest on $450)."
2139,"When finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence, believes that the coefficient of n is half the second difference","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to derive the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence. A quadratic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is not constant, but the difference between the differences (the second difference) is constant. 

When finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence, students may mistakenly believe that the coefficient of n is half the second difference. This may be because they are confusing the process of finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence with that of an arithmetic sequence, or they may have misinterpreted the relationship between the second difference and the coefficient of n^2. 

This misconception can lead students to write an incorrect nth term rule, which can result in incorrect predictions for future terms in the sequence.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When the second difference is 4, the student may incorrectly write the nth term rule with a coefficient of n as 2.
* When the second difference is 6, the student may incorrectly write the nth term rule with a coefficient of n as 3.
* When the second difference is 10, the student may incorrectly write the nth term rule with a coefficient of n as 5."
2140,Believes division is carried out before a power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the order of operations, which is a set of rules that dictate the order in which mathematical operations should be performed when more than one operation is present in an expression. Students with this misconception believe that division operations should be carried out before exponentiation (powers), which can lead to incorrect calculations.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Evaluating expressions like 10 ÷ 2², where students might perform the division first and then the exponentiation.
- Simplifying algebraic expressions like 12x ÷ 3², where students might divide 12 by 3 before squaring the 3.
- Solving problems involving numerical calculations, such as 48 ÷ 2³, where students might divide 48 by 2 before cubing the 2.
- Interpreting mathematical formulas, such as those used in geometry or physics, where the order of operations is crucial to obtain accurate results."
2141,Believes that 'zero' is read as the letter 'O',"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the numerical value '0' (zero) with the alphabetical letter 'O'. They may think that '0' is pronounced the same way as the letter 'O', leading to incorrect reading and possibly writing of numbers. This misconception can be caused by the visual similarity between the two characters, especially in certain fonts or handwriting styles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading or writing numbers that contain zeros, such as 100 or 102.
- When differentiating between the letter 'O' and the number '0' in algebraic expressions, such as 2x + 0 versus 2x + O (where O is an alphabetical letter).
- When reading or interpreting data and statistics, such as reading ""0"" as ""O"" in a table or graph.
- When measuring quantities, such as reading 0.5 meters as ""O point 5 meters"".
- When solving mathematical problems that involve zeros, such as 10 - 0 = ? (reading the answer as ""ten minus O"" instead of ""ten minus zero"")."
2142,"Does not know that to factorise a quadratic expression, to find two numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term, and multiply to give the non variable term
","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to recognize the relationship between the coefficients of a quadratic expression in the form ax^2 + bx + c and the numbers required to factorise it. They may not understand that to factorise a quadratic expression, they need to find two numbers whose sum equals the coefficient of the x term (b) and whose product equals the constant term (c). This indicates a lack of understanding of the underlying algebraic structure of quadratic expressions and the factoring process.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising a simple quadratic expression, such as x^2 + 5x + 6, where the student may not be able to identify the correct numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term (5) and multiply to give the constant term (6).
- Factorising a quadratic expression with negative coefficients, such as x^2 - 7x + 12, where the student may struggle to find the correct numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term (-7) and multiply to give the constant term (12).
- Factorising a quadratic expression with a non-integer coefficient of x, such as x^2 + 2.5x + 1, where the student may find it challenging to identify the correct numbers that add to give the coefficient of the x term (2.5) and multiply to give the constant term (1)."
2143,Adds instead of multiplying when expanding bracket,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add the terms inside the brackets to the terms outside, instead of multiplying them. When expanding a bracket in an algebraic expression, students should apply the distributive property, which states that each term inside the bracket should be multiplied by each term outside the bracket. However, students with this misconception will incorrectly add the terms, leading to an incorrect expansion.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Expanding a simple bracket: 2(x + 3) might be incorrectly expanded as 2 + x + 3 instead of 2x + 6.
- Expanding a bracket with multiple terms: 3(x + 2y - 1) might be incorrectly expanded as 3 + x + 2y - 1 instead of 3x + 6y - 3.
- Expanding a bracket with negative terms: -(x - 2) might be incorrectly expanded as -x - 2 instead of -x + 2."
2144,Believes a number written in standard form cannot have a lot of decimal places,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to standard form, which is often initially presented with examples that have a single digit or a small number of digits after the decimal point. As a result, students may mistakenly believe that standard form is limited to numbers with few decimal places. They may struggle to understand that standard form can represent very large or very small numbers with many decimal places.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When asked to write a number like 4.236 x 10^5 in standard form, a student may express doubt or uncertainty about how to handle the multiple decimal places.
- When converting a number with many decimal places from standard form to ordinary form, a student may incorrectly round or truncate the number, losing precision.
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as scientific measurements or financial calculations, that involve numbers with many decimal places, students may incorrectly assume that standard form is not applicable or is too complicated to use."
2145,Believes an upward slope on a distance-time graph means travelling back towards the starting point.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misinterpret the meaning of the slope on a distance-time graph. They mistakenly believe that an upward slope indicates movement towards the starting point, rather than an increase in distance from the starting point. This misconception is often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between distance, time, and direction on a graph.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When analyzing a distance-time graph of an object moving away from a fixed point, students may think that the object is returning to the starting point when they see an upward slope.
- When comparing the distance-time graphs of two objects, one moving towards and one moving away from a fixed point, students may incorrectly identify which object is moving in which direction based on the slope of the graph.
- When describing the motion of an object based on a distance-time graph, students may incorrectly state that the object is moving back to the starting point when the graph shows an upward slope."
2146,Believes the line y = mx - c will cross the y axis at c,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the equation of a line in slope-intercept form, y = mx + c. They incorrectly believe that the line crosses the y-axis at the point (0, -c) instead of (0, c). This means they think the y-intercept is the negative of the constant term, rather than the constant term itself.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When graphing a line with a negative slope and a positive y-intercept, for example, y = -2x - 3, where the student would incorrectly think the line crosses the y-axis at (0, 3) instead of (0, -3).
- When solving systems of linear equations, where the student's incorrect understanding of the y-intercept could lead to incorrect solutions.
- When interpreting the meaning of the y-intercept in real-world contexts, such as the initial cost of a service, where the student's misconception could lead to incorrect conclusions."
2147,Believes they should multiply each numerator by its original denominator when adding/subtracting fractions,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. They mistakenly believe that to make the denominators the same, they need to multiply each numerator by its original denominator. This results in an incorrect calculation, as the students are essentially multiplying each fraction by its own denominator instead of finding a common denominator.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When adding fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 + 1/6.
- When subtracting fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/2 - 1/3.
- When solving mixed number problems, e.g., 2 1/4 + 1 1/6.
- When dealing with real-world problems involving fractions, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza among friends.
- When simplifying complex fractions or mixed numbers in algebraic expressions.
- When working with equivalent ratios or proportions in geometry and measurement problems."
2148,"When simplifying, thinks they write 0 in front of a negative number in the final answer, instead of just writing the negative number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying mathematical expressions that result in a negative number. They mistakenly believe that it's necessary to include a zero before the negative sign in the final answer. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that when working with numbers in real-life scenarios or when using calculators, a negative number is sometimes displayed with a zero before the negative sign (e.g., 0 - 5 = -05, but simplified as -5). However, in standard mathematical notation, a negative number is written without the leading zero.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Simplifying expressions with negative numbers: e.g., 2 - 7 = -5 (writing -05 or 0-5 instead of just -5)
- Solving linear equations: e.g., 2x + 3 = -4 (writing 0 - 7/2 instead of just -7/2)
- Calculating with negative temperatures: e.g., if the temperature drops by 5°C below zero, students might write 0 - 5°C instead of just -5°C
- Subtracting a larger number from a smaller number: e.g., 3 - 8 = -5 (writing 0 - 5 instead of just -5)"
2149,Converted seconds to minutes instead of seconds to hours,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are required to convert time from seconds to hours but mistakenly convert seconds to minutes first and then forget to complete the conversion process to hours, or simply convert seconds to minutes without considering the final step of conversion to hours. 

This misconception may arise due to students' overreliance on the conversion factor between seconds and minutes (i.e., 60 seconds = 1 minute), which is more commonly used in everyday life, and their lack of understanding or practice in converting between seconds and hours directly (i.e., 3600 seconds = 1 hour).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: If a question asks how many hours a 7200-second movie lasts, students with this misconception may convert 7200 seconds to 120 minutes and then stop there, instead of further converting it to hours (which would be 2 hours).

- Case 2: When solving a problem involving speeds or rates that require time conversions, students may incorrectly convert seconds to minutes and then use the incorrect time in their subsequent calculations, ultimately leading to an incorrect answer.

- Case 3: In a word problem, students are asked to calculate the time it takes to complete a task in hours, given the time taken in seconds. If they convert the time from seconds to minutes but fail to take the next step of converting minutes to hours, their answer will be incorrect."
2150,Does not know the 6 timestable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not familiar with or have not memorized the multiplication table of 6, which is a fundamental concept in mathematics. The 6 times table is a multiplication table that shows the result of multiplying 6 by various numbers. For example, 6 x 1 = 6, 6 x 2 = 12, 6 x 3 = 18, and so on.

This lack of knowledge can hinder students' ability to perform multiplication and division calculations involving the number 6, making it difficult for them to solve problems in various math topics, such as Number, Algebra, and Measure.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When multiplying 6 by a single-digit number (e.g., 6 x 4 = ?)
* When multiplying 6 by a multi-digit number (e.g., 6 x 24 = ?)
* When dividing a number by 6 (e.g., 36 ÷ 6 = ?)
* When solving real-world problems that involve multiplying or dividing by 6, such as calculating the cost of 6 items or measuring the area of a room that is 6 meters long.
* When solving word problems that involve the 6 times table, such as ""Tom has 6 groups of 4 pencils. How many pencils does Tom have in total?"""
2151,Thinks you cannot find the range if there are an even number of values,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that having an even number of values in a dataset prevents them from determining the range. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. Students with this misconception may think that an even number of values creates some sort of ambiguity or complication in identifying the highest and lowest values, and therefore, the range cannot be calculated.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When a student is given a dataset with an even number of exam scores (e.g., 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22) and is asked to find the range of the scores.
- When a student is collecting data on the heights of an even number of people (e.g., 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185) and needs to calculate the range of heights.
- When a student is analyzing the prices of an even number of items (e.g., $5, $7, $10, $12, $15, $20) and is asked to find the range of prices."
2152,Believes every number is the mode when you have data with no mode,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with a dataset where each value appears only once, resulting in no number appearing more frequently than any other. In such cases, some students may mistakenly believe that every number in the dataset is a mode, simply because no single value stands out as appearing more often than the others. They might think that since all numbers are ""tied"" in terms of frequency, they are all equally modes.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- A dataset containing the exam scores of a class where each student scored a different mark (e.g., 50, 55, 60, 65, etc.).
- A list of the number of siblings each student in the class has, with no number of siblings being repeated (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.).
- A collection of different heights of students in the class, with each height being unique (e.g., 150 cm, 155 cm, 160 cm, etc.).

In each of these cases, students may incorrectly conclude that every number in the dataset is a mode, since no single value appears more frequently than any other."
2153,Thinks the category with the most common bar height is the mode,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the mode of a dataset is the category with the tallest bar in a bar chart or histogram, rather than the category with the highest frequency or the most common value. They may focus solely on the visual representation of the data, assuming that the tallest bar corresponds to the mode, without considering the actual values or frequencies.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When analyzing a bar chart with varying bar widths, where the tallest bar may not necessarily represent the most common value.
- When dealing with a histogram with unequal class intervals, where the tallest bar may not correspond to the mode.
- When comparing multiple datasets with different scales, where the tallest bar may not represent the mode due to differences in scaling.
- When working with categorical data, where the mode is not necessarily the category with the most prominent bar in a bar chart.
- When interpreting graphs with multiple peaks or irregular distributions, where the mode may not be immediately apparent from the visual representation."
2154,Thinks finding a fraction of an amount means subtracting from that amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding a fraction of an amount. They mistakenly believe that finding a fraction of an amount means taking away or subtracting a certain portion from the original amount. This misunderstanding leads them to think that the fraction is being subtracted from the original amount, rather than being used as a multiplier to find a proportion of it.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a student is asked to find 1/4 of 12 and they respond with 12 - 4 = 8, instead of understanding that 1/4 is a multiplier.
- When a student is asked to find 3/4 of 16 and they respond with 16 - 4 = 12, instead of understanding that 3/4 is a proportion of the original amount.
- When a student is asked to find 1/2 of 24 and they respond with 24 - 12 = 12, but for the wrong reason, not understanding that 1/2 is being used to find a proportion, not to subtract from the original amount."
2155,"Reflects in an axis, instead of the given mirror line","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to reflect a shape or a point in a given mirror line, but they mistakenly reflect it in one of the coordinate axes (x-axis or y-axis) instead. This can happen when students are not fully understanding the concept of reflection and its relationship with mirror lines. They might assume that reflections can only occur in the x or y axes, or they might find it easier to reflect in these axes due to their familiarity with coordinate geometry.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When reflecting a shape in a diagonal mirror line, students might reflect it in the x-axis or y-axis instead, resulting in an incorrect reflection.
* When reflecting a point in a mirror line that is not parallel to the x or y axes, students might choose to reflect it in one of the axes, thinking it is the correct reflection.
* When solving problems involving reflections in multiple mirror lines, students might consistently reflect shapes or points in the axes instead of the given mirror lines, leading to a series of incorrect reflections."
2156,Thinks alternate angles are always equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the property of alternate angles in relation to parallel lines and transversals. They may believe that as long as two angles are alternate (i.e., on opposite sides of a transversal), they will always be equal, regardless of whether the lines cut by the transversal are parallel or not.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly assume that any pair of alternate angles are equal, without considering the necessary condition that the lines must be parallel. As a result, they may misapply the concept of alternate angles in various geometric contexts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When dealing with intersecting lines and a transversal, students may think that alternate angles are equal even though the lines are not parallel.
- When working with diagrams that involve multiple lines and transversals, students may incorrectly identify alternate angles as equal without checking if the lines are parallel.
- In problems involving angle calculations in polygons or other geometric shapes, students may apply the alternate angle property without verifying if the lines are parallel, leading to incorrect solutions."
2157,"Believes that when eliminating a variable, if the signs of the terms with matching coefficients are the same, we do the operation matching the sign (+ if positive, - if negative)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to eliminate variables in a system of linear equations. They mistakenly believe that when the coefficients of the variable to be eliminated are the same and have the same sign, the operation to eliminate the variable should match the sign of the coefficients. For example, if the coefficients are both positive, they think they should add the equations, and if the coefficients are both negative, they think they should subtract the equations.

This misconception can lead to incorrect solutions, as the operation to eliminate the variable actually depends on the signs of the coefficients in relation to each other, not just their individual signs.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: Eliminating a variable in a system of two linear equations with the same positive coefficients.
- Case 2: Eliminating a variable in a system of two linear equations with the same negative coefficients.
- Case 3: Solving a system of linear equations with multiple variables, where the coefficients of one variable are the same and have the same sign."
2158,Multiplies rather than divides when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with word problems involving ratios, proportions, or rates, and incorrectly apply multiplication instead of division to find the solution. The student might misunderstand the context of the problem or misinterpret the operation required, leading them to multiply the numbers given in the problem rather than dividing them.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- If a recipe for making 8 cakes requires 400g of flour, how much flour is needed to make 2 cakes? (Student multiplies 400g by 2 instead of dividing 400g by 4 to find the amount needed for 2 cakes.)
- A car travels 240 miles in 4 hours. How many miles does it travel per hour? (Student multiplies 240 miles by 4 hours instead of dividing 240 miles by 4 hours to find the distance traveled per hour.)
- A bookshelf has 18 books on it, and the librarian wants to put an equal number of books on 3 shelves. How many books will each shelf hold? (Student multiplies 18 books by 3 shelves instead of dividing 18 books by 3 shelves to find the number of books per shelf.)"
2159,Believes the fx column for calculating mean is value/frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean from a frequency table. They incorrectly assume that to find the mean, they need to divide each value by its corresponding frequency, and then sum up the results. In other words, they think the ""fx"" column in the table represents the value divided by the frequency (fx = value ÷ frequency), rather than the correct interpretation which is the value multiplied by the frequency (fx = value × frequency). This mistake can lead to an incorrect calculation of the mean.

Cases where the misconception will occur:

1. A frequency table is given with different values and their corresponding frequencies, and students are asked to calculate the mean.
2. A question requires students to find the mean of a dataset presented in a table, and they need to calculate the fx column.
3. Students are asked to calculate the mean of a set of data with repeating values, and they try to use the fx column to simplify the calculation."
2160,"In repeated percentage change, believes the second change is only a percentage of the first change, without including the original","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with repeated percentage changes, such as a price increase followed by another increase or a decrease. They mistakenly believe that the second percentage change is only applied to the amount of the first change, rather than the new total amount after the first change. In other words, they fail to account for the compounding effect of the second change on the original amount.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A store has a 10% sale on a £100 item, and then an additional 5% discount is applied. The student may think the second discount is only 5% of the £10 discount (50p), rather than 5% of the new price (£90).
- A population of bacteria increases by 20% in the first hour, and then by another 15% in the second hour. The student may think the second increase is only 15% of the 20% increase, rather than 15% of the new total population.
- An investment earns a 5% interest rate in the first year, and then earns an additional 3% interest rate in the second year. The student may think the second interest rate is only 3% of the 5% interest (0.15%), rather than 3% of the new total amount."
2161,Confuses octagon and hexagon,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty in identifying and differentiating between an octagon and a hexagon. An octagon is an eight-sided polygon, while a hexagon is a six-sided polygon. Students may struggle to recognize the distinct number of sides in each shape, often interchanging the two terms or incorrectly labeling one shape as the other.

This misconception may arise due to a lack of familiarity with the shapes, inadequate visual understanding, or insufficient practice in identifying and naming different polygons. As a result, students may exhibit confusion when dealing with problems involving these shapes in various mathematical contexts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify and name different polygons in a geometry problem, a student might incorrectly label an octagon as a hexagon or vice versa.
2. In a problem involving the perimeter of a polygon, a student may mistakenly calculate the perimeter of an octagon using the formula for a hexagon.
3. When asked to draw or create a specific polygon, a student might draw an octagon instead of a hexagon or vice versa, demonstrating their confusion between the two shapes.
4. In a real-world application, such as designing a building or a garden, a student might incorrectly use the terms octagon and hexagon, leading to misunderstandings or errors in their design.
5. When solving a problem involving symmetry or tessellations, a student's misconception about octagons and hexagons might lead to incorrect conclusions or patterns."
2162,"When rounding to decimal places and the only digits after the decimal point will be zeros, just gives the integer as the answer.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to round numbers to a specific decimal place. They mistakenly believe that if the digits after the decimal point are zeros, they can simply omit the decimal point and zeros, and provide the integer part as the answer. This misconception stems from a misunderstanding of the concept of rounding and the importance of maintaining the correct number of decimal places in the answer.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When rounding 10.00 to 2 decimal places, a student with this misconception may simply write 10, instead of 10.00.
- When rounding 5.000 to 3 decimal places, a student with this misconception may simply write 5, instead of 5.000.
- When rounding 24.0000 to 4 decimal places, a student with this misconception may simply write 24, instead of 24.0000.

This misconception can lead to incorrect answers, especially in situations where precision and accuracy are crucial, such as in scientific calculations, financial transactions, or engineering applications."
2163,Attempts to simplify ratio by subtracting from both sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of equivalent ratios. They may believe that simplifying a ratio involves subtracting the same number from both sides, rather than dividing or multiplying both sides by the same number. For instance, given the ratio 6:8, students may attempt to simplify it by subtracting 2 from both sides, resulting in 4:6, which is not the simplest form of the original ratio.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the number of boys to girls in a class, a student might try to simplify the ratio 15:20 by subtracting 5 from both sides, resulting in 10:15.
- When measuring ingredients for a recipe, a student might try to simplify the ratio of flour to sugar 8:12 by subtracting 2 from both sides, resulting in 6:10.
- When analyzing the ratio of wins to losses for a sports team, a student might try to simplify the ratio 18:24 by subtracting 6 from both sides, resulting in 12:18."
2164,Believes a number written in standard form is smaller than another number written in standard form if the number between 1 and 10 is smaller,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students compare numbers in standard form (also known as scientific notation) and mistakenly assume that the number with the smaller coefficient (the number between 1 and 10) is smaller. For example, they might think that 2 × 10^5 is smaller than 5 × 10^4 because 2 is smaller than 5, without considering the effect of the exponent (the power of 10) on the overall magnitude of the number.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Comparing the size of planets or stars, where numbers are often written in standard form due to their enormous sizes.
- Calculating the number of cells in the human body, where numbers are often written in standard form due to their large quantities.
- Measuring the distance between celestial objects, where numbers are often written in standard form due to their vast distances.

For instance, students with this misconception might incorrectly conclude that:

- 2 × 10^6 is smaller than 8 × 10^5 because 2 is smaller than 8.
- 4 × 10^8 is smaller than 9 × 10^7 because 4 is smaller than 9."
2165,Thinks that we cannot calculate the range of negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the concept of range is only applicable to sets of positive numbers. They may think that negative numbers cannot have a range because they are ""below zero"" and do not fit the typical understanding of a range as a measure of spread or dispersion. Students may struggle to comprehend how to calculate the range when the dataset includes negative numbers, as they might assume that the concept of range is only relevant to positive values.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to calculate the range of a dataset that includes only negative numbers, such as -5, -3, -2, and -1.
- When a dataset has both positive and negative numbers, and students are unsure how to handle the negative values when calculating the range, for example, -2, 0, 3, 5.
- When students are faced with word problems that involve temperature or financial data that include negative numbers, such as calculating the range of temperatures in a region that includes sub-zero temperatures."
2166,Adds up the variable column when asked for total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with data presented in a table or chart, particularly in a frequency table or a grouped data set. They mistakenly add up the values in the variable column (which represents the actual data values) instead of adding up the values in the frequency column (which represents the number of times each data value occurs). This leads them to calculate an incorrect total.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the total number of items in a grouped data set, students may add up the group values (e.g., the ages of people in a survey) instead of adding up the corresponding frequencies.
- In a frequency table, students might add up the values of the variable (e.g., test scores) instead of the frequencies of each score, resulting in an incorrect total number of observations.
- When working with categorical data, students might add up the category values (e.g., favorite colors) instead of the frequencies of each category, leading to an incorrect total count of responses."
2167,"When a subtraction of one positive number from another, results in a negative answer, they believe the answer is the sum of those 2 numbers with a negative sign put in front.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are subtracting a larger positive number from a smaller positive number. They mistakenly think that when the minuend (the number being subtracted from) is smaller than the subtrahend (the number being subtracted), the result is simply the sum of the two numbers with a negative sign added to it. For example, when subtracting 8 from 5, students with this misconception may think the result is -(5+8) = -13, instead of understanding that the correct calculation is 5 - 8 = -3.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- 3 - 7 = ?
- 2 - 9 = ?
- 10 - 15 = ?
- 8 - 12 = ?

In each of these cases, students with this misconception may incorrectly add the numbers together and place a negative sign in front, rather than performing the subtraction operation correctly."
2168,Assumes a 1:1 conversion ratio between different currencies,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that when converting one currency to another, the exchange rate is always 1:1. For example, a student with this misconception might believe that 1 US dollar is equal to 1 British pound or 1 euro. They may think that currency conversion is simply a matter of replacing the currency symbol, without considering the actual exchange rate.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Case 1: A student is traveling from the US to the UK and thinks that they can exchange 100 US dollars for 100 British pounds.
- Case 2: A student is comparing the price of a product in different countries and assumes that a product that costs $10 in the US will cost 10 euros in Europe.
- Case 3: A student is solving a math problem that involves converting currencies and assumes that the exchange rate is always 1:1, leading to incorrect calculations.
- Case 4: A student is working with real-world data, such as exchange rates, and fails to account for the actual conversion rates, leading to inaccurate conclusions."
2169,Believes that prime numbers can have more than two factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definition of prime numbers. They may think that prime numbers are just special numbers, but they don't fully grasp the unique characteristic of prime numbers, which is having only two distinct factors: 1 and themselves. As a result, they may incorrectly identify numbers with more than two factors as prime numbers.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify prime numbers from a given list, they may include numbers like 4, 6, or 9, which have more than two factors.
- When students are asked to factorize a number, they may incorrectly identify a composite number as prime, thinking that it has a special property that makes it prime.
- When students are solving problems involving prime numbers, such as finding the prime factors of a number, they may include incorrect prime numbers in their solution.
- When students are asked to generate a list of prime numbers, they may include numbers that have more than two factors, demonstrating their misunderstanding of the definition of prime numbers."
2170,Subtracts numerators when dividing fractions with a common denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing fractions that have the same denominator. They mistakenly believe that to divide these fractions, they need to subtract the numerators (the numbers on top) while keeping the denominator the same. For instance, given a problem like 3/8 ÷ 2/8, students with this misconception would subtract the numerators (3 - 2) and keep the denominator (8), resulting in an incorrect answer of 1/8.

This misconception likely stems from a misunderstanding of the concept of division and how it applies to fractions, as well as a possible overextension of the concept of subtracting numerators when comparing fractions with the same denominator.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Dividing two fractions with the same denominator, e.g., 5/10 ÷ 3/10.
- Simplifying complex fractions with common denominators, e.g., (4/8) / (2/8).
- Solving real-world problems involving the division of fractions with the same denominator, such as dividing ingredients for a recipe."
2171,Uses the total as the numerator of the fraction rather than the denominator.,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to express a part of a whole as a fraction, but they incorrectly place the total number of items as the numerator (the top number) instead of the denominator (the bottom number). For example, if a student is asked to find the fraction of a pizza that has 3 slices eaten out of a total of 8 slices, they might write the fraction as 8/3 instead of 3/8.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When counting blocks or toys and expressing a part of the total as a fraction.
- When dealing with real-life scenarios like sharing food or dividing a room, and the student needs to express a fraction of the whole.
- When solving problems involving parts of a shape, like finding the fraction of a circle that is shaded.
- When interpreting data and statistics, such as finding the fraction of students who like a particular subject.
- When solving word problems that involve fractions, like ""Tom has 12 pencils, and 4 of them are red. What fraction of his pencils are red?"""
2172,Subtracts instead of adding when asked to find a total,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they need to subtract numbers instead of adding them when asked to find a total or a sum. This could be due to a lack of understanding of basic arithmetic operations, confusion with the language used in the problem, or a misunderstanding of the concept of ""finding a total."" As a result, students may incorrectly subtract one number from another, leading to an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A basket contains 5 apples, and 4 more apples are added to it. A student with this misconception may write 5 - 4 = 1, instead of 5 + 4 = 9.
- Tom has £8 in his pocket, and his friend gives him £2 more. A student with this misconception may write £8 - £2 = £6, instead of £8 + £2 = £10.
- A bookshelf has 8 books, and 5 more books are added to it. A student with this misconception may write 8 - 5 = 3, instead of 8 + 5 = 13.
- Sarah has 10 pencils in her pencil case, and she buys 4 more. A student with this misconception may write 10 - 4 = 6, instead of 10 + 4 = 14."
2173,Does not realise that division can be used to find the missing value in a multiplication problem,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students view division and multiplication as separate operations, rather than inverse operations. They may understand that multiplication is used to find the product of two numbers, but they may not recognize that division can be used to ""undo"" multiplication and find a missing factor. As a result, when given a multiplication problem with a missing value, students may not think to use division to solve for the unknown.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* 3 × ___ = 12 (student may not think to use division to find the missing value)
* A bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books. If the bookshelf is currently empty, how many books can be placed on it in total? If 40 books are placed on it, and we want to know how many books are placed on each shelf, the student may struggle to find the answer.
* A group of friends want to share some sweets equally. If they have 36 sweets and there are 6 friends, the student may not think to use division to find out how many sweets each friend will get.
* A recipe calls for 4 groups of 6 eggs. If we have 24 eggs and want to know how many groups we can make, the student may not think to use division to find the answer."
2174,Believes a parallelogram cannot have right angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the properties of a parallelogram. They may think that a parallelogram is a specific type of quadrilateral with only obtuse or acute angles, and that the presence of right angles would make it a different shape, such as a rectangle. They may not realize that a parallelogram is a broader category of quadrilaterals that can include various types of angles, including right angles.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify the type of quadrilateral a shape is, and they see a shape with right angles, they may immediately assume it is a rectangle rather than a parallelogram.
* When students are given a set of properties of a shape, such as ""opposite sides are parallel"" and ""one angle is 90 degrees"", they may not consider the possibility that the shape is a parallelogram.
* When students are asked to draw examples of different types of quadrilaterals, they may not include a parallelogram with right angles, reinforcing their misconception that such a shape does not exist."
2175,"Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling, and not square rooted","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number means multiplying it by 2 or doubling it, and that finding the square root of a number means dividing it by 2 or halving it. They may also mistakenly apply these incorrect rules in reverse, thinking that multiplying by 2 or doubling is the same as squaring, and that dividing by 2 or halving is the same as finding the square root.

For example, this misconception may manifest in the following cases:

* When asked to find the square of 5, a student may answer 10 (doubling 5 instead of multiplying 5 by itself to get 25).
* When asked to find the square root of 16, a student may answer 8 (dividing 16 by 2 instead of finding the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 16, which is 4).
* When solving an equation like x^2 = 9, a student may think that x = 18 (doubling 9 instead of finding the square root of 9, which is 3).
* When asked to simplify an expression like 2^2, a student may think that it equals 4 because 2 is being ""doubled"", rather than recognizing that 2^2 means 2 multiplied by itself, which equals 4 (although this case may coincidentally produce a correct answer, the reasoning behind it is incorrect)."
2176,Confuses objective and subjective,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to distinguish between objective and subjective data or statements in Data and Statistics. Objective data is based on facts and is unbiased, whereas subjective data is influenced by personal opinions or feelings. Students may struggle to recognize the difference between these two types of data, leading them to interpret or present data incorrectly.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Case 1: When collecting data through surveys, students may ask leading questions that reflect their personal opinions, resulting in biased data.
- Case 2: When analyzing data, students may interpret the results based on their own experiences or assumptions rather than looking at the data objectively.
- Case 3: When presenting data, students may use language that is emotive or persuasive, rather than sticking to factual information.
- Case 4: When evaluating the credibility of sources, students may not consider the potential biases or motivations of the author, leading them to accept subjective data as objective fact."
2177,Does not know that a reflection would not change the size of the shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a reflection, which is a type of transformation in geometry, can alter the size of the original shape. They may think that the reflected shape will be larger or smaller than the original one, rather than understanding that a reflection only changes the shape's orientation or position, while maintaining its original size and shape.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When reflecting a shape over a line of symmetry, students may incorrectly assume that the reflected shape will be larger or smaller than the original shape.
- When comparing the original shape with its reflected image, students may mistakenly attribute differences in size to the reflection itself, rather than realizing that the size remains the same.
- When working with real-world examples, such as mirrors or reflective surfaces, students may incorrectly assume that the reflected image appears larger or smaller due to the reflection, rather than understanding that the size remains unchanged.
- When solving problems involving reflections, students may incorrectly calculate the size of the reflected shape, leading to incorrect answers."
2178,Believes mixed numbers cannot be simplified,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to mixed numbers, which are a combination of a whole number and a fraction. They may believe that once a mixed number is formed, it cannot be simplified further. This could be due to a lack of understanding of equivalent ratios or a misunderstanding of the relationship between whole numbers and fractions.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When adding or subtracting mixed numbers, students may not simplify the resulting mixed number, even if the fractional part can be reduced.
- When converting improper fractions to mixed numbers, students may not simplify the resulting mixed number, even if the fractional part can be reduced.
- When multiplying or dividing mixed numbers, students may not simplify the resulting mixed number, even if the fractional part can be reduced.
- When comparing mixed numbers, students may not recognize that two mixed numbers can be equivalent, even if they have different whole number parts and fractional parts.

For example, a student with this misconception may not recognize that 2 4/8 can be simplified to 2 1/2, or that 3 6/12 is equivalent to 3 1/2."
2179,Assumes that an arrow on a number line starts at zero,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any arrow drawn on a number line must start from zero. They may interpret the arrow as always indicating the entire range from zero to the number being represented, rather than understanding that the arrow is actually indicating the direction and the starting point can be anywhere on the number line. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect interpretations of number lines, especially when dealing with negative numbers, intervals, or scales that do not start at zero.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing a number line to represent a temperature scale, a student starts the arrow at zero, even if the temperature range is between -10°C and 10°C.
- A student is asked to draw an arrow to show the range of scores on a test, but they always start the arrow at zero, even if the lowest score is 40.
- When graphing an inequality on a number line, a student assumes the arrow must start at zero, rather than understanding that the arrow indicates the direction and can start at any point on the line."
2180,Divides instead of multiplies when calculating total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with data and statistics, particularly when dealing with grouped frequency tables or charts. They may incorrectly assume that to find the total frequency, they need to divide the frequency of each group by the number of groups, rather than multiplying the frequency of each group by the number of groups. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions about the data.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A student is given a table showing the frequency of different age groups in a population and is asked to find the total number of people. Instead of multiplying the frequency of each age group by the number of groups, they divide the frequency by the number of groups.
* A student is analyzing a bar chart showing the number of books sold in different genres and is asked to find the total number of books sold. They incorrectly divide the number of books sold in each genre by the number of genres, rather than multiplying the number of books sold in each genre by the number of genres.
* A student is working with a histogram showing the frequency of different exam scores and is asked to find the total number of students who took the exam. They mistakenly divide the frequency of each score range by the number of score ranges, rather than multiplying the frequency of each score range by the number of score ranges."
2181,Performs addition ahead of subtraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students believe that in mathematical expressions involving both addition and subtraction, the operation of addition should be performed before subtraction, regardless of the order in which they appear from left to right. This misunderstanding can stem from an overemphasis on the basic addition facts and a lack of understanding of the order of operations, which dictates that operations of equal precedence (such as addition and subtraction) should be performed from left to right.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly evaluate expressions where subtraction appears before addition. For example:

- Case 1: In the expression 5 - 2 + 1, a student with this misconception might first add 2 and 1 together to get 3, then subtract 3 from 5, resulting in an incorrect answer of 2.
- Case 2: In the expression 10 + 3 - 4, a student might first add 10 and 3 together correctly to get 13, but then, in a different expression like 10 - 3 + 4, incorrectly add 3 and 4 together first to get 7, then subtract 7 from 10.
- Case 3: In the expression 8 - 1 + 6, a student might incorrectly add 1 and 6 together first to get 7, then subtract 7 from 8, resulting in an incorrect answer of 1."
2182,Believes given two sides and one angle of a triangle there are multiple ways to draw the triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or have a limited understanding of the conditions that make a triangle unique. They may think that as long as they have two sides and an angle, they can create multiple triangles by adjusting the length of the third side or the position of the given angle. 

This misconception is often due to an incomplete understanding of the role of given information in determining a triangle's shape and size. Students may also incorrectly apply concepts related to the construction of triangles, such as not realizing that two sides and a non-included angle (SSA) do not necessarily define a unique triangle, while two sides and an included angle (SAS) do.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Given two sides of lengths 5 and 7 units, and a 30-degree angle, a student might think they can draw multiple triangles with the given information, not realizing that the angle must be included between the two given sides to determine a unique triangle.

2. When constructing a triangle with given sides of lengths 3 and 4 units and a 60-degree angle, a student may believe that they can adjust the length of the third side to create multiple triangles, without recognizing the restrictions imposed by the given information.

3. If a student is given two sides of lengths 6 and 8 units and a 90-degree angle, they might attempt to draw multiple right triangles by changing the position of the right angle or the length of the hypotenuse, without realizing that the given information already defines a unique triangle."
2183,Confuses consecutive and prime numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the definitions of consecutive numbers and prime numbers. Consecutive numbers are integers that follow one another in order, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. On the other hand, prime numbers are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify consecutive numbers as prime numbers or vice versa, leading to errors in various mathematical operations and problem-solving.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When asked to list the first 5 prime numbers, a student with this misconception might answer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, thinking that consecutive numbers are prime.
2. When solving a problem that requires finding the prime factors of a number, a student may incorrectly identify consecutive numbers (e.g., 4 and 5) as prime factors.
3. In a number sequence question, a student may mistakenly assume that a sequence of consecutive numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5) is a sequence of prime numbers.
4. When asked to determine if a number is prime or composite, a student with this misconception might incorrectly classify a consecutive number (e.g., 6) as prime simply because it follows a prime number (e.g., 5)."
2184,Believes the equation of a straight line is y=-mx+c,"Explanation: This misconception shows that the student has an incorrect understanding of the slope-intercept form of a linear equation. They believe that the equation of a straight line is y = -mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. However, this is incorrect because the slope-intercept form is actually y = mx + c, where m represents the slope and c represents the y-intercept. The negative sign before the 'm' suggests that the student may be confusing the concept of slope with the concept of negative slope, or they may be incorrectly assuming that all slopes are negative.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When graphing a linear equation and the student incorrectly plots the line with the opposite slope.
- When solving a system of linear equations and the student's incorrect equation leads to an incorrect solution.
- When finding the equation of a line given two points and the student writes the equation with the wrong slope.
- When interpreting the slope in real-world applications, such as calculating the cost of goods or the rate of change, and the student's incorrect understanding of slope leads to incorrect conclusions."
2185,Believes negative numbers with a larger absolute value are greater,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of negative numbers and their relationships. They might think that the larger the absolute value of a negative number, the greater the number is. For example, they might believe that -10 is greater than -5 because 10 is larger than 5. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the number line and the concept of negative numbers, where a larger absolute value actually represents a smaller value on the number line.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two negative numbers, such as -8 and -3, and thinking that -8 is greater because 8 is larger than 3.
- When ordering a set of negative numbers, such as -2, -5, and -9, and placing -9 as the greatest number because 9 is the largest absolute value.
- When solving inequalities or equations involving negative numbers, and incorrectly selecting the greater or lesser value based on the absolute value rather than the actual value on the number line."
2186,Thinks the missing length has to be half the length of the opposite side,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with shapes, particularly in the context of Geometry. They mistakenly believe that in a shape, the missing length must always be half the length of the opposite side. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

For example, this misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the missing length of a triangle, students might assume it's half the length of the opposite side, without considering the type of triangle (e.g., right-angled, isosceles) or using relevant geometric properties.
- In the context of quadrilaterals, students might apply this misconception to find the length of a diagonal or a missing side, without considering the properties of the specific type of quadrilateral (e.g., rectangle, rhombus).
- When solving problems involving the perimeter or area of shapes, students might incorrectly apply this rule, leading to incorrect calculations and answers."
2187,"When multiplying a decimal less than 1 by an integer, gives an answer 100 times smaller than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of decimal multiplication. They may think that multiplying a decimal less than 1 by an integer will result in a much smaller answer, specifically 100 times smaller. This error is likely due to a misunderstanding of the place value system and the effect of multiplication on decimals.

For example, when faced with the problem:

* 0.5 × 4 = ?

A student with this misconception might answer 0.02, which is 100 times smaller than the correct answer.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* 0.2 × 3 = ? (student answers 0.006 instead of 0.6)
* 0.8 × 2 = ? (student answers 0.016 instead of 1.6)
* 0.1 × 9 = ? (student answers 0.009 instead of 0.9)

This misconception highlights the need for students to develop a deeper understanding of decimal operations and the relationships between numbers."
2188,"Does not understand that enlargements can make shapes make shapes bigger, smaller and the same size","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that enlargements in geometry can result in three different outcomes: an increase in size, a decrease in size, or no change in size. They may believe that enlargements only make shapes bigger, neglecting the possibility of reductions or the preservation of the original size.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- When given a scale factor greater than 1, students may correctly apply it to enlarge a shape, but when given a scale factor between 0 and 1, they may struggle to understand that it results in a reduction in size.
- If the scale factor is equal to 1, students may not realize that the shape remains the same size, as the concept of an enlargement with no change in size may seem counterintuitive.
- When dealing with real-world applications of enlargements, such as scaling up or down a model, students may have difficulty understanding that the resulting shape can be bigger, smaller, or the same size, depending on the scale factor used."
2189,Believes isosceles triangles cannot have right angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the properties of isosceles triangles. They may believe that isosceles triangles can only have acute angles (less than 90 degrees) and that the presence of a right angle (exactly 90 degrees) is exclusive to right-angled triangles, which they may think are distinct from isosceles triangles. This misunderstanding can lead them to incorrectly conclude that a triangle cannot be both isosceles and right-angled.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When drawing or identifying isosceles triangles, students may avoid including right angles, thinking that it would make the triangle a different type.
2. When solving problems involving right-angled triangles, students may assume that the triangle cannot be isosceles, even if the lengths of two sides are equal.
3. When classifying triangles, students may incorrectly separate isosceles and right-angled triangles into distinct categories, thinking that they are mutually exclusive."
2190,Denominator used for other parts rather than total parts,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use the denominator of a fraction to represent the number of parts other than the total number of parts. In fractions, the denominator represents the total number of equal parts that the whole is divided into. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that the denominator refers to the number of parts that are not shaded or the number of parts of a different category.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing fractions: A student may think that the denominator of a fraction represents the number of parts that are not shaded, rather than the total number of parts. For instance, in the fraction 3/8, they might think the 8 represents the number of unshaded parts rather than the total number of parts.
- When creating equivalent fractions: A student may incorrectly change the denominator of a fraction to represent a different number of parts, rather than scaling the numerator and denominator to create an equivalent fraction.
- When adding or subtracting fractions: A student may incorrectly add or subtract the denominators, thinking that they represent different quantities, rather than finding a common denominator to combine the fractions.
- When solving problems involving proportions or ratios: A student may misinterpret the denominator as representing a different quantity, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.
- When interpreting pie charts or bar graphs: A student may think that the denominator of a fraction represents the number of parts of a different category, rather than the total number of parts."
2191,When writing a number as a percentage of another number gets them the wrong way around,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to express one number as a percentage of another number, but they incorrectly identify the base and the part. They may mistakenly take the part as the base and vice versa, resulting in a reversal of the percentage calculation.

For example, if asked to express 15 as a percentage of 75, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate 75 as a percentage of 15, leading to an incorrect answer. This misconception can arise due to a lack of understanding of the concept of percentages, specifically the relationship between the base and the part.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the percentage of students who scored above a certain grade in a class: Students may mistakenly calculate the total number of students as a percentage of the number of students who scored above the grade, rather than the other way around.
- Calculating the percentage increase in the price of a product: Students may incorrectly calculate the original price as a percentage of the new price, rather than the other way around.
- Expressing the number of votes for a particular candidate as a percentage of the total votes: Students may mistakenly calculate the total votes as a percentage of the votes for the candidate, rather than the other way around."
2192,Does not know you can find the mean from a pictogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the idea that pictograms, which are a form of data representation using pictures or symbols, can be used to calculate statistical measures such as the mean. They may believe that means can only be calculated from raw numerical data. As a result, they may struggle to extract information from pictograms and use it to calculate the mean.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When presented with a pictogram showing the number of books read by each student in a class, a student may not know how to use the pictogram to calculate the mean number of books read.
2. When asked to find the average score of a group of people based on a pictogram showing their individual scores, a student may not understand how to use the pictogram to calculate the mean.
3. When given a pictogram representing the number of hours spent on homework each day, a student may not know how to use the pictogram to calculate the mean number of hours spent on homework per day."
2193,Confuses tangent and circumference,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the tangent of a circle and its circumference. They may incorrectly believe that the tangent is a part of the circumference or vice versa. This confusion can lead students to incorrectly apply formulas or concepts related to the tangent and circumference, such as calculating the length of the tangent as if it were an arc of the circumference or using the formula for the circumference to find the length of the tangent.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When finding the length of a tangent from a point outside the circle to the point of tangency on the circle.
* When calculating the length of an arc of the circumference and mistakenly using the tangent instead.
* When solving problems involving the relationship between the radius, tangent, and circumference of a circle.
* When interpreting diagrams or graphs that involve circles, tangents, and arcs of the circumference.
* When solving problems that involve the use of trigonometric ratios, such as sine, cosine, and tangent, in relation to the circle."
2194,Assumes the scale is the same when comparing two similar diagrams,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that two similar diagrams may not have the same scale, leading them to make incorrect comparisons and calculations. They might assume that if two shapes or diagrams look the same, the measurements and proportions are identical, which is not necessarily the case. This misconception can lead to errors in calculating perimeter, area, and volume, as well as making incorrect conclusions about similarity and congruence.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing the areas of two similar triangles, where one is a scaled-up version of the other.
- Calculating the volumes of two similar 3D shapes, assuming the same scale factor applies to both.
- Determining the congruence of two shapes based solely on their visual similarity, without checking the scale.
- Solving problems involving similar diagrams with different scales, such as maps or architectural plans.
- Making assumptions about the proportions of a scaled-up or scaled-down model of a real-world object."
2195,Does not know the definition of a prime number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unclear or have a misunderstanding about the definition of a prime number. A student with this misconception may believe that a prime number is any odd number, any number that is not divisible by 2, or any number that is divisible by only one number. They may not fully understand that a prime number is actually a positive integer that is divisible only by itself and 1.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to identify prime numbers within a range, they may incorrectly include composite numbers that are odd, such as 9 or 15.
- When students are asked to factorize a composite number, they may struggle to identify the prime factors, leading to incorrect factorization.
- When students are asked to determine if a number is prime or composite, they may incorrectly classify a number as prime simply because it is odd or looks like a prime number.
- When students are working on problems that involve finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) or least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, their misunderstanding of prime numbers may lead to errors."
2196,Believes the number of bars gives the total on a bar chart,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the number of bars on a bar chart represents the total value or quantity being measured, rather than understanding that each bar represents a specific category or group, and the height or length of the bar indicates the value or quantity for that category. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly interpret the data and draw false conclusions. For instance, if a bar chart shows 5 bars, each representing a different color of shirt sold, with the height of each bar indicating the number of shirts sold, a student with this misconception might think that 5 shirts were sold in total, rather than understanding that the total number of shirts sold is the sum of the values represented by the heights of all 5 bars.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A bar chart shows the number of books read by students in different months, and a student thinks the number of bars (months) is the total number of books read.
- A bar chart displays the favorite sports of students in a class, and a student believes the number of bars (sports) is the total number of students in the class.
- A bar chart illustrates the amount of rainfall in different cities, and a student thinks the number of bars (cities) is the total amount of rainfall."
2197,Thinks you multiply parallel sides to find the area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with finding the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width, and they incorrectly apply the same concept to find the area of a trapezium. They mistakenly believe that multiplying the parallel sides of the trapezium will give them the correct area. This misunderstanding is often due to the fact that students are not fully grasping the unique properties of a trapezium and how its area is calculated differently from other shapes.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are given a trapezium with parallel sides of lengths 5cm and 7cm, and they incorrectly calculate the area as 5cm x 7cm = 35cm^2.
- When students are asked to find the area of a trapezium with parallel sides of lengths 10cm and 4cm, and they mistakenly multiply these sides to get an area of 40cm^2.
- When students are given a trapezium with parallel sides of lengths 8cm and 2cm, and they incorrectly calculate the area as 8cm x 2cm = 16cm^2."
2198,Finds the mode instead of the median,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the middle value of a dataset, but instead, they identify the value that appears most frequently, which is the mode. They may mistakenly believe that finding the most common value is the same as finding the middle value. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of clarity on the definitions of mode, median, and mean, or from difficulties in arranging and analyzing data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a dataset has a clear mode, but the mode is not the middle value (e.g., 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5).
- When students are asked to find the median of a dataset with an even number of values, but they focus on the most frequent value instead of finding the average of the two middle values (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5).
- When a dataset has multiple modes, and students incorrectly assume that one of the modes is the median (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4)."
2199,Divides by the numerator and multiplies by the denominator when finding a fraction of an amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding a fraction of an amount. They mistakenly believe that to find a fraction of an amount, they need to divide the amount by the numerator (the top number) and then multiply it by the denominator (the bottom number). This incorrect process can lead to wildly incorrect answers.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When finding a fraction of a quantity, e.g., ""Find 3/4 of 24"" and the student divides 24 by 3 and then multiplies by 4.
- When solving problems involving equivalent ratios, e.g., ""A recipe requires 2/3 cup of flour. If you want to make half the recipe, how much flour will you need?"" and the student incorrectly divides and multiplies the amounts.
- When calculating percentages, e.g., ""Find 2/5 of 150"" and the student incorrectly applies the division and multiplication process.
- When solving real-world problems, such as measuring ingredients for cooking, dividing a room into sections, or calculating a proportion of a quantity, and the student applies the incorrect process."
2200,Believes that when dividing an integer by a power of 10 you add zeroes after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of dividing by powers of 10, but misunderstand the process. They may believe that simply adding zeroes after the decimal point will give the correct result. For example, when dividing 12 by 100, they might think the result is 12.00 instead of 0.12. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of place value and how dividing by powers of 10 affects the placement of digits.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Dividing 5 by 100: Student might answer 5.00 instead of 0.05
* Dividing 25 by 1000: Student might answer 25.000 instead of 0.025
* Dividing 4 by 10: Student might answer 4.0 instead of 0.4
* Dividing 75 by 10000: Student might answer 75.0000 instead of 0.0075"
2201,Does not know the definition of a composite number,"Explanation: A student with this misconception may believe that any number that is not prime is a special number, or may think a composite number is a number that can only be divided by certain numbers. They may also confuse composite numbers with other types of numbers, such as even numbers, odd numbers, or prime numbers.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying composite numbers, a student may incorrectly identify a prime number as composite (e.g., 7 is composite because it can be divided by 1 and 7).
- When asked to list examples of composite numbers, a student may include numbers that are not composite, such as prime numbers (e.g., 3, 5, 11).
- When given a set of numbers and asked to identify which ones are composite, a student may incorrectly include numbers that are not composite, or may fail to recognize certain numbers as composite (e.g., 9 is not composite, but 6 is).
- When working with real-world problems, such as tiling a floor or dividing a pizza, a student may not recognize that certain numbers of items (e.g., 6 tiles, 9 slices) are composite and can be divided evenly in different ways."
2202,Thinks we have to add the base numbers as well as the powers when multiplying indices,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with the multiplication of numbers with the same base raised to different powers. They mistakenly believe that when multiplying these numbers, they need to add not only the exponents but also the base numbers themselves. For example, when multiplying 2^3 and 2^4, students with this misconception might think that the correct calculation involves adding both the powers (3+4) and the base numbers (2+2), resulting in an incorrect calculation of (2+2)^(3+4). This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the properties of exponents and how they are manipulated during multiplication.

Cases when the misconception will occur:
1. Multiplying 3^2 and 3^5: Students may think they need to calculate (3+3)^(2+5).
2. Simplifying 2^4 * 2^2: Students might attempt to calculate (2+2)^(4+2).
3. Evaluating (4^3) * (4^6): Students may incorrectly add the base numbers and exponents, resulting in (4+4)^(3+6)."
2203,Lines up the digits incorrectly when doing a subtraction involving two numbers with a different amount of digits,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are performing subtraction operations involving two numbers with a different number of digits. They may incorrectly line up the digits, often aligning the rightmost digits of both numbers instead of aligning the place values (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.). This misalignment can lead to incorrect calculations and answers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting a 2-digit number from a 3-digit number: 247 - 95
- Subtracting a 1-digit number from a 2-digit number: 56 - 8
- Subtracting a 3-digit number from a 4-digit number: 1052 - 278
- Subtracting a number with a different number of decimal places: 10.52 - 2.8"
2204,Believes the area of a rectangle is calculated by length add width,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of area as simply adding the dimensions of a rectangle, rather than understanding it as the product of the length and width. They may think that by adding the length and width, they are accounting for the entire space inside the rectangle. This misconception can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the concept of area as a measure of the amount of space inside a shape.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When calculating the area of a room, a student may add the length and width, thinking that a 4m x 5m room has an area of 9m, rather than 20m².
- When comparing the areas of different rectangles, a student may mistakenly think that a rectangle with a length of 6cm and a width of 4cm has the same area as a rectangle with a length of 5cm and a width of 5cm, since 6 + 4 = 10 and 5 + 5 = 10.
- When solving word problems involving area, a student may add the dimensions of a rectangular garden bed, thinking that a 3m x 2m bed has an area of 5m, rather than 6m²."
2205,Thinks the largest number in a stem and leaf diagram comes from the first leaf next to the largest stem,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand how to read and interpret stem and leaf diagrams. They mistakenly assume that the largest number in the diagram is formed by combining the largest stem with the first leaf next to it, rather than considering all the leaves associated with the largest stem and finding the largest one among them. This error is often due to a lack of understanding of how stem and leaf diagrams are constructed and how data is organized within them.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A stem and leaf diagram shows the scores of a test, and the largest stem is 8 with leaves 2, 5, 7, and 9. The student might incorrectly think the largest score is 82, rather than 89.
- A stem and leaf diagram displays the heights of students in a class, and the largest stem is 6 with leaves 0, 2, 5, and 8. The student might incorrectly think the tallest height is 60 inches, rather than 68 inches.
- A stem and leaf diagram shows the number of books read by students, and the largest stem is 5 with leaves 1, 3, 6, and 9. The student might incorrectly think the largest number of books read is 51, rather than 59."
2206,Added the values together instead of finding the percentage,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find a percentage increase or decrease, but instead of calculating the percentage, they simply add the values together. This is often due to a misunderstanding of the concept of percentages and how they are calculated. Students may think that finding a percentage is the same as adding a certain amount to the original value, rather than understanding that percentages represent a proportion of the original value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of £20. A student might calculate the sale price by adding £20 + £15, rather than finding 15% of £20 and subtracting it from the original price.
* A student scored 80% on a test and then scored 10% higher on a retake. A student might calculate the new score by adding 80 + 10, rather than finding 10% of the original score and adding it to the original score.
* A bakery is having a 20% off sale on all bread. A student might calculate the sale price of a £5 loaf of bread by adding £5 + £20, rather than finding 20% of £5 and subtracting it from the original price."
2207,Believes we can categorise data as primary or secondary without knowing the source,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that they can determine whether data is primary or secondary solely based on the data itself, without considering the source or the method of collection. They may think that certain types of data are inherently primary or secondary, regardless of how they were obtained. 

For example, they might assume that all survey data is primary data, or that all data from the internet is secondary data. However, this is not the case. The classification of data as primary or secondary depends on the context and the source of the data. 

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: A student is given a dataset on the number of hours people spend watching TV per day and assumes it is primary data without knowing whether it was collected through a survey or obtained from a pre-existing report.
- Case 2: A student finds data on the average rainfall in a region online and assumes it is secondary data without considering whether it was originally collected by the website's authors or obtained from a primary source, such as a meteorological station.
- Case 3: A student is given a table with data on the favorite sports of students in their school and assumes it is primary data, without knowing whether the data was collected through a school survey or obtained from a secondary source, such as a school report."
2208,"When writing ratio, writes total as one side","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly include the total quantity as one side of a ratio, rather than comparing the individual parts. For example, if there are 6 boys and 8 girls in a class, a student with this misconception might write the ratio of boys to girls as 6:14, where 14 is the total number of students. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the number of different colored marbles in a bag, a student might write the ratio of red to blue marbles as 5:15, where 15 is the total number of marbles.
- In a recipe, a student might write the ratio of flour to sugar as 2:5, where 5 is the total number of cups of ingredients.
- When analyzing the number of different types of pets in a neighborhood, a student might write the ratio of dogs to cats as 8:20, where 20 is the total number of pets."
2209,Confuses an expression with a variable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between an algebraic expression and a variable. An expression is a collection of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations combined, while a variable is a single letter or symbol representing a value. Students may mistakenly treat an entire expression as if it were a single variable, leading to incorrect manipulation and interpretation of the expression.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When simplifying expressions: Students might treat an expression like 2x + 3 as a single variable, failing to apply the correct order of operations or distribute coefficients correctly.
2. When solving equations: Students may attempt to isolate an entire expression, rather than the variable within it, leading to incorrect solutions.
3. When graphing functions: Students might confuse the function notation, such as f(x) = 2x + 1, with a variable, leading to incorrect graphing or interpretation of the function.
4. When working with word problems: Students may misinterpret the relationship between variables and expressions, leading to incorrect models or solutions to real-world problems."
2210,Ignores colours or design on shape when looking for symmetry,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students focus solely on the overall shape of an object and overlook the colours, patterns, or designs on it when determining its symmetry. They may assume that as long as the shape itself appears symmetrical, the colours or designs do not affect its symmetry. This can lead them to incorrectly identify a shape as symmetrical when, in fact, the colours or designs on it do not follow the same symmetry.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: A student is shown a picture of a butterfly with colourful wings and is asked to identify its line of symmetry. The student ignores the colours and patterns on the wings and only considers the overall shape of the butterfly, incorrectly assuming it has perfect symmetry.
- Case 2: A student is given a square with a design that is not symmetrical and is asked if it has rotational symmetry. The student ignores the design and focuses only on the square shape, incorrectly concluding that it has rotational symmetry.
- Case 3: A student is shown a circle with a non-symmetrical pattern of colours and is asked to identify its lines of symmetry. The student disregards the colours and assumes the circle has an infinite number of lines of symmetry, without considering the effect of the colours on its symmetry."
2211,Believes interquartile range is the sum of the lower and upper quartiles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the interquartile range (IQR) and think it is the sum of the lower quartile (Q1) and upper quartile (Q3) values, rather than the difference between them. They might assume that adding these two quartile values together will give them a measure of the spread of the data, rather than understanding that the IQR is a measure of the range of the middle 50% of the data.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the IQR from a set of data, a student adds the values of Q1 and Q3 together, rather than subtracting Q1 from Q3.
- When comparing the spread of data in two or more datasets, a student incorrectly concludes that the dataset with the higher sum of Q1 and Q3 has a greater spread, rather than considering the difference between Q3 and Q1.
- When plotting box plots, a student incorrectly labels the IQR as the sum of Q1 and Q3, rather than the difference between these values."
2212,Mixes up smallest and largest when ordering fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty comparing and ordering fractions, often mistakenly identifying the smallest fraction as the largest or vice versa. They may incorrectly assume that a fraction with a larger denominator is automatically larger than a fraction with a smaller denominator, without considering the relationship between the numerator and the denominator.

For example, when comparing the fractions 1/4 and 1/8, a student with this misconception may think that 1/8 is larger because 8 is greater than 4. Similarly, when comparing 3/4 and 2/3, they may incorrectly assume that 2/3 is larger because 3 is less than 4, without considering the relationship between the numerator and the denominator.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Comparing fractions with different denominators, e.g., 1/4 vs. 1/6
- Comparing fractions with different numerators, e.g., 2/4 vs. 3/4
- Ordering fractions in ascending or descending order, e.g., arranging the fractions 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3 in order from smallest to largest."
2213,Assumes regular shape refers only to a square,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the term ""regular shape."" They may believe that a regular shape must have four sides of equal length and four right angles, which is the definition of a square. They may not recognize that other shapes, such as equilateral triangles, regular pentagons, and regular hexagons, also meet the criteria of having equal sides and equal angles, making them regular shapes as well.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify examples of regular shapes in their everyday life, they may only point out squares and ignore other regular shapes.
- When given a task to draw or create regular shapes, students may only produce squares, demonstrating their narrow understanding of the term.
- In a geometry lesson, students may struggle to classify shapes as regular or irregular, incorrectly labeling non-square shapes as irregular, even if they have equal sides and angles.
- When solving problems involving perimeter or area of regular shapes, students may incorrectly assume that all regular shapes have the same properties as squares, leading to incorrect calculations."
2214,"Thinks that in the equation y=a, a is the gradient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of linear equations in the form of y = mx + c, where m represents the gradient (or slope) of the line and c represents the y-intercept. However, when they encounter the equation y = a, some students mistakenly assume that 'a' is the gradient of the line, possibly due to its position in the equation and lack of understanding of the context. 

In the equation y = a, 'a' actually represents a constant value that determines the position of the horizontal line on the y-axis, rather than the gradient. This misconception may occur when students are not properly introduced to the different forms of linear equations or when they fail to understand the context in which the equation is being used.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When graphing horizontal lines: Students may think that the value of 'a' affects the steepness of the line rather than its position on the y-axis.
- When comparing equations: Students might compare y = a to y = mx and assume that 'a' serves the same purpose as 'm', which is not the case.
- When solving problems: In problems where students are given the equation y = a and asked to find the gradient, they may incorrectly state that the gradient is 'a', rather than realizing that the gradient is actually 0 (since it's a horizontal line).
- When working with linear equations in different forms: Students might confuse the equation y = a with other forms of linear equations, such as y = mx + c, and incorrectly apply the concept of gradient to the value of 'a'."
2215,Does not recognise when to find a factor from a worded question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to identify situations in word problems where they need to find a factor of a given number. A factor is a whole number that divides another number exactly without leaving a remainder. In word problems, finding a factor is often necessary to solve real-life scenarios, but students may not recognize the cue words or phrases that indicate the need to find a factor.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A bookshelf has 18 books on it, and the librarian wants to put an equal number of books on 3 smaller shelves. How many books can each shelf hold? (Students may not recognize that they need to find a factor of 18 that represents the number of books each shelf can hold.)
- A pizza parlor has 24 slices of pizza to package in boxes. If they want to put an equal number of slices in each box, and they have boxes that hold 2, 3, 4, or 6 slices, how many boxes can they fill? (Students may not understand that they need to find the factors of 24 to determine the possible number of slices in each box.)
- A group of friends want to share some candy equally. If they have 36 pieces of candy and want to divide it among themselves in equal groups, how many friends can they divide the candy among so that each friend gets the same amount? (Students may not recognize that they need to find the factors of 36 to determine the possible number of friends.)"
2216,Believes the mean from grouped data something divided by the sum of the midpoint values,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the mean from grouped data, but they incorrectly believe that to find the mean, they need to divide the sum of something (likely the frequencies or the total of the data) by the sum of the midpoint values of the groups, rather than understanding that the mean is actually calculated by finding the sum of the products of the midpoints and their respective frequencies, and then dividing by the total frequency or number of data points.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are working with grouped data for the first time and are unsure about how to incorporate the midpoints of the groups into the calculation of the mean.
- When the groups have different widths or the data is not uniformly distributed, making it harder for students to understand the correct method of calculation.
- When the midpoints of the groups are provided, and students mistakenly believe that these midpoints are the key to finding the mean without considering the frequencies of the data points within each group.
- When students are asked to calculate the mean from a frequency table or histogram and they misinterpret the role of the midpoints in the calculation."
2217,Thinks subtracting a negative makes your answer smaller,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of subtracting a negative number. They believe that subtracting a negative number will decrease the value of the original number, making the answer smaller. This is because they may be thinking in terms of the word ""subtract"" meaning ""take away"", and assume that taking away a negative number will have a similar effect to taking away a positive number.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* Subtracting a negative number in a simple arithmetic problem: e.g., 5 - (-3) (students may think the answer is 2 or less than 5)
* Solving algebraic equations involving negative numbers: e.g., x - (-2) = 7 (students may think x is less than 7)
* Working with temperatures or other quantities that involve negative numbers: e.g., if the temperature is 5°C and it decreases by -2°C, students may think the new temperature is less than 5°C."
2218,Assumes that opposite angles are equal in a quadrilateral,"Explanation: This misconception assumes that in any quadrilateral, the opposite angles are always equal. However, this property only applies to specific types of quadrilaterals, such as parallelograms. In reality, not all quadrilaterals have equal opposite angles. This misconception may arise from the overgeneralization of the properties of parallelograms to all quadrilaterals.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to find the measure of an angle in a quadrilateral, students may assume the opposite angles are equal and calculate accordingly, even if the quadrilateral is not a parallelogram.
- When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral, students may incorrectly assume opposite angles are equal, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When classifying quadrilaterals, students may mistakenly identify a quadrilateral as a parallelogram solely based on the assumption that opposite angles are equal, without checking other necessary conditions.
- When dealing with more complex shapes, such as irregular quadrilaterals, students may continue to apply this misconception, leading to errors in their calculations and understanding."
2219,"Believes any co-interior angles are supplementary, not just those in parallel lines","Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the property of co-interior angles in parallel lines to all co-interior angles. They mistakenly believe that any pair of co-interior angles, regardless of the lines they are formed by, will always add up to 180 degrees. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions when dealing with angles in various geometric shapes and configurations.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When dealing with intersecting lines that are not parallel, students may incorrectly assume that the co-interior angles formed are supplementary.
- When working with angles in polygons, students may mistakenly apply the supplementary property to co-interior angles that are not formed by parallel lines.
- In problems involving angles in circles or other curved shapes, students may incorrectly assume that co-interior angles are supplementary, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When solving problems involving 3D shapes, students may misapply the supplementary property to co-interior angles formed by non-parallel planes."
2220,Mixes up term in a sequence and position of a term,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the term itself and its position in a sequence. In a sequence, each element is called a term, and it has a specific position, usually denoted by the term number (e.g., first term, second term, etc.). Students with this misconception may mistakenly refer to the term number as the term itself or vice versa.

For example, in the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, students might say that the term is 3 when asked to identify the third term, instead of saying the third term is 8. This confusion can lead to incorrect answers and misunderstandings in various sequence-related problems.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Identifying a specific term in a sequence (e.g., ""What is the fifth term in the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, ...?"")
- Finding the position of a given term in a sequence (e.g., ""What position is the term 24 in the sequence 4, 8, 12, 16, ...?"")
- Understanding sequence notation (e.g., ""What does a_n represent in the sequence a_1, a_2, a_3, ...?"")"
2221,Has made an order of operations mistake when writing a formula from a given situation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly apply the order of operations when translating a real-world situation into a mathematical formula. The order of operations is a set of rules that dictates the order in which mathematical operations should be performed when there are multiple operations in an expression. The most common mnemonic used to remember the order of operations is BIDMAS (or PEMDAS in some countries), which stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly prioritize certain operations over others, leading to an incorrect formula. For example, they may perform addition or subtraction before multiplication or division, or they may neglect to evaluate expressions inside brackets first.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Writing a formula that adds or subtracts before multiplying or dividing, e.g., writing 2 + 3 × 4 as 2 + 3 = 5, then multiplying 5 by 4.
* Neglecting to evaluate expressions inside brackets, e.g., writing 2 × (3 + 4) as 2 × 3 + 4.
* Performing operations in the wrong order when there are multiple operations of the same type, e.g., writing 12 ÷ 3 + 4 as 12 + 4 = 16, then dividing 16 by 3.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

Case 1: Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils each. He also has 2 extra pencils. A student with this misconception may write the formula as 3 + 2 × 4 = ?, instead of the correct formula 3 × 4 + 2 = ?.

Case 2: A bakery sells 250 loaves of bread per day. They pack 12 loaves per box. If they operate for 5 days, a student with this misconception may write the formula as 250 + 5 × 12 = ?, instead of the correct formula 250 × 5 ÷ 12 = ?.

Case 3: A water tank can hold 1200 liters of water. 300 liters of water are already in the tank. If 4 pipes fill the tank at a rate of 10 liters per minute each, a student with this misconception may write the formula as 1200 - 300 + 4 × 10 = ?, instead of the correct formula 1200 - 300 + (4 × 10) × t = ?, where t is the time in minutes."
2222,Out by 10 when subtracting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students consistently make an error of 10 units when performing subtraction calculations, often due to incorrect regrouping, miscounting, or misunderstandings of the concept of place value. This can also happen when students are subtracting numbers with different numbers of digits or when they are subtracting numbers that involve regrouping or borrowing.

Examples of cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting numbers that require regrouping: 54 - 27 = ? (Student answers 37 instead of 27)
- Subtracting numbers with different numbers of digits: 104 - 75 = ? (Student answers 35 instead of 29)
- Subtracting numbers with zeros: 105 - 95 = ? (Student answers 5 instead of 10)
- Subtracting numbers that involve multiple regroupings: 457 - 278 = ? (Student answers 189 instead of 179)"
2223,"When dividing fractions, divides the denominators by each other","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing fractions and mistakenly apply the division operation to the denominators instead of inverting the second fraction and multiplying. They may think that dividing fractions is similar to dividing whole numbers, where they would divide the corresponding parts (in this case, the denominators). This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect results and confusion when working with fractions.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When dividing two simple fractions, such as 1/2 ÷ 1/4, students may incorrectly divide the denominators (2 ÷ 4) instead of inverting the second fraction and multiplying.
- When solving problems involving real-world applications, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe, students may misapply this concept and get incorrect results.
- In algebra, when simplifying complex expressions involving fractions, this misconception can lead to errors and confusion."
2224,Does not recall larger square numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to recall larger square numbers, such as 6², 7², 8², etc. This can be due to a lack of practice or memorization of the times tables, particularly the squares of numbers beyond 5. Students may struggle to recall these larger square numbers, which can hinder their ability to solve mathematical problems involving squares, square roots, and other related concepts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When asked to calculate the area of a square with a side length greater than 5 units.
* When solving problems involving Pythagoras' theorem, which requires the use of square numbers.
* When simplifying algebraic expressions involving squares, such as (x+6)².
* When working with square roots, such as finding the square root of 64 (which is 8, a larger square number).
* When solving mathematical puzzles or brain teasers that involve larger square numbers."
2225,Thinks signs are interchangeable when adding or subtracting positive and negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the signs of numbers can be swapped or interchanged when performing addition or subtraction operations involving positive and negative numbers. They may think that the order of the signs does not matter, and that a negative sign can be replaced with a positive sign, or vice versa, without changing the result of the calculation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding a positive number to a negative number, students may incorrectly swap the signs, thinking that, for example, 3 + (-4) is the same as 3 - 4, or that (-3) + 4 is the same as 3 + 4.
- When subtracting a negative number from a positive number, students may mistakenly change the signs, thinking that, for example, 5 - (-3) is the same as 5 - 3, or that 5 - (-3) is the same as 5 + 3, but without understanding the correct rule.
- When subtracting a positive number from a negative number, students may incorrectly swap the signs, thinking that, for example, (-5) - 3 is the same as (-5) + 3, or that (-5) - 3 is the same as 5 - 3."
2226,Incorrect use of scale on a diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize the importance of scale in diagrams, leading to incorrect measurements and calculations. They may assume that the diagram is drawn to actual size or that the scale is irrelevant, resulting in misinterpretation of lengths, angles, and other geometric properties. Students may also struggle to apply scale factors, incorrectly applying them to certain parts of the diagram while neglecting others.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Assuming a diagram is drawn to scale when it's not, leading to incorrect measurements and calculations.
* Failing to apply scale factors consistently, resulting in distorted proportions.
* Misinterpreting the scale, leading to incorrect conversions between units (e.g., centimeters to meters).
* Ignoring the scale altogether, using actual measurements instead of scaled measurements.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* Case 1: A student is asked to find the area of a room based on a floor plan. They assume the diagram is drawn to actual size and use a ruler to measure the dimensions, resulting in an incorrect calculation.
* Case 2: A student is given a scaled diagram of a building and asked to find the height of a specific wall. They fail to apply the scale factor, resulting in an incorrect measurement.
* Case 3: A student is tasked with creating a scaled drawing of a geometric shape. They misinterpret the scale, leading to incorrect proportions and a distorted shape."
2227,Subtracts rather than adds when using Pythagoras to find the hypotenuse,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. Instead of adding the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, they mistakenly subtract one from the other. This may be due to a misunderstanding of the formula (a^2 + b^2 = c^2) or a lack of understanding of the concept of Pythagoras' theorem. 

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When finding the length of a shadow in a problem involving right-angled triangles and the sun's rays.
- When determining the distance between two points on a coordinate grid that form a right-angled triangle.
- When solving problems involving right-angled triangles in real-world contexts, such as construction or design.
- When working with problems that involve multiple right-angled triangles and require the use of Pythagoras' theorem multiple times.
- When solving problems that involve using Pythagoras' theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, and then using that length to find other values, such as the area or perimeter of the triangle."
2228,Does not know what a Fibonacci sequence is,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or have not been introduced to the concept of the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on). This lack of understanding may lead students to struggle with recognizing and generating the sequence, as well as understanding its applications in mathematics and real-world contexts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify or generate a sequence of numbers and are unable to recognize the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence.
- When solving problems involving the Fibonacci sequence in algebra, such as finding the nth term of the sequence.
- When exploring the relationship between the Fibonacci sequence and geometry, such as the arrangement of leaves on stems or the branching of trees.
- When analyzing data and statistics that exhibit Fibonacci-like patterns, such as population growth or financial markets.
- When applying mathematical concepts, such as ratios and proportions, to real-world problems that involve the Fibonacci sequence."
2229,Believes the mean is something divided by total,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a partial understanding of the concept of mean, but they don't fully grasp the idea that the mean is calculated by summing all the values and then dividing by the total number of values. Instead, they think the mean can be found by simply dividing something (not necessarily the sum of the values) by the total number of values. They might not understand what exactly should be divided by the total, leading to incorrect calculations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the mean of a set of exam scores, a student might think that the highest score should be divided by the total number of students.
- When finding the average height of a group of people, a student might think that the height of the tallest person should be divided by the total number of people.
- When calculating the mean of a set of temperatures, a student might think that the temperature on the first day should be divided by the total number of days."
2230,substitutes incorrectly,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly substitute values into algebraic expressions, equations, or formulas. They may misunderstand the relationship between variables, constants, and mathematical operations, leading to incorrect replacements. This can be due to a lack of understanding of algebraic notation, poor attention to detail, or inadequate practice in substituting values.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Substituting values into simple equations, such as 2x + 3, where students may incorrectly replace the variable x or the constant 3.
- Replacing values in formulas, such as the area of a rectangle (A = length × width), where students may confuse the length and width values.
- Substituting values into expressions with multiple variables, such as 2x + 5y, where students may incorrectly replace one or both variables.
- Solving word problems that require substitution, such as ""Tom has 5 more than 3 times the number of pencils as his friend,"" where students may incorrectly substitute the values into an equation."
2231,Thinks cross section of a prism can be any face,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any face of a prism can be considered as its cross-section. They may think that a cross-section is simply a view of the prism from any side, rather than a specific type of view that shows the internal structure of the prism. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly identify the shape and size of the cross-section, which can have implications for calculations involving volume, surface area, and other geometric properties.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to identify the cross-section of a rectangular prism and they choose a side view or a front view instead of the correct cross-sectional view.
* When students are working with 3D models or diagrams of prisms and they confuse the cross-section with other views or projections of the prism.
* When students are solving problems that involve finding the area or volume of a prism and they use an incorrect cross-section to make their calculations.
* When students are asked to describe the properties of a prism, such as its symmetry or internal structure, and they incorrectly refer to any face as a cross-section."
2232,Thinks that perpendicular lines do not meet at 90 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a misunderstanding of the definition of perpendicular lines. They may think that perpendicular lines are simply lines that intersect or cross each other, without understanding the specific requirement that they must meet at a 90-degree angle. This misconception may be due to a lack of exposure to precise definitions or a failure to grasp the concept of right angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify perpendicular lines in a diagram, they may incorrectly identify lines that intersect at angles other than 90 degrees.
- When students are asked to draw perpendicular lines, they may draw lines that intersect at angles other than 90 degrees, thinking that the lines are still perpendicular.
- When solving problems involving right triangles, students may not recognize that the intersection of the two shorter sides (the legs) forms a 90-degree angle, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When working with real-world applications, such as building design or engineering, students may not understand the importance of ensuring that lines are perpendicular to each other, leading to potential design flaws or structural issues."
2233,Thinks the reciprocal of a fraction is what number adds to that fraction to make one whole.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of reciprocals and confuse it with the idea of adding a fraction to reach a whole. They believe that the reciprocal of a fraction is the number that, when added to the original fraction, equals 1. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the definition of a reciprocal, which is actually the inverse of a fraction, obtained by swapping the numerator and denominator.

Cases when this misconception may occur:

- When simplifying fractions in algebra, such as in the process of solving equations involving fractions.
- In geometry, when working with similar shapes and scale factors, which often involve fractions and reciprocals.
- In problems involving ratios and proportions, where reciprocals are used to compare quantities.
- When working with equivalent fractions, where students may think that adding a certain fraction to the original fraction will make it whole, rather than understanding the concept of equivalent ratios."
2234,Forgets to change the numerators when finding equivalent fractions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding equivalent fractions by multiplying or dividing the denominators, but they forget to apply the same operation to the numerators. As a result, they incorrectly assume that changing the denominator is enough to create an equivalent fraction. 

This misconception can be seen in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions: A student might simplify the fraction 6/12 to 6/6, instead of 1/2, by dividing only the denominator by 2.
- When comparing fractions: A student might compare 2/4 and 3/6 by only looking at the denominators and incorrectly conclude that they are not equivalent because the denominators are different, without realizing that the numerators should also be adjusted.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators: A student might add 1/4 and 1/6 by finding a common denominator (12) but forget to multiply the numerators accordingly, resulting in an incorrect calculation of 1/12 + 1/12 instead of 3/12 + 2/12.
- When converting between fractions and decimals: A student might convert the fraction 3/4 to a decimal by dividing only the denominator by 4, resulting in 3/1 or 3, instead of dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get 0.75."
2235,Gives the first significant figure when asked for the second,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify the second significant figure in a given number, but instead, they provide the first significant figure. This indicates a lack of understanding of the concept of significant figures, which are the digits in a number that are known to be reliable and certain. Significant figures are crucial in mathematics and science to convey the precision and accuracy of measurements and calculations.

Students with this misconception may not fully comprehend the rules for determining significant figures, such as counting from the first non-zero digit, or they may be unable to distinguish between the first and second significant figures.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify the second significant figure in the number 456.78, the student responds with 4 (the first significant figure) instead of 5 (the second significant figure).
- In a measurement of 2345.6 meters, the student incorrectly states that the second significant figure is 2, when in fact, it is 3.
- Given the number 987.654, the student mistakenly identifies the second significant figure as 9 instead of 8."
2236,Does not know that co-interior angles sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware that co-interior angles, which are the angles on the same side of the transversal line and inside two parallel lines, have a specific relationship. They may believe that these angles have no specific connection or sum to a different value. As a result, when dealing with problems involving parallel lines and transversals, they may incorrectly calculate or ignore the relationship between co-interior angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When identifying the angles formed by a transversal line intersecting two parallel lines, a student may think that co-interior angles are simply adjacent angles with no specific sum.
- In a problem requiring the calculation of an unknown angle, a student may ignore the fact that co-interior angles sum to 180 degrees and instead use a different method or formula.
- When solving problems involving parallel lines and transversals in the context of real-world applications, such as architecture or engineering, a student's misconception about co-interior angles can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions."
2237,"Thinks the more digits a number has the greater it is, regardless of place value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students focus solely on the number of digits in a number, rather than considering the actual value of the digits and their respective place values. They may believe that a number with more digits is always greater than a number with fewer digits, without taking into account the magnitude of the digits themselves.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

* Comparing 100 and 25: A student may think 100 is greater than 25 because it has 3 digits, while 25 only has 2 digits.
* Comparing 1000 and 500: A student may think 1000 is greater than 500 because it has 4 digits, while 500 only has 3 digits, without realizing that 500 is half of 1000.
* Comparing 0.1 and 0.012: A student may think 0.012 is greater than 0.1 because it has more digits, without understanding the concept of decimal places and place value."
2238,Divides rather than multiplies when scaling up in direct proportion problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with direct proportion problems, where they need to scale up a quantity by a certain factor. Instead of multiplying the original quantity by the scale factor, they incorrectly divide it. This shows a misunderstanding of the concept of direct proportion, where an increase in one quantity results in a corresponding increase in the other quantity. Students may mistakenly apply the inverse operation, thinking that scaling up means dividing instead of multiplying.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* A recipe for 4 people requires 200g of flour. If the student needs to make the recipe for 8 people, they may divide 200g by 2 instead of multiplying it by 2.
* A car travels 120 miles in 2 hours. If the student needs to find out how far it will travel in 4 hours, they may divide 120 miles by 2 instead of multiplying it by 2.
* A group of friends want to share some sweets in a ratio of 2:3. If they have 10 sweets to share and the ratio needs to be scaled up by a factor of 3, the student may divide the sweets by 3 instead of multiplying the ratio by 3."
2239,Thinks there are 50 weeks in a year,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that since there are approximately 50 weeks of school or work in a year, or possibly 50 weeks from January to December if they miscount, there are 50 weeks in a calendar year. However, this thinking fails to consider the exact number of days in a year and how weeks are actually structured within that timeframe.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are calculating weekly allowance or earnings and mistakenly think they will receive 50 payments in a year.
- When estimating the duration of a project or activity that is scheduled on a weekly basis, they might incorrectly plan for 50 weeks.
- When trying to calculate the number of weeks until a birthday or holiday that falls on the same day each year, the student may think it's 50 weeks away instead of the actual number.
- When solving math problems involving yearly and weekly timeframes, such as finding out how many weeks a certain event will last in a year.
- When analyzing data or statistics that are given on a weekly basis, the student may assume there are 50 data points for a full year, leading to incorrect conclusions."
2240,"When factorising a quadratic with a non-unit coefficient of x squared, believes that coefficient will be in front of both x terms in the factorised form","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are factorising quadratics of the form ax^2 + bx + c, where a is not equal to 1. They incorrectly assume that when factorising, the coefficient 'a' will be distributed to both x terms in the factorised form, resulting in (ax + d)(ax + e). This shows a misunderstanding of how the coefficient of x^2 affects the factorisation process.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- Factorising the quadratic 2x^2 + 5x + 3, a student may write (2x + 2)(2x + 1.5) instead of finding the correct factors.
- When factorising 3x^2 + 2x - 5, a student may incorrectly write (3x - 2)(3x + 2.5).
- Factorising 4x^2 + 8x + 4, a student may write (4x + 2)(4x + 2) instead of simplifying the expression correctly."
2241,Confuses triangular prism with pyramid,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty distinguishing between two 3D shapes: triangular prisms and pyramids. They may think that any 3D shape with triangular faces is a pyramid, or they may believe that a triangular prism is a type of pyramid. This confusion can stem from the fact that both shapes have triangular faces, but students may not fully understand the structural differences between the two shapes.

In the case of a triangular prism, it has two identical triangular faces that are parallel to each other, with rectangular faces connecting them. On the other hand, a pyramid has a single base (which can be a triangle, square, or other polygon) and multiple triangular faces that meet at the apex.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to identify and name different 3D shapes.
- When students are tasked with creating or drawing their own 3D shapes.
- When students are solving problems involving surface area or volume of 3D shapes.
- When students are working with real-world objects that resemble triangular prisms or pyramids, such as a roof or a building."
2242,Converts a fraction to a decimal by placing the denominator after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the process of converting a fraction to a decimal. They incorrectly assume that the decimal equivalent can be obtained by simply placing the denominator after the decimal point, without understanding the need to perform a division operation. For example, when converting the fraction 3/4, they might write 3.4, instead of dividing 3 by 4 to get 0.75.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- Converting simple fractions like 1/2, where the student might write 1.2 instead of 0.5.
- Working with fractions that have denominators of 10 or 100, where the student might confuse the decimal placement, e.g., 3/10 becoming 3.10 instead of 0.3.
- Solving problems that involve comparing fractions and decimals, where the incorrect conversion can lead to wrong comparisons and conclusions.
- Real-world applications, such as cooking or measurement, where accurate conversions between fractions and decimals are crucial for achieving the desired results."
2243,Believes quartiles are at 1/4 and 3/4 through the range of the data,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the lower quartile (Q1) is located at one-fourth of the range of the data (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values) from the minimum value, and the upper quartile (Q3) is located at three-fourths of the range from the minimum value. They may think that dividing the range into four equal parts will give them the correct positions of the quartiles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding quartiles for a dataset with a large range, students might assume that Q1 is one-fourth of the range from the minimum value and Q3 is three-fourths of the range from the minimum value.
- When dealing with a dataset that has not been ordered or sorted, students might apply the incorrect method of finding quartiles by dividing the range, as it seems like a quick and easy solution.
- When students are working with datasets that have a relatively small number of data points, they might not realize the importance of arranging the data in order and then finding the median and the middle values of the two halves to determine the quartiles.
- When comparing multiple datasets, students might assume that the same method of dividing the range applies to all datasets, without realizing that this approach does not give accurate results."
2244,"Thinks there are 10,000g in a kilogram","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between grams (g) and kilograms (kg). They may know that 1 kilogram is a larger unit of measurement than 1 gram, but incorrectly assume that 1 kilogram is equal to 10,000 grams. This might be due to a lack of understanding of the metric system or the prefixes used in measurement units.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When converting between grams and kilograms in a recipe, a student might think that 1 kilogram of sugar is equal to 10,000 grams, resulting in incorrect measurements.
- During a science experiment, a student may need to measure the mass of an object in kilograms, but incorrectly convert it to 10,000 grams, affecting the accuracy of their results.
- When solving a math problem that involves converting between units of measurement, a student with this misconception might write 1 kg = 10,000 g, leading to incorrect calculations."
2245,"When using the formula to solve a quadratic equation, believes that a, b and c are always taken from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd terms, respectively, of the quadratic. ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a. They mistakenly believe that the coefficients a, b, and c are assigned based on their position in the quadratic equation, rather than understanding that a is the coefficient of the squared term, b is the coefficient of the linear term, and c is the constant term.

For example, in the quadratic equation x² + 5x + 6, students with this misconception would correctly identify a = 1, b = 5, and c = 6. However, when faced with a quadratic equation in a different form, such as 3x² - 2x - x + 1, they may incorrectly identify a = 3, b = -2, and c = -1, instead of combining like terms to get 3x² - 3x + 1 and then identifying a = 3, b = -3, and c = 1.

This misconception can also occur when the quadratic equation is not written in standard form. For instance, in the equation x² + 2x - 3 = 0, students may correctly identify a, b, and c. But if the equation is written as x² + 2x = 3, they may mistakenly identify the constant term as 0 instead of rearranging the equation to its standard form x² + 2x - 3 = 0. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- Quadratic equations with like terms, such as 2x² + 3x + 2x + 1.
- Quadratic equations not in standard form, such as x² + 2x = 3.
- Quadratic equations with negative coefficients or constants, such as -x² + 2x - 3 = 0.
- Quadratic equations with fractional or decimal coefficients, such as (1/2)x² + 2x + 3 = 0."
2246,Answers as if there are 10 seconds in a minute when changing from seconds to minutes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert a time given in seconds to minutes. They mistakenly assume that there are 10 seconds in a minute, rather than 60 seconds. As a result, when converting from seconds to minutes, they may divide the number of seconds by 10 instead of 60. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between seconds and minutes or a simple calculation error.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- When converting 120 seconds to minutes, a student may answer 12 minutes instead of 2 minutes.
- If asked to convert 300 seconds to minutes, a student may respond with 30 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
- When solving a problem that involves converting 90 seconds to minutes, a student may answer 9 minutes instead of 1.5 minutes."
2247,Does not understand that a number is divisible by the factors of its factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the transitive property of divisibility. They may understand that a number can be divided by its factors, but they do not extend this understanding to recognize that the factors of those factors also divide the original number. For example, if a number is divisible by 12, students with this misconception may not realize that it is also divisible by the factors of 12, such as 2, 3, 4, and 6.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying fractions: A student may not recognize that a fraction can be simplified further by dividing both the numerator and denominator by a common factor that is a factor of one of the original factors.
- When finding the greatest common divisor (GCD): A student may not consider the factors of the factors of the given numbers, leading to an incomplete list of possible common divisors.
- When solving problems involving multiples and factors: A student may not recognize that a number is a multiple of a given factor if it is also a multiple of one of that factor's factors.
- When working with equivalent ratios: A student may not understand that equivalent ratios can be created by multiplying or dividing both parts of the ratio by a factor of one of the original parts."
2248,Halves when asked to find the square root,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that finding the square root of a number is equivalent to simply halving it. They may think that the square root operation involves dividing the number by 2, rather than finding a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, when asked to find the square root of 16, a student with this misconception might answer 8, thinking that they need to divide 16 by 2 to find the square root.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with perfect squares that are also even numbers, such as 4, 16, or 36.
- When working with fractions or decimals, where the student might mistakenly apply the ""halving"" rule.
- In word problems or real-world applications where the context might lead students to think that finding the square root is a simple matter of dividing by 2.
- In situations where students are working under time pressure or lack confidence in their math abilities, leading them to rely on an incorrect rule of thumb rather than thinking through the problem more carefully."
2249,Confuses calculations for cumulative frequency and estimated total from a grouped frequency table,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between calculating the cumulative frequency and estimating the total from a grouped frequency table. They may incorrectly add or multiply the frequencies or midpoints, leading to incorrect calculations. This can occur when students misunderstand the concept of cumulative frequency, which represents the running total of frequencies up to a certain point, and the estimated total, which involves using the midpoint of each class interval to estimate the total value.

Cases where the misconception may occur:

- When asked to find the cumulative frequency up to a certain class interval, students may incorrectly add the frequencies of all classes instead of only adding the frequencies up to the specified class.
- When estimating the total from a grouped frequency table, students may multiply the frequency by the class boundary instead of the midpoint, leading to an incorrect estimate.
- When dealing with a grouped frequency table with varying class widths, students may incorrectly calculate the cumulative frequency or estimated total by failing to account for the different class widths.
- When faced with a word problem involving real-world data, such as exam scores or heights, students may misapply the concepts of cumulative frequency and estimated total, leading to incorrect conclusions."
2250,Believes the difference between triangle numbers remains the same,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that the difference between consecutive triangle numbers follows a constant pattern, meaning they believe the difference between each pair of consecutive triangle numbers remains the same. However, this is not the case. Triangle numbers are a sequence of numbers in which each number can be represented as a triangle with dots, and the sequence is formed by adding consecutive integers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.). The difference between consecutive triangle numbers actually increases by 1, then 2, then 3, and so on.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to identify the next number in the triangle number sequence, they might incorrectly assume the difference between the previous two numbers will remain the same and add that same difference to the last number.
- When comparing the differences between pairs of consecutive triangle numbers, students might incorrectly conclude that the differences are the same.
- When solving problems involving triangle numbers, students might incorrectly apply the assumption of a constant difference, leading to incorrect calculations and answers."
2251,Chooses the correct scale when measuring angles on a protractor but starts from the wrong number when the angle is in between two labelled dashes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand the concept of using a protractor to measure angles but incorrectly apply it when the angle's vertex falls between two labelled dashes on the protractor. They may accurately choose the correct scale (degrees, for instance) but then incorrectly determine the starting point of the measurement. Instead of starting from the zero line or a specific dash that aligns with one of the angle's arms, they may start counting from a nearby labelled dash, which is not aligned with the angle's arm. This incorrect starting point will lead to an incorrect measurement of the angle.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When measuring a 37° angle, a student starts counting from the 40° dash because it's the nearest labelled dash to one of the angle's arms.
2. A student tries to measure a 92° angle, but since the vertex falls between the 90° and 100° dashes, they start counting from the 90° dash instead of the zero line or the actual starting point of the angle.
3. When measuring a 143° angle, a student incorrectly starts counting from the 140° dash because it's the closest labelled dash, even though the angle's vertex is not exactly on that dash."
2252,Believes you multiply the constant difference by the term number to get the term value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of arithmetic sequences. They mistakenly believe that to find a specific term in a sequence, they need to multiply the constant difference (the difference between consecutive terms) by the term number, rather than understanding that the constant difference is added to the previous term a certain number of times to get to the desired term.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate term values in sequences, resulting in inaccurate results.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: A student is given the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ... and is asked to find the 10th term. They may incorrectly multiply the constant difference (3) by the term number (10) to get 30, rather than using the correct method to find the term value.

- Case 2: A student is asked to find the 5th term of the sequence 1, 4, 7, 10, ... . They may incorrectly multiply the constant difference (3) by the term number (5) to get 15, rather than finding the correct term value.

- Case 3: A student is given a sequence with a constant difference of 2 and is asked to find the 8th term. They may incorrectly multiply the constant difference (2) by the term number (8) to get 16, rather than using the correct method to find the term value."
2253,Believes the position number in a sequence does not have to be an integer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with sequences and they believe that the term number or position in a sequence can be a fraction or a decimal, rather than understanding that it must always be a whole number. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the concept of sequences and the role of the term number in defining the position of each term.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the nth term of a sequence, students may think that 'n' can be a fraction, such as finding the 3.5th term.
- When asked to identify a term in a sequence, students may give a term that corresponds to a non-integer position, such as saying the 2.5th term is a specific value.
- When working with real-life sequences, such as a pattern of shapes or colors, students may think that they can have a fraction of a shape or color, rather than understanding that each term must be a discrete unit.
- When solving problems involving sequences, students may not consider the restriction that the term number must be an integer, leading to incorrect solutions or answers."
2254,Removes the decimal point when asked to round a decimal to a whole number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to round a decimal number to the nearest whole number, but instead of properly rounding, they simply remove the decimal point. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of rounding, which involves looking at the digit after the decimal point to determine whether to round up or down. 

For example, when asked to round 4.7 to the nearest whole number, a student with this misconception may simply remove the decimal point and answer 47, instead of looking at the 7 and realizing that it is closer to 5 than 4. 

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Rounding 3.9 to the nearest whole number, where the student answers 39 instead of 4.
- Rounding 2.1 to the nearest whole number, where the student answers 21 instead of 2.
- Rounding 9.5 to the nearest whole number, where the student answers 95 instead of 10."
2255,Believes you subtract the number caught second from the estimated population to find the number marked first when using the capture-recapture method,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the capture-recapture method, which is used to estimate the population size of a particular species. They mistakenly believe that to find the number of individuals initially marked, they need to subtract the number of individuals caught in the second sample from the estimated population size. This misunderstanding leads to incorrect calculations and ultimately, an inaccurate estimation of the population size.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a capture-recapture problem and are asked to calculate the number of individuals initially marked. For example, if the estimated population size is 100 and 20 individuals were caught in the second sample, they may incorrectly subtract 20 from 100, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- When students are working with real-life data and are trying to apply the capture-recapture method to estimate the population size of a particular species. They may collect data on the number of individuals caught in the first and second samples but then incorrectly apply the formula, leading to inaccurate results.
- When students are comparing the results of different capture-recapture studies and are trying to understand the differences in population estimates. Their misconception may lead them to misinterpret the results and draw incorrect conclusions."
2256,Believes the constant in an expanded quadratic comes from adding the two numbers in the brackets,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to expanding quadratic expressions in the form of (x+a)(x+b). They may incorrectly believe that the constant term in the expanded expression is simply the sum of the two numbers 'a' and 'b' in the brackets, rather than understanding that it is actually the product of 'a' and 'b'. 

For example, when expanding (x+3)(x+4), students with this misconception may think that the constant term is 3+4=7, rather than correctly calculating it as 3*4=12.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- Expanding (x+2)(x+5) and thinking the constant term is 2+5=7 instead of 2*5=10.
- Expanding (x-3)(x-2) and thinking the constant term is -3-2=-5 instead of (-3)*(-2)=6.
- Expanding (x+1)(x+6) and thinking the constant term is 1+6=7 instead of 1*6=6."
2257,Believes you always reduce the numerator and denominator by 1 when writing the probability for a second pick without replacement on a tree diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with tree diagrams to calculate probabilities for events without replacement. They mistakenly believe that to account for the removal of an item from the sample space, they simply need to reduce both the numerator and the denominator by 1 for the second pick. This oversimplification fails to consider the actual impact of removing the item on the probability of subsequent events.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A student is using a tree diagram to find the probability of picking two red balls consecutively without replacement from a bag containing 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. They might incorrectly reduce the numerator and denominator by 1 for the second pick, without recalculating the actual probabilities.
- A student is calculating the probability of drawing two specific cards from a deck without replacement. They may mistakenly apply the ""reduce by 1"" rule, failing to account for the changed composition of the deck after the first draw.
- A student is working on a problem involving picking marbles from a bag without replacement, where the probability of the second pick depends on the outcome of the first pick. They might incorrectly apply the ""reduce by 1"" rule, rather than recalculating the probabilities based on the updated sample space."
2258,Believes when writing a number in standard form as an ordinary number you write any digits in the base (omitting the decimal point) and do not account for the power of 10,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting numbers from standard form (also known as scientific notation) to ordinary numbers. They mistakenly believe that they can simply omit the decimal point and write the digits in the base, without considering the power of 10. This means they fail to multiply or divide the base by the corresponding power of 10, resulting in an incorrect conversion.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Converting 4.2 x 10^3 to an ordinary number, a student with this misconception may write 42 instead of 4200.
- Converting 2.5 x 10^-2 to an ordinary number, a student with this misconception may write 25 instead of 0.025.
- Converting 9.8 x 10^5 to an ordinary number, a student with this misconception may write 98 instead of 980,000."
2259,Believes the mean is something divided by the sum of the categories given,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of calculating the mean. They believe that to find the mean, you need to divide a certain value by the number of categories or groups in the data, rather than the total number of data points. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the mean as a measure of central tendency, which is calculated by summing up all the values and dividing by the total number of values.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the mean of a set of data presented in a bar chart or histogram, they might divide the sum of the data by the number of bars or categories rather than the total number of data points.
- When dealing with grouped data, students may assume that the mean is calculated by dividing the sum of the data by the number of groups, rather than the total number of individual data points within those groups.
- In situations where students are presented with a word problem that involves finding the mean, they may misinterpret the question and divide the sum by the number of categories or groups mentioned in the problem rather than the actual number of data points."
2260,Identifies a multiple of a number but not a common multiple of a group of numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of finding multiples of a single number, but struggle to extend this understanding to find common multiples that are shared among multiple numbers. They may be able to list the multiples of individual numbers, but have difficulty identifying the least common multiple (LCM) that is a multiple of all the numbers in the group.

For example, when asked to find the common multiples of 4 and 6, a student with this misconception may list the multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, ...) and the multiples of 6 (6, 12, 18, 24, ...), but fail to recognize that 12 is the smallest common multiple of both numbers.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers.
- When adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators, requiring a common denominator.
- When solving problems involving periodic events or cycles, such as finding the next time two events will coincide.
- When working with real-world applications, such as scheduling or timetabling, where finding common multiples is essential."
2261,Believes if shapes have rotational symmetry they must have line symmetry,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that rotational symmetry implies the presence of line symmetry. They may think that if a shape looks the same after a certain rotation, it must also have a line of symmetry. This is not necessarily true, as some shapes can have rotational symmetry without having any lines of symmetry.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are working with shapes that have an odd number of sides, such as an equilateral triangle or a regular pentagon. These shapes have rotational symmetry, but students may incorrectly assume that they must also have line symmetry.
- When students are dealing with complex shapes, such as a swastika or a similar symbol, which have rotational symmetry but not line symmetry.
- When students are exploring real-life objects, such as a pinwheel or a fan, which exhibit rotational symmetry but may not have line symmetry.
- When students are creating their own designs or patterns, they may unintentionally create shapes with rotational symmetry but not line symmetry, leading to confusion and reinforcing the misconception."
2262,Gets order of ratio wrong,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of ratios and incorrectly state or write the relationship between two or more quantities. A ratio is a comparison of two or more numbers, and the order in which the numbers are written is crucial. For example, a ratio of 2:3 is not the same as 3:2. However, students with this misconception may mistakenly swap the numbers or write them in the wrong order.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations, interpretations, and conclusions in various mathematical contexts, including scaling, equivalent ratios, and proportions.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When writing equivalent ratios, a student might write 4:6 as 6:4.
- When scaling a recipe up or down, a student might mistakenly swap the ratio of ingredients, e.g., using 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 cups, and vice versa.
- When working with proportions, a student might incorrectly write a proportion as 3/4 = 4/3 instead of 3/4 = 6/8.
- When comparing the size of objects, a student might say that a ratio of 2:5 is the same as 5:2.
- When working with fractions, a student might mistakenly simplify a fraction by swapping the numerator and denominator."
2263,Does not understand the root power of 4,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to comprehend that the fourth root of a number is a value that, when raised to the power of 4, gives the original number. They may struggle to understand the concept of root powers, specifically the idea that the fourth root is the inverse operation of raising a number to the power of 4. This can lead to difficulties in simplifying expressions and solving equations that involve fourth roots.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When simplifying expressions such as ∜16, students may think it equals 2^2 instead of 2.
* When solving equations like x^4 = 81, students may struggle to find the value of x, which is the fourth root of 81 (∜81 = 3).
* When comparing the values of numbers with different powers, students may incorrectly rank them, such as thinking that 2^4 is less than 3^3.
* When solving problems that involve radical expressions, such as ∜(2^8), students may incorrectly simplify the expression, leading to an incorrect answer.
* When working with numbers that have a fourth root that is not a whole number, students may be unable to approximate or calculate the value, such as ∜10."
2264,"When subtracting a power of 10, subtracts from the wrong column","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing subtraction operations involving powers of 10. For example, when subtracting 100 from a number, they might subtract 100 from the ones column instead of the hundreds column. This indicates a lack of understanding of place value and how powers of 10 are represented in our number system.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Subtracting 10 from 45, where a student might subtract 10 from the ones column, resulting in 35, instead of correctly subtracting 10 from the tens column.
- Subtracting 100 from 945, where a student might subtract 100 from the ones column, resulting in 845, instead of correctly subtracting 100 from the hundreds column.
- Subtracting 1000 from 6543, where a student might subtract 1000 from the tens or ones column, resulting in an incorrect answer, instead of correctly subtracting 1000 from the thousands column."
2265,Thinks that probabilities of an event occurring or not occurring must be equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the probability of an event happening and the probability of it not happening are always equal, i.e., 50% or 0.5 each. They may think that if there are two possible outcomes (e.g., it either happens or it doesn't), then each outcome must have an equal chance of occurring.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* Coin toss: A student might think that if you flip a coin, the probability of heads is 50% and the probability of tails is 50%, which is correct. However, they might extend this thinking to other events where the probabilities are not equal.
* Weather forecasting: A student might believe that the probability of it raining tomorrow is 50% and the probability of it not raining is 50%, simply because there are two possible outcomes.
* Lottery draws: A student might think that if there are two possible outcomes (winning or not winning), the probability of winning is 50%, which is not the case in reality.
* Medical tests: A student might believe that if a medical test has two possible outcomes (positive or negative), the probability of a positive result is 50% and the probability of a negative result is 50%, regardless of the actual probabilities based on the test's accuracy and the patient's condition.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of probability, and it's essential to address it to ensure students understand probability concepts accurately."
2266,Believes angles around a point sum to 180,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the rule that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to the sum of angles around a point. They may think that the angles around a point, such as the angles formed by two or more intersecting lines, also add up to 180 degrees.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or calculating angles around a point in a 2D shape, such as angles formed by intersecting lines or angles in a polygon.
- When working with 3D shapes and trying to calculate the sum of angles around a vertex.
- When solving problems involving angles in real-world contexts, such as calculating the angles of a bike wheel or the angles of a robotic arm.
- When trying to apply the angle sum property of a triangle to other geometric shapes, such as quadrilaterals or polygons.
- When visualizing and calculating angles in diagrams or sketches, particularly if the angles are not clearly labeled or marked."
2267,Chooses an incorrect point on the object when describing a 90 or 270 degree rotation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to describe or visualize a rotation of an object by 90 or 270 degrees. They may choose an incorrect point on the object as the fixed point or center of rotation, leading to an incorrect description of the rotation.

For example, when asked to describe a 90-degree rotation of a square, a student might choose a vertex (corner) of the square as the fixed point, instead of the center of the square. This would result in an incorrect description of the rotation, as the square would not end up in the correct position.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When describing the rotation of a shape in a geometry problem, a student chooses a vertex instead of the center as the fixed point.
- When visualizing a rotation in a real-world context, such as a merry-go-round, a student assumes the rotation occurs around a point on the edge of the ride instead of the center.
- When solving a problem involving symmetry, a student chooses an incorrect point as the center of rotation, leading to incorrect conclusions about the symmetry of the shape.
- When working with rotations in a coordinate plane, a student chooses an incorrect point as the origin, resulting in incorrect coordinates for the rotated points."
2268,Thinks the x coordinate of a point on the y axis is 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of coordinate geometry and the relationship between the x and y axes. They may believe that any point on the y-axis has an x-coordinate of 1, rather than understanding that all points on the y-axis have an x-coordinate of 0. This misconception may stem from a lack of exposure to graphing or a misunderstanding of the concept of coordinates.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When asked to identify the coordinates of a point on the y-axis, the student consistently answers that the x-coordinate is 1.
* When graphing a point on the y-axis, the student labels the x-coordinate as 1 instead of 0.
* When solving problems involving coordinates, the student assumes that any point on the y-axis has an x-coordinate of 1, leading to incorrect calculations and answers."
2269,"When finding the distance between coordinates, includes the starting number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the distance between two points on a coordinate grid. They mistakenly believe that the starting coordinate value should be included in the calculation, rather than finding the difference between the two coordinates.

For example, given two points (3, 4) and (6, 8), students with this misconception might calculate the distance as: 
- Horizontal distance: 3 + 3 (instead of 6 - 3 = 3)
- Vertical distance: 4 + 4 (instead of 8 - 4 = 4)

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Finding the length of a line segment on a coordinate plane
- Calculating the distance between two points in a real-world context, like the distance between two landmarks on a map
- Determining the length of the sides of a shape on a coordinate grid
- Solving problems involving movement or travel between two points, where the distance needs to be calculated."
2270,"In a function machine, confuses an operation with the input","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the relationship between the input and the operations performed within a function machine. They may mistakenly believe that the operation itself is the input, rather than the value being operated on. For example, if a function machine is represented as ""add 3"" and the input is 5, students with this misconception may think that ""add 3"" is the input, rather than the operation being applied to the input of 5.

This misconception can lead to incorrect interpretations of function machines and algebraic expressions. Students may struggle to distinguish between the operation being performed and the input value, resulting in incorrect calculations and a lack of understanding of the underlying mathematical concept.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to create a function machine that adds 2 to an input, a student may write ""+2"" as the input, rather than recognizing that ""+2"" is the operation to be performed on the input.
* When given a function machine that multiplies an input by 4, a student may think that ""×4"" is the input, rather than the operation being applied to the input value.
* When working with algebraic expressions, a student may confuse the variable (input) with the operation being performed on that variable, leading to incorrect simplifications and solutions."
2271,"When solving a problem that requires an inverse operation (e.g. missing number problems), does the original operation","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are faced with a problem that involves an inverse operation, such as a missing number problem. They may mistakenly apply the original operation instead of its inverse. For example, if the problem states ""5 x ? = 15"", students may think that they need to multiply 5 by a number to get 15, rather than realizing that they need to divide 15 by 5 to find the missing number.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

* Missing number problems, like the example above (e.g. 5 x ? = 15, or 20 ÷ ? = 4)
* Word problems that involve inverse operations (e.g. ""Tom has 18 cookies to package in boxes of 3. How many boxes can he make?"")
* Simple algebraic equations (e.g. 2x = 10, where students may think they need to multiply 2 by a number to get 10)
* Real-world applications, such as calculating the cost of items (e.g. ""If a toy costs $15 and is on sale for 20% off, how much will you pay?"")"
2272,"When dividing involving a multiple of 10, gives an answer 10 times bigger than it should be ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers involving multiples of 10. They may incorrectly assume that the presence of a multiple of 10 in the dividend or divisor affects the magnitude of the quotient. As a result, they may multiply or divide the result by 10, leading to an answer that is 10 times bigger than the actual solution.

This misconception may be due to a misunderstanding of place value, where students may incorrectly apply the rule of multiplying or dividing by 10 when dealing with multiples of 10 in division problems. Additionally, it could be a result of overgeneralizing the rule of multiplying by 10 when dealing with multiples of 10 in multiplication problems.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: 100 ÷ 5 = ? (Student answers 200, instead of 20)
- Case 2: 50 ÷ 2 = ? (Student answers 500, instead of 25)
- Case 3: 400 ÷ 4 = ? (Student answers 4000, instead of 100)
- Case 4: 20 ÷ 2 = ? (Student answers 200, instead of 10)"
2273,Subtracts instead of divides,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly use subtraction instead of division to solve problems, often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the operations or the context of the problem. For example, when sharing a certain quantity into equal groups, students may subtract the number of groups from the total quantity instead of dividing the quantity by the number of groups.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When solving problems that involve sharing or grouping, like ""If I have 18 pencils and I want to put them into boxes of 3 pencils each, how many boxes can I make?"" A student with this misconception might subtract 3 from 18, resulting in an incorrect answer of 15.
- When dealing with measurement problems, like ""A bookshelf is 18 feet long, and I want to divide it into sections of 3 feet each. How many sections can I make?"" A student with this misconception might subtract 3 from 18, resulting in an incorrect answer of 15.
- In real-world scenarios, like baking cookies, a student might need to package 18 cookies into boxes of 3 cookies each. If they subtract instead of divide, they will end up with an incorrect number of boxes."
2274,"When dividing variables, thinks they subtract coefficients as well as powers","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing variables with coefficients and powers. They mistakenly believe that when dividing, they need to subtract not only the powers of the variables but also the coefficients. For example, when dividing 6x^4 by 2x^2, they might subtract the coefficients (6 - 2 = 4) and the powers (4 - 2 = 2), resulting in an incorrect answer of 4x^2.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Dividing 8x^3 by 2x, where they might think the answer is (8 - 2)x^(3 - 1) = 6x^2.
- Dividing 9y^2 by 3y, where they might think the answer is (9 - 3)y^(2 - 1) = 6y.
- Dividing 12z^5 by 4z^3, where they might think the answer is (12 - 4)z^(5 - 3) = 8z^2."
2275,Believes midpoint calculation is just half of the difference,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the midpoint between two numbers. They incorrectly assume that to find the midpoint, they only need to find half of the difference between the two numbers, without adding the result to the smaller number or taking into account the starting point. This error can lead to incorrect calculations and an incomplete understanding of the midpoint formula.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the midpoint of a line segment in geometry, a student may calculate half of the difference between the two endpoints but forget to add the result to the smaller endpoint, resulting in an incorrect midpoint.
- In statistics, a student may be asked to find the midpoint of a range of data, but they might only calculate half of the range without considering the starting value of the range.
- In a number sequence, a student might need to find the midpoint between two numbers, but they might only calculate half of the difference without adding it to the smaller number, leading to an incorrect answer."
2276,Has considered the percentage rather than the percentage of the amount,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly focus on the percentage value itself rather than the actual amount that percentage represents. They may treat the percentage as a fixed quantity, rather than understanding it as a proportion of the total amount. For instance, students may assume that a 10% increase on two different amounts will result in the same actual increase, without considering the original amounts.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Comparing discounts: A shirt is discounted by 20% in Store A and 15% in Store B. If the original price of the shirt is $100 in Store A and $200 in Store B, a student with this misconception may think the discount in Store A is better just because 20% is greater than 15%, without calculating the actual discount amount.

2. Interest rates: A student is comparing two savings accounts, one with a 5% interest rate and the other with a 3% interest rate. If the first account has a balance of $100 and the second account has a balance of $1,000, the student may mistakenly think the first account will earn more interest, solely based on the percentage, without considering the actual amount the percentage is applied to.

3. Increases in salary: An employee receives a 5% salary increase, but the student may assume the actual increase is the same for everyone, regardless of their original salary, not taking into account that a 5% increase on a higher salary results in a larger actual increase."
2277,"When factorising into double brackets, finds the correct values for the non variable terms but swops the plus and minus sign","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are factorising quadratic expressions into double brackets. They may correctly identify the values for the non-variable terms (i.e., the constant terms), but incorrectly arrange the signs within the brackets. Specifically, they may swap the plus and minus signs, leading to an incorrect factorisation. For example, when factorising the expression x^2 + 5x - 6, a student with this misconception may write (x + 6)(x - 1) instead of the correct factorisation (x + 6)(x - 1) or (x - 2)(x + 3).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Factorising the expression x^2 - 7x + 12, a student may write (x + 3)(x - 4) instead of (x - 3)(x - 4).
* Factorising the expression x^2 + 2x - 15, a student may write (x - 5)(x + 3) instead of (x + 5)(x - 3).
* Factorising the expression x^2 - 9x + 20, a student may write (x + 4)(x - 5) instead of (x - 4)(x - 5)."
2278,Subtracts rather than divides when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are faced with word problems that involve sharing or grouping objects, but instead of using division to find the solution, they incorrectly use subtraction. This is often due to a misunderstanding of the mathematical operation required by the problem's context. Students may be relying too heavily on the presence of certain keywords, such as ""take away"" or ""left,"" which they associate with subtraction, rather than considering the overall meaning of the problem.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: ""Tom has 18 pencils and wants to put them into boxes of 3 pencils each. How many boxes can Tom make?"" (Student may subtract 3 from 18 repeatedly until they get a small number, rather than dividing 18 by 3.)
- Case 2: ""A bookshelf has 12 books, and they need to be packed into bags of 4 books each. How many bags can be made?"" (Student may subtract 4 from 12, then again from the result, rather than dividing 12 by 4.)
- Case 3: ""A pizza has 16 slices, and Sara wants to share them equally among 4 of her friends. How many slices will each friend get?"" (Student may subtract 4 from 16 repeatedly, rather than dividing 16 by 4.)"
2279,Adds rather than multiplies when using the product rule for counting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with the product rule for counting, which is used to find the total number of outcomes in a situation where there are multiple events or choices. Instead of multiplying the number of options for each event, students with this misconception will add the number of options. This results in an incorrect calculation of the total number of possible outcomes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When calculating the total number of outfits that can be created with 3 shirts and 4 pants, a student with this misconception might say 3 + 4 = 7 outfits, instead of 3 x 4 = 12 outfits.
- When determining the number of possible meals that can be ordered from a menu with 5 choices for the main course and 3 choices for dessert, a student with this misconception might say 5 + 3 = 8 possible meals, instead of 5 x 3 = 15 possible meals.
- When finding the total number of ways to arrange 2 books on a shelf, with 5 choices for the first book and 4 choices for the second book, a student with this misconception might say 5 + 4 = 9 arrangements, instead of 5 x 4 = 20 arrangements."
2280,"Believes change in y for gradient is always calculated from the origin, regardless of the y-intercept of the line","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the change in y (the rise) for calculating the gradient of a line is always measured from the origin (0, 0), rather than between two points on the line itself. This means that they ignore the y-intercept and any translation of the line, resulting in incorrect calculations of the gradient.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate the gradient, especially when dealing with lines that do not pass through the origin. They may incorrectly assume that the y-intercept does not affect the calculation of the gradient.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the gradient of a line from a graph, a student measures the vertical distance from the x-axis (y = 0) rather than between two points on the line.
- When given the equation of a line in the form y = mx + c, a student calculates the gradient (m) by measuring the vertical distance from the origin to a point on the line, rather than using the equation or two points on the line.
- When comparing the gradients of two lines, a student incorrectly concludes that lines with different y-intercepts have different gradients, even if the lines are parallel."
2281,Does not understand which months are in the Spring,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify the correct months that fall within the Spring season. In the context of the Northern Hemisphere, Spring typically begins around March 20/21 (the vernal equinox) and ends around June 20/21. However, some students might mistakenly include months from adjacent seasons, such as February (Winter) or July (Summer), or they might altogether be unsure of which months constitute Spring.

This misconception can manifest in various scenarios, such as:

- Case 1: When creating a bar chart to display monthly rainfall in a Data and Statistics lesson, a student might incorrectly label the Spring months.
- Case 2: During a Geometry and Measure lesson, a student might be asked to calculate the number of days in Spring for a specific year, but they might choose the wrong months.
- Case 3: In an Algebra lesson, a student might be working on a problem that involves determining the number of weeks in Spring, but their misconception about the Spring months would lead to an incorrect solution.
- Case 4: In a Number lesson, a student might be asked to calculate the total number of days in a specific season, including Spring, but they would get the wrong answer due to their misunderstanding of the Spring months."
2282,"Believes that in y=mx+c, m is the y-intercept","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the value 'm' in the linear equation y = mx + c represents the point at which the line intersects the y-axis (y-intercept). They may have a misunderstanding of the roles of 'm' and 'c' in the equation. 'm' actually represents the slope or gradient of the line, indicating how steep the line is, while 'c' is the y-intercept. This misconception can lead to incorrect graphing, analysis, and interpretation of linear equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to graph a linear equation, a student might plot the y-intercept at the point (0, m) instead of (0, c).
- When given the equation y = 2x + 3, a student might say that the y-intercept is 2, instead of 3.
- When asked to write an equation for a line with a given y-intercept, a student might incorrectly use the y-intercept value as the slope (m) in the equation."
2283,"When finding the missing length on similar shapes, just finds the difference between the given lengths","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with similar shapes, which have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. When trying to find a missing length on one of the shapes, some students may simply subtract the given lengths of the corresponding sides of the two shapes to find the missing length. They fail to recognize that similar shapes are related by a scale factor, not a simple difference in lengths. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of similarity and scale factor in geometry.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When comparing the lengths of corresponding sides of two similar triangles, a student may find the difference between the two known lengths rather than using the ratio of the sides to find the missing length.
- When working with similar rectangles, a student may try to find the missing length of one rectangle by subtracting the length of the corresponding side of the other rectangle, rather than using the scale factor to set up a proportion.
- In a problem involving two similar shapes with multiple corresponding sides, a student may attempt to find the missing length by finding the difference between the given lengths of each pair of corresponding sides, rather than recognizing that the same scale factor applies to all corresponding sides."
2284,When asked for a specific term in a sequence just gives the next term,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a specific term in a sequence, but instead of using the given information or a formula to find the requested term, they simply provide the next term in the sequence. This shows a lack of understanding of how sequences work and how to access specific terms. 

For example, if a sequence is given as 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and a student is asked to find the 8th term, they might simply add the next number in the pattern (17) instead of finding the actual 8th term. 

This misconception can occur in various cases such as:

- When students are dealing with simple arithmetic sequences (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8,...) and are asked to find a term far into the sequence.
- When students are working with sequences that have a more complex pattern (e.g., 1, 2, 4, 7, 11,...) and struggle to find a specific term.
- When students are given a sequence with a given formula or rule and are asked to find a specific term, but ignore the formula and just give the next term."
2285,"In a function machine, confuses the first operation and the input","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the order of operations in a function machine. A function machine is a simple input-output device where an input value is transformed into an output value through a series of operations. In this misconception, students mistakenly think that the first operation is the input itself, rather than the process applied to the input. As a result, they may apply the wrong operation or apply it in the wrong order, leading to incorrect outputs.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A function machine with the rule ""add 3"" is applied to an input of 5. A student with this misconception may think that the ""add 3"" is the input, and the output would be 3, rather than applying the operation to the input 5, resulting in an output of 8.
2. A function machine with the rule ""multiply by 2"" and then ""add 1"" is applied to an input of 4. A student with this misconception may think that the ""multiply by 2"" is the input, and then apply the ""add 1"" operation, resulting in an output of 3, rather than applying the operations in the correct order, resulting in an output of 9.
3. A function machine with the rule ""subtract 2"" is applied to an input of 10. A student with this misconception may think that the ""subtract 2"" is the input, and the output would be -2, rather than applying the operation to the input 10, resulting in an output of 8."
2286,Believes the length of the line in a velocity time graph gives the distance (rather than the area underneath that line).,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret velocity-time graphs. They mistakenly think that the length of the line on the graph represents the distance traveled by an object, rather than understanding that the area under the line (or the integral of the velocity function) gives the actual distance traveled. This misconception is likely due to an incomplete understanding of the relationship between velocity and distance, as well as a lack of familiarity with interpreting graphs in a physics or mathematical context.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A student is given a velocity-time graph of a car traveling at a constant speed and is asked to find the distance traveled. They might simply measure the length of the line on the graph, rather than calculating the area under it.
2. When comparing the motion of two objects, a student might incorrectly conclude that the object with the longer line on the velocity-time graph traveled a greater distance, even if the area under the line is smaller.
3. A student is asked to find the distance traveled by an object that accelerates from rest to a certain speed. They might incorrectly use the length of the line on the graph, rather than calculating the area under the curve, which would give the correct distance traveled."
2287,Believes multiplying together all prime factors gives the highest common factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more numbers. They believe that by multiplying all the prime factors of the given numbers, they will obtain the HCF. However, this is incorrect because the HCF is the product of the common prime factors raised to the smallest power they appear in any of the numbers, not all prime factors. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify the HCF, especially when dealing with numbers that have multiple prime factors.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Finding the HCF of 12 (2^2 * 3) and 18 (2 * 3^2): Students may multiply all prime factors (2^2 * 3^2) to get 36, instead of finding the common prime factors (2 * 3) to get 6.
2. Finding the HCF of 24 (2^3 * 3) and 30 (2 * 3 * 5): Students may multiply all prime factors (2^3 * 3 * 5) to get 120, instead of finding the common prime factors (2 * 3) to get 6.
3. Finding the HCF of 48 (2^4 * 3) and 60 (2^2 * 3 * 5): Students may multiply all prime factors (2^4 * 3 * 5) to get 240, instead of finding the common prime factors (2^2 * 3) to get 12."
2288,"When multiplying decimals, does not realize that the order and position of the digits (relative to each other) has to remain constant.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of place value and the importance of maintaining the relative position of digits when multiplying decimals. They might treat decimal multiplication as simple multiplication of whole numbers, ignoring the fact that the placement of the decimal point and the digits' positions are crucial. This can lead to incorrect alignment of digits and, ultimately, an incorrect product.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Multiplying 4.2 by 3, a student may incorrectly calculate 42 x 3 = 126 and then randomly place the decimal point, rather than correctly calculating 4.2 x 3 = 12.6.

2. When multiplying 0.45 by 9, a student might calculate 45 x 9 = 405 and fail to adjust for the decimal point, resulting in an incorrect answer of 405 instead of 4.05.

3. In the case of multiplying 2.5 by 0.6, a student may ignore the position of the decimal points and calculate 25 x 6 = 150, instead of correctly calculating 2.5 x 0.6 = 1.5."
2289,Confuses the signs for straight lines as being dashes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the symbol for a straight line is a dash (-) rather than an actual straight line. They might see the dash symbol used in other contexts, such as indicating a break or separation, and incorrectly assume it represents a straight line in geometry. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to draw or identify different types of lines, such as straight lines, curved lines, or zigzag lines, and they consistently use dashes to represent straight lines.
- When students are working with geometric shapes and incorrectly use dashes to indicate the edges or sides of the shapes.
- When students are asked to describe or label the features of a diagram, such as a map or a graph, and they mistakenly use dashes to indicate straight lines or boundaries."
2290,Uses the same value for both coordinates,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the x and y coordinates of a point on a graph are the same value. This can happen when students are not fully understanding the concept of coordinates and how they are represented on a graph. For example, if a point is supposed to be (3, 5), a student with this misconception may write it as (3, 3) or (5, 5), using the same value for both the x and y coordinates.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When plotting points on a graph, a student may use the same value for both coordinates, resulting in incorrect placement of the point.
- When reading coordinates from a graph, a student may assume that the x and y coordinates are the same value, leading to incorrect interpretation of the data.
- When working with real-world applications, such as mapping or navigation, using the same value for both coordinates can result in incorrect locations or directions.

Cases:

- A student is asked to plot the point (2, 4) on a graph, but instead plots the point (2, 2).
- A student is given the coordinates of a location as (5, 3), but writes it as (5, 5) when recording it.
- A student is asked to find the coordinates of a point on a graph, and assumes that the x and y coordinates are the same value, resulting in an incorrect answer."
2291,"When solving simultaneous equations, thinks they can't multiply each equation by a different number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to solving simultaneous equations using the method of elimination. They may assume that in order to keep the equations equivalent, the same operation must be applied to both equations. They may believe that multiplying each equation by a different number will change the solution set, making it impossible to find the correct values of the variables. As a result, they may try to find alternative methods or become stuck, unable to proceed with solving the equations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When the coefficients of the variables in the two equations are different and students need to multiply each equation by a different number to make the coefficients of one variable the same.
- When the equations contain fractions or decimals, and students need to multiply each equation by a different number to clear the fractions or decimals.
- When the equations are more complex, involving multiple variables or non-linear terms, and students need to multiply each equation by a different number to simplify the equations and make them easier to solve.
- When students are working with word problems that involve simultaneous equations, and they need to multiply each equation by a different number to represent the problem accurately."
2292,Does not understand that factors are divisors which split the number into equal groups,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that factors are numbers that divide a given number exactly without leaving a remainder, resulting in equal groups or sets. They may think that factors are simply numbers that can be multiplied together to get the original number, without understanding the concept of equal grouping or division. 

For example, when asked to find the factors of 12, a student with this misconception might not understand why 3 is a factor (because 12 can be divided into 4 groups of 3: 3, 3, 3, 3) and might only focus on the multiplication aspect (3 x 4 = 12). 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When listing factors of a number, the student only focuses on the multiplication aspect and not the division aspect.
- When solving problems that involve sharing or grouping objects, the student fails to recognize that factors can help find the number of groups or the number of objects in each group.
- When working with real-world problems, such as arranging items in rows or groups, the student fails to apply the concept of factors to find the most efficient arrangement."
2293,Thinks the orientation of the side view does not matter when identifying the direction of view,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with 3D objects and trying to visualize or draw their 2D representations from different viewpoints. They might believe that regardless of how they orientate the side view, the direction of view (e.g., from the front, side, or top) remains the same. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect interpretations or drawings of 3D objects in various contexts, such as architecture, engineering, or design.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When drawing the side view of a 3D object, a student might not consider the orientation of the object relative to the viewer's perspective, resulting in an incorrect representation of the object's features.
- Case 2: When interpreting a 2D drawing of a 3D object, a student might assume that the direction of view is the same regardless of the orientation of the side view, leading to misunderstandings about the object's actual shape or layout.
- Case 3: When working with isometric drawings or other forms of technical drawing, a student might neglect to account for the orientation of the side view, resulting in errors when trying to visualize or construct the 3D object."
2294,Believes that Mid point multiplied by the Frequency in a grouped frequency table gives the frequency for that group.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding the total value or the sum of the values for a particular group in a grouped frequency table. They mistakenly believe that by multiplying the midpoint of the group by the frequency, they will obtain the frequency for that group, rather than the total value. This error stems from a lack of understanding of the purpose of the midpoint in a grouped frequency table, which is to provide a representative value for the group, allowing for calculations such as the mean or total value.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When finding the mean from a grouped frequency table, a student might multiply the midpoint by the frequency and state that the result is the new frequency.
- When calculating the total value for a group, a student might multiply the midpoint by the frequency and incorrectly label the result as the frequency.
- When comparing the frequencies of different groups, a student might multiply the midpoints by the frequencies and incorrectly conclude that the results represent the frequencies of the groups."
2295,Believes probabilities can be greater than 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the fundamental concept of probability, which is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. They may believe that an event can have a probability greater than 1, indicating a greater than 100% chance of it happening. This misunderstanding may stem from a lack of comprehension of the probability scale, where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. Students may also confuse probability with other concepts, such as frequency or proportion, leading them to incorrectly assign probabilities greater than 1.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When calculating the probability of multiple events occurring, students may incorrectly add the probabilities together, resulting in a probability greater than 1.
- When interpreting data, students may misread or misinterpret the scale of a graph or chart, leading them to believe that an event has a probability greater than 1.
- When solving problems involving conditional probability, students may fail to account for the conditions, resulting in an incorrect probability calculation that exceeds 1.
- When dealing with theoretical probabilities, students may mistakenly assign a probability greater than 1 to an event that they believe is ""almost certain"" to happen.
- When working with decimals or fractions, students may incorrectly calculate or convert probabilities, leading to values greater than 1."
2296,Believes Fibonacci numbers are triangle numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that Fibonacci numbers and triangular numbers are the same sequence of numbers. Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...), while triangular numbers are the sums of consecutive natural numbers (1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...). Students may confuse these two sequences because both sequences appear to be increasing and related to addition, but they have different underlying structures and formulas.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When students are asked to identify or generate a sequence of numbers and mistakenly produce a sequence that resembles the Fibonacci sequence but actually represents triangular numbers, or vice versa.
2. When students are solving problems that involve the use of sequences or patterns, such as those found in algebra or geometry, and incorrectly apply the properties of one sequence to the other.
3. When students are analyzing real-world examples, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the branching of trees, and misinterpret the underlying mathematical structure as being related to triangular numbers instead of Fibonacci numbers."
2297,Believes total frequency in a table is found by counting rows,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the total frequency in a table can be found by simply counting the number of rows in the table. They may overlook the fact that each row can have a different frequency value associated with it, and that the total frequency is actually the sum of these individual frequencies. This misconception can occur when students are working with data presented in tables, such as frequency tables or charts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* A student is given a table showing the favorite colors of a group of students, with each color listed in a separate row. The student counts the number of rows (e.g. 5 rows for 5 different colors) and assumes that the total frequency is 5, without considering the actual number of students who chose each color.
* A student is working with a table showing the frequency of different types of pets owned by a group of people. The table has 3 rows for dogs, cats, and other pets, but the student assumes the total frequency is 3, without adding up the actual frequencies listed in each row.
* A student is given a table showing the frequency of different scores on a test, with each score range listed in a separate row. The student counts the number of rows (e.g. 4 rows for 4 different score ranges) and assumes that the total frequency is 4, without considering the actual number of students who scored within each range."
2298,Mixes up smallest and greatest when ordering positive integers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the concept of ordering numbers, specifically when comparing the magnitude of positive integers. They may mistakenly identify the smallest number as the greatest or vice versa. This could be due to a lack of understanding of number lines, comparison of digits, or simply a misunderstanding of the terms ""smallest"" and ""greatest"".

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When comparing two numbers, such as 5 and 10, the student may incorrectly state that 5 is greater than 10.
- When ordering a set of numbers, such as 3, 1, 9, and 7, the student may incorrectly arrange them as 9, 7, 1, 3, instead of the correct order 1, 3, 7, 9.
- When identifying the smallest or greatest number in a set, such as 2, 8, 4, and 6, the student may incorrectly identify 8 as the smallest number or 2 as the greatest number."
2299,Believes any sample gives an equal chance of selection,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any sample taken from a population will automatically give an equal chance of selection to all members of that population. They may overlook the importance of sampling methods, such as random sampling, and assume that any sample is representative of the population. This misconception can lead to inaccurate conclusions and generalizations about the population.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student collects data from a group of friends to determine the favorite sports team in the school, assuming that the results will be representative of the entire school.
- Case 2: A student takes a sample of plants from a garden by selecting the first 10 plants they see, assuming that this sample will give an equal chance of selection to all plants in the garden.
- Case 3: A student conducts a survey by asking people in their neighborhood about their favorite food, assuming that the results will be representative of the entire city."
2300,Forgets to include a marked right angle when performing angle calculations,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overlook the importance of right angles in geometric shapes, particularly in trigonometry and angle calculations. A right angle is a crucial reference point for many angle relationships, such as complementary, supplementary, and corresponding angles. When students forget to include a marked right angle, they may incorrectly apply angle theorems or formulas, leading to inaccurate calculations.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. Calculating the length of a shadow using trigonometric ratios in a right-angled triangle.
2. Determining the size of an angle in a triangle using the angle sum property.
3. Finding the length of a side in a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.
4. Identifying corresponding angles in a diagram with multiple intersecting lines.
5. Solving problems involving the angle properties of isosceles or equilateral triangles."
2301,"Believes the equation of a horizontal line is in the form x = ay, where a is the y intercept","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between the equation of a line and its graphical representation. They may have learned that the equation of a line can be represented in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. However, when it comes to horizontal lines, which have a slope of zero, students may incorrectly assume that the equation should be in the form x = ay, where a is the y-intercept.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When graphing horizontal lines and determining their equations, students may mistakenly write the equation as x = ay instead of y = a.
* When solving problems involving horizontal lines, such as finding the equation of a line that passes through a given point, students may incorrectly apply the x = ay formula.
* When analyzing the equation of a horizontal line, students may misinterpret the role of the variable x and the constant a, leading to incorrect conclusions about the line's properties."
2302,Believes lines inside the shape are included when finding perimeter,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly include the lengths of internal lines or features within a shape when calculating its perimeter. They may incorrectly add the lengths of diagonals, medians, or other internal segments to the lengths of the sides, resulting in an incorrect perimeter. This misunderstanding can stem from a lack of clarity on what constitutes the perimeter of a shape, which is the total distance around the outside of the shape.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the perimeter of a shape with internal lines or features, such as a triangle with a median or altitude drawn.
- When calculating the perimeter of a composite shape, such as a rectangle with internal dividers or partitions.
- When dealing with irregular shapes that have internal lines or segments.
- When working with real-world applications, such as finding the perimeter of a room with internal walls or partitions."
2303,"When asked to find data points below a certain value, gives the number of data points above this value","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of data analysis, particularly when dealing with inequalities or comparisons. They might interpret the question as asking for the opposite of what is actually required. In this case, when asked to find the number of data points below a certain value, the student incorrectly provides the number of data points above that value, essentially flipping the inequality.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

* Case 1: In a set of exam scores, a student is asked to find the number of students who scored below 50. However, they mistakenly give the number of students who scored above 50.
* Case 2: When analyzing a dataset of temperatures, a student is asked to find the number of days with temperatures below 20°C. Instead, they provide the number of days with temperatures above 20°C.
* Case 3: In a survey, a student is asked to find the number of people who earn less than $500 per week. However, they incorrectly give the number of people who earn more than $500 per week."
2304,"Believes that Mid-point x Frequency in a grouped frequency table gives an accurate total, rather than an estimate.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that using the midpoint of a class interval in a grouped frequency table and multiplying it by the frequency of that class will give an exact total, rather than an estimate. They may think that this method provides a precise calculation, rather than an approximation. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the mean of a grouped frequency table, a student may use the midpoint x frequency method and claim that the result is the exact total or mean, rather than acknowledging that it's an estimate.
- When comparing the totals or means calculated using the midpoint x frequency method with the actual totals or means calculated using the raw data, a student may be surprised or confused by the differences, not realizing that the midpoint x frequency method is meant to provide an estimate.
- When working with grouped frequency tables that have large class intervals or unevenly distributed data, a student may not recognize that the midpoint x frequency method becomes less accurate, leading to a greater discrepancy between the estimated and actual totals or means."
2305,Ignores place value when adding a whole number and a decimal,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students treat whole numbers and decimals as separate entities, failing to consider the place value of each digit. When adding a whole number and a decimal, they may simply append the decimal to the whole number, ignoring the place value alignment. For example, when adding 5 (whole number) and 0.3 (decimal), students with this misconception may write the answer as 50.3 instead of aligning the place values correctly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Adding 4 + 0.25, where students may write 40.25 instead of 4.25.
- Adding 10 + 0.5, where students may write 100.5 instead of 10.5.
- Adding 3 + 0.9, where students may write 30.9 instead of 3.9.
- Adding 2 + 0.11, where students may write 20.11 instead of 2.11.
- Adding 15 + 0.7, where students may write 150.7 instead of 15.7."
2306,"Applies BIDMAS in strict order (does not realize addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division, are of equal priority)","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the BIDMAS (Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction) rule as a strict sequential order for operations. They fail to understand that the rule actually groups operations into pairs of equal priority: addition and subtraction, and multiplication and division. 

When presented with expressions containing multiple operations at the same level (e.g., both addition and subtraction, or both multiplication and division), students with this misconception may incorrectly perform the operations in a strict order, rather than working from left to right within each pair of operations.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

1. Evaluating the expression: 8 - 3 + 2. Students may perform the addition before the subtraction, resulting in an incorrect answer.
2. Simplifying the expression: 12 ÷ 3 × 4. Students may perform the division before considering the multiplication, without working from left to right.
3. Solving the expression: 9 + 5 - 2. Students may add 9 and 5 first, then subtract 2, without realizing that addition and subtraction should be performed in the order they appear from left to right.
4. Evaluating the expression: 6 × 2 ÷ 3. Students may multiply 6 and 2, then divide the result by 3, without considering the equal priority of multiplication and division."
2307,Thinks you can divide the variables and the numerical values by different numbers when simplifying an algebraic fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying algebraic fractions and they incorrectly believe that they can divide the variables and numerical values by different numbers. They may think that the variables and constants in an algebraic fraction can be treated separately, allowing them to simplify the fraction by dividing the variables by one number and the numerical values by another.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying a fraction like (6x) / (2y), a student may incorrectly simplify it to 3x / y by dividing the numerical value 6 by 2, but then not dividing the variable x by 2, or not dividing both the 6 and the x by the same number.
- When simplifying a fraction like (8x^2) / (4x), a student may incorrectly simplify it to 2x^2 / x by dividing the numerical value 8 by 4, but not dividing the variable x^2 by x.
- When simplifying a fraction like (12xy) / (3x), a student may incorrectly simplify it to 4y / x by dividing the numerical value 12 by 3, but not dividing the variable xy by x."
2308,Converts a fraction to a decimal by placing a decimal point between the numerator and denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of converting a fraction to a decimal. They mistakenly believe that simply placing a decimal point between the numerator and the denominator will result in the correct decimal equivalent of the fraction. For instance, they might think that 3/4 can be converted to a decimal by writing 3.4, or that 1/2 can be converted to 1.2.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When students are asked to convert simple fractions like 1/2 or 3/4 to decimals, they might write 1.2 or 3.4, respectively.
- When working with mixed numbers, students might incorrectly convert 2 3/4 to 2.3.4.
- In word problems, students might be asked to find the decimal equivalent of a fraction, such as ""A recipe calls for 3/4 cup of flour. What is this in decimal form?"" and they might respond with 3.4 cups.
- When comparing fractions, students might incorrectly convert both fractions to decimals using this method and then compare the results. For example, when comparing 1/2 and 2/3, they might write 1.2 and 2.3, respectively, and conclude that 2/3 is larger."
2309,Thinks they can just give the probability of the first event for a combined probability,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the probability of two or more events happening together, and they mistakenly believe that they can simply give the probability of the first event as the answer. They may not fully understand that combined probabilities involve the interaction between multiple events and that the probabilities of each event need to be considered together.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the probability of two independent events happening together, such as flipping two coins and getting heads on both.
- When finding the probability of two dependent events happening together, such as drawing two cards from a deck without replacement.
- When solving problems involving ""and"" or ""or"" conditions, such as ""What is the probability that it will rain and the bus will be late?""
- When using probability trees or diagrams to find combined probabilities, but only considering the probability of the first event.
- When solving real-world problems, such as predicting the probability of two teams winning in a tournament, and assuming the probability of the first team winning is the same as the combined probability of both teams winning."
2310,Does not know how to find the gradient of a straight line from two points,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unsure of how to calculate the gradient (also known as slope) of a straight line given two points on the line. The students may struggle to apply the formula for finding the gradient, which involves subtracting the y-coordinates and x-coordinates of the two points and then dividing the difference in y-coordinates by the difference in x-coordinates. They may also get confused with the order of subtraction, leading to incorrect signs or incorrect values.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When finding the equation of a straight line passing through two given points, where the gradient is a crucial component of the equation.
- When graphing a straight line and needing to determine its steepness or direction, which is represented by the gradient.
- When solving problems involving the motion of objects, where the gradient of a line represents the rate of change of distance or velocity over time.
- When analyzing data in a scatter plot and trying to determine the relationship between two variables, where the gradient of the line of best fit represents the rate of change of one variable with respect to the other.
- When working with real-world applications, such as the slope of a roof or the gradient of a road, where the gradient is essential for design and construction purposes."
2311,Divides rather than adds when answering worded problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misinterpret the language used in word problems, particularly those involving addition, and instead use division to solve the problem. Students may misunderstand the context of the problem, keywords, or phrases that indicate the need for addition, leading them to incorrectly apply division. This misconception can stem from a lack of understanding of mathematical vocabulary, insufficient practice with word problems, or difficulty in translating real-world scenarios into mathematical operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: ""Tom has 15 pencils in his pencil case. His friend gives him 5 more pencils. How many pencils does Tom have now?"" A student with this misconception may divide 15 by 5 instead of adding 5 to 15.

- Case 2: ""A bookshelf has 12 books on it. If 7 more books are added, how many books are on the bookshelf now?"" A student may incorrectly divide 12 by 7 instead of adding 7 to 12.

- Case 3: ""A bakery has 18 cupcakes on display. They receive a new batch of 9 cupcakes. How many cupcakes does the bakery have now?"" A student with this misconception may divide 18 by 9 instead of adding 9 to 18."
2312,Thinks congruent shapes are the same shape but can be different sizes,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand that congruent shapes must be the same shape, but mistakenly believe that the sizes can be different. They might think that as long as the shapes have the same number of sides, angles, or proportions, they can be considered congruent, even if one shape is larger or smaller than the other.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When comparing two similar-looking shapes, one being a scaled-up or scaled-down version of the other.
- When students are asked to identify congruent shapes in a set of similar shapes with varying sizes.
- When working with real-life objects, such as two boxes or containers with the same shape but different sizes, and assuming they are congruent.
- When students are given a set of shapes and asked to group them based on congruence, mistakenly grouping similar shapes of different sizes together.
- When solving problems involving congruent shapes in geometry and measurement, such as calculating perimeters or areas of shapes, and assuming that size does not matter."
2313,Mixes up discrete and continuous data types,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to distinguish between discrete and continuous data types. Discrete data refers to countable values that can only take on specific, distinct values (e.g., number of books, number of siblings), whereas continuous data can take on any value within a range (e.g., height, weight, temperature). 

Students with this misconception may treat discrete data as if it were continuous or vice versa. For example, they might try to calculate the mean of a set of categorical data or assume that a continuous variable can only take on specific, discrete values.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Trying to calculate the mean of the number of pets students have, without realizing that the number of pets is a discrete variable.
- Assuming that the height of students in a class can only be measured in whole numbers (e.g., 160 cm, 170 cm), rather than recognizing that height is a continuous variable that can be measured to a more precise level (e.g., 162.5 cm).
- Creating histograms or graphs with discrete data, but treating the data as if it were continuous by drawing a continuous curve through the data points.
- Incorrectly applying statistical methods or formulas that are suitable for one type of data to the other type."
2314,Multiplies instead of divides to find one part given the total,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find one part of a whole, they need to multiply the total by the number of parts, rather than dividing the total by the number of parts. This shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between multiplication and division, as well as the concept of equal sharing or grouping.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: If Sally has 18 cookies that she wants to put into boxes of 3 cookies each, a student with this misconception might multiply 18 by 3 to find the number of cookies in one box, instead of dividing 18 by 3.
- Case 2: If a bookshelf has 24 books to be packed into boxes that hold 4 books each, a student with this misconception might multiply 24 by 4 to find the number of books in one box, instead of dividing 24 by 4.
- Case 3: If a pizza has 16 slices to be shared equally among 4 people, a student with this misconception might multiply 16 by 4 to find the number of slices one person gets, instead of dividing 16 by 4."
2315,Confuses negative and positive correlation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify a negative correlation as a positive one or vice versa. In data analysis, correlation refers to the relationship between two variables. A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase. On the other hand, a negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease.

Students with this misconception may misinterpret data and come to incorrect conclusions. For example, if data shows that as the amount of exercise increases, the risk of heart disease decreases, a student with this misconception may think that the data shows a positive correlation between exercise and heart disease risk, when in fact it shows a negative correlation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Analyzing the relationship between the amount of rainfall and the number of people visiting a beach. A student with this misconception may think that a decrease in beach attendance as rainfall increases is a positive correlation.
- Case 2: Examining the relationship between hours spent watching TV and academic achievement. A student with this misconception may believe that an increase in TV time leading to a decrease in academic achievement is a positive correlation.
- Case 3: Investigating the relationship between temperature and energy consumption. A student with this misconception may think that an increase in energy consumption as temperature decreases is a positive correlation."
2316,Mixes up squaring and multiplying by 2 or doubling,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number means multiplying it by 2 or doubling it, rather than multiplying the number by itself. For example, they may think that 4 squared (4²) is equal to 4 x 2 = 8, rather than 4 x 4 = 16.

This misconception can lead to errors in various mathematical operations, such as:

- Simplifying algebraic expressions: Students may incorrectly simplify expressions like x² as 2x, rather than x multiplied by x.
- Solving equations: Students may incorrectly solve equations like x² = 9 as x = 18 (i.e., 9 x 2), rather than x = 3 or x = -3.
- Calculating areas: Students may incorrectly calculate the area of a square with a side length of 5 units as 5 x 2 = 10 square units, rather than 5 x 5 = 25 square units.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Simplifying expressions like 2x² or (2x)²
- Solving equations like x² = 4 or x² = 16
- Calculating areas or volumes of shapes, such as squares, rectangles, or cubes."
2317,"When asked for the next term in the sequence subtracts one from the last term given, despite the sequence not going down in ones.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are given a sequence of numbers and are asked to identify the next term. Instead of analyzing the pattern of the sequence, they simply subtract one from the last term given, assuming that the sequence decreases by one each time. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of pattern recognition and the ability to identify relationships between numbers in a sequence.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When given a sequence like 25, 22, 19, 16, and asked to find the next term, the student might answer 15, assuming a decrease of one from the difference between consecutive terms.
- When given a sequence like 10, 8, 6, 4, and asked to find the next term, the student might answer 3, which is correct in this case, but for the wrong reason. They might think that subtracting one from the last term is the correct method, rather than recognizing the pattern of decreasing by 2 each time.
- When given a sequence like 100, 90, 80, 70, and asked to find the next term, the student might answer 69, instead of recognizing the pattern of decreasing by 10 each time."
2318,Has used the wrong data point on the graph,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly identify or use a data point on a graph, leading to incorrect conclusions or calculations. This can happen when students misread the coordinates of a point, confuse the x and y axes, or misinterpret the scale of the graph. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading values from a line graph, a student might mistakenly look at the wrong intersection point on the grid lines, leading to an incorrect data point.
- In a bar chart, a student might confuse the height of the bars with the values on the x-axis, resulting in incorrect data point identification.
- When analyzing a scatter plot, a student might misinterpret the correlation between variables due to using incorrect data points.
- In a multi-line graph, a student might mistakenly follow the wrong line, leading to incorrect data point identification.
- When working with a graph that has a non-standard scale (e.g., a logarithmic scale), a student might misinterpret the data points due to unfamiliarity with the scale."
2319,subtracts the highest from the lowest when calculating the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the range of a set of data, they need to subtract the highest value from the lowest value, but they get the order of subtraction wrong. Instead of subtracting the lowest value from the highest value, they subtract the highest value from the lowest value, resulting in a negative range or an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the range of a set of exam scores, a student subtracts the highest score (e.g., 90) from the lowest score (e.g., 40), getting -50 instead of the correct range of 50.
- In a dataset of temperatures, a student subtracts the highest temperature (e.g., 25°C) from the lowest temperature (e.g., 10°C), resulting in -15°C instead of the correct range of 15°C.
- When analyzing the range of heights in a class, a student subtracts the highest height (e.g., 180 cm) from the lowest height (e.g., 150 cm), getting -30 cm instead of the correct range of 30 cm."
2320,Subtracts rather than divides when scaling down in direct proportion problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with direct proportion problems that involve scaling down. In such problems, the value of one quantity decreases as the other quantity decreases, while maintaining a constant ratio between the two. Students with this misconception tend to subtract a fixed amount from the original value instead of dividing it by a scaling factor, which would actually be the correct operation to maintain the proportion.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- A recipe for 8 people requires 400g of flour. If the recipe is to be scaled down for 2 people, a student with this misconception might subtract 300g (or some other incorrect amount) from 400g, instead of dividing 400g by 4 to maintain the proportion.
- A model car is 20cm long and represents a real car that is 4m long. If a student is asked to find the length of a model car that represents a 1m long real car, they might subtract 15cm (or some other incorrect amount) from 20cm, instead of dividing 20cm by 4 to maintain the proportion.
- A group of friends want to share some sweets in the ratio of 3:4. If they have 21 sweets and want to scale down the ratio to 3:4 for 3 people, a student with this misconception might subtract a fixed amount from 21, instead of dividing it by a scaling factor to maintain the proportion."
2321,does not know the meaning of the word digit,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unclear about the basic terminology used in mathematics, specifically the word ""digit"". They may confuse it with the concept of numbers or numerals. A digit refers to a single symbol used to represent a value in the decimal system, such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. This lack of understanding can lead to confusion when working with numbers, particularly in tasks that involve counting, comparing, or manipulating digits.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify the number of digits in a given number, a student with this misconception might count the total value of the number instead of the individual digits. For example, when asked how many digits are in the number 123, they might say ""one hundred and twenty-three"" instead of ""three"".
2. When performing arithmetic operations, a student with this misconception might misunderstand the concept of ""carrying over"" or ""regrouping"" digits, leading to incorrect calculations.
3. When completing tasks that involve counting or comparing digits, such as identifying the largest or smallest digit in a set of numbers, a student with this misconception might become confused and struggle to complete the task accurately."
2322,Believes a percentage of a number will be a multiple of the percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that finding a percentage of a number involves simply multiplying the percentage value by an integer, rather than understanding that percentages represent proportions of the original number. They may incorrectly believe that the result of finding a percentage of a number will always be a whole number multiple of the percentage.

For example, when asked to find 25% of 17, a student with this misconception may respond with 25 or 50 (multiples of 25), rather than the correct answer, which is 4.25.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Calculating discounts on items, e.g., 15% off a £23 item
- Determining the percentage of students who achieved a certain grade in a class
- Finding the interest earned on a savings account with a percentage interest rate."
2323,"When ordering decimals, believes the decimal point is not relevant","Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the significance of the decimal point in decimal numbers. They may treat decimal numbers as whole numbers and compare the digits without considering the decimal point's placement. This can lead to incorrect ordering of decimals, as students may focus solely on the digits before or after the decimal point, rather than considering the entire number.

For example, when comparing 0.8 and 0.12, a student with this misconception might say 0.12 is greater than 0.8 because 12 is greater than 8. Similarly, when comparing 1.5 and 1.25, they might believe 1.25 is greater because 25 is greater than 5.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- Comparing the cost of items in a shop (e.g., £0.80 vs £0.12)
- Measuring ingredients for a recipe (e.g., 0.8 cups vs 0.12 cups)
- Recording data in a science experiment (e.g., 1.5 cm vs 1.25 cm)
- Solving math problems involving decimal numbers (e.g., ordering a set of decimal numbers from smallest to largest)"
2324,Believes the y-intercept of a line is the root of its equation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the y-intercept and its relationship with the roots of a linear equation. The y-intercept is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis, and its value is the constant term in the equation of the line. However, the root of an equation is the value of the variable (usually x) that makes the equation equal to zero. Students may mistakenly think that the y-intercept is the root because it is the point where the line intersects the y-axis, which can be perceived as the point where the equation ""starts"" or ""equals zero"".

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When graphing linear equations, students may label the y-intercept as the ""root"" of the equation.
- When solving linear equations, students may set the y-intercept equal to zero and solve for x, expecting to find the root of the equation.
- When analyzing the equation of a line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + b), students may incorrectly identify the constant term (b) as the root of the equation.
- When working with quadratic equations, students may mistakenly identify the y-intercept of the parabola as one of its roots."
2325,Believes data implies equal chance of selection,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that just because they are collecting data, every data point or option has an equal chance of being selected or occurring. They fail to consider that some data points may be more likely to occur than others due to various factors, such as bias, uneven distribution, or external influences. This misconception can lead to incorrect conclusions and interpretations of data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student conducts a survey to find the favorite color of students in their class and assumes that every color has an equal chance of being selected, without considering that some colors might be more popular due to current trends or cultural influences.

- Case 2: A student flips a coin and assumes that heads and tails have an equal chance of occurring, but fails to consider that the coin might be biased or that the flipping technique could affect the outcome.

- Case 3: A student analyzes the number of students who prefer different types of music and assumes that each genre has an equal chance of being selected, without considering that some genres might be more popular due to age or cultural factors.

- Case 4: A student collects data on the number of sunny and rainy days in a month and assumes that each type of weather has an equal chance of occurring, without considering that the time of year, location, or climate might affect the likelihood of each type of weather."
2326,Multiplies rather than adds ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they need to multiply numbers instead of adding them, often due to a misunderstanding of the mathematical operation required in a given problem. This can be a result of misinterpreting the language or context of the problem, or due to a lack of understanding of the mathematical concept being applied.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When solving problems involving time, students may multiply hours and minutes instead of adding them. For example, if a task takes 2 hours and 30 minutes, they may calculate the total time as 2 x 30 = 60 minutes instead of 2 hours + 30 minutes = 2 hours 30 minutes.
- When calculating the total cost of items, students may multiply the cost of each item instead of adding them. For example, if a book costs $5 and a pen costs $2, they may calculate the total cost as $5 x $2 = $10 instead of $5 + $2 = $7.
- When solving problems involving measurements, students may multiply lengths instead of adding them. For example, if a room is 5 meters long and 2 meters are added to it, they may calculate the new length as 5 x 2 = 10 meters instead of 5 + 2 = 7 meters.

These are just a few examples of how the misconception of multiplying instead of adding can occur."
2327,Does not understand that a space can be used to separate the thousands column from the hundreds column,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not familiar with the standard convention of using spaces or commas to separate large numbers into groups of three digits for easier reading and understanding. As a result, they may interpret a number like 1 234 as two separate numbers (1 and 234) rather than a single number (1234) with the space serving as a thousands separator.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When reading large numbers in word problems or real-life contexts, such as ""The population of the city is 1 500 000"" and the student interprets it as separate numbers.
- When writing numbers in expanded form, such as 1 234 being written as 1 + 234 instead of 1000 + 200 + 30 + 4.
- When comparing numbers with spaces, such as comparing 1 234 to 1234 and thinking they are different values.
- When solving math problems involving large numbers with spaces, such as adding or subtracting 1 234 from 5 678."
2328,"When using the capture-recapture method, believes the number caught second is the numerator and the number marked second is the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the capture-recapture method, which is used to estimate the population size of a particular species. They mistakenly believe that the number of individuals caught during the second capture is the numerator, and the number of individuals marked during the second capture is the denominator. This misconception is likely due to a misunderstanding of the method's formula and the roles of the different variables involved.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to calculate the estimated population size using the capture-recapture method and they use the incorrect values for the numerator and denominator.
- When a student is given a scenario where a certain number of animals are caught, marked, and released, and then a second capture is made, but they incorrectly apply the formula.
- When a student is asked to interpret the results of a capture-recapture study and they mistakenly conclude that the number caught second is the numerator and the number marked second is the denominator."
2329,Thinks the remainder is the difference between the dividend and the next biggest multiple,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of remainders in division. They may believe that the remainder is the difference between the dividend (the number being divided) and the next biggest multiple of the divisor, rather than the amount left over after the division.

For example, when dividing 17 by 5, a student with this misconception may think that the remainder is the difference between 17 and the next biggest multiple of 5 (which is 20), so they would calculate 20 - 17 = 3, and believe the remainder is 3. However, this is not the correct understanding of remainders.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When dividing 23 by 4, a student may think the remainder is 24 - 23 = 1, rather than the actual remainder.
- When dividing 19 by 3, a student may think the remainder is 21 - 19 = 2, rather than the actual remainder.
- When dividing 25 by 6, a student may think the remainder is 30 - 25 = 5, rather than the actual remainder.

This misconception highlights the need for students to understand the concept of remainders and how they are calculated in division."
2330,Rounds incorrectly by changing multiple place values,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly round numbers by altering multiple place values instead of just the one being rounded. For instance, when rounding a number to the nearest ten, they may change the ones place, but also unnecessarily change the tens or hundreds place. This shows a lack of understanding of the concept of rounding as a process of approximating a number by focusing on a specific place value.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Rounding 43 to the nearest ten: A student might incorrectly round it to 50 instead of 40, demonstrating a change in multiple place values.
- Rounding 975 to the nearest hundred: A student may round it to 1000 instead of 1000 being the correct answer when rounding to the nearest thousand, however, when rounding to the nearest hundred the correct answer is indeed 1000 but their reasoning is incorrect.
- Rounding 12.46 to the nearest tenth: A student might round it to 12.5 but then incorrectly write 12.50, demonstrating a change in multiple place values."
2331,Believes the angle in a pie chart sector is equal to the frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the angle of a sector in a pie chart directly represents the frequency or number of items in that category, rather than understanding that the angle is actually proportional to the fraction of the total data that the category represents.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When a student is creating a pie chart to represent the number of different colored cars in a parking lot and assumes that if there are 20 red cars and 10 blue cars, the angle for the red cars should be twice the angle for the blue cars, without considering the total number of cars.
- When a student is interpreting a pie chart showing the favorite sports of students in a school and believes that a sector with an angle of 90 degrees means that 90 students chose that sport, rather than realizing that the angle represents a proportion of the total number of students surveyed.
- When a student is comparing two pie charts, one representing the favorite foods of boys and the other representing the favorite foods of girls, and assumes that a sector with the same angle in both charts means that the same number of boys and girls chose that food, without considering the different total numbers of boys and girls surveyed."
2332,Uses slant height instead of perpendicular height to find area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a trapezium and mistakenly use the slant height instead of the perpendicular height. The slant height is the distance between the two parallel sides, but it is not perpendicular to them. Students may incorrectly assume that the slant height can be used to calculate the area of the trapezium, leading to an incorrect result.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a trapezium in a real-world application, such as calculating the area of a roof or a garden bed with a trapezoidal shape.
- When solving problems involving trapeziums in geometry, such as finding the area of a trapezium with given dimensions.
- When comparing the areas of different trapeziums, and students mistakenly use the slant height to make their calculations.
- When calculating the area of a composite shape that includes a trapezium, and students incorrectly use the slant height instead of the perpendicular height."
2333,Thinks there are 10 million mm in 1 km,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to accurately convert between different units of measurement, specifically between millimeters (mm) and kilometers (km). The student mistakenly believes that 1 kilometer is equal to 10 million millimeters, rather than the correct conversion of 1 kilometer being equal to 1,000,000 millimeters (since 1 km = 1000 m and 1 m = 1000 mm).

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When calculating the distance of a road or the length of a bridge in millimeters, given its length in kilometers.
- When comparing the lengths of objects measured in different units, such as the height of a building in millimeters versus its height in kilometers.
- When solving problems that involve converting between different units of measurement, such as converting the distance traveled by a vehicle from kilometers to millimeters."
2334,Does not know that angles around a point sum to 360,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware that the sum of angles around a point is always 360 degrees. They may think that the sum of angles can be more or less than 360 degrees, or that it depends on the size or shape of the angles. This misconception can lead students to make incorrect calculations and conclusions when working with angles and shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing or interpreting diagrams with multiple angles around a point, students may incorrectly calculate the sum of the angles.
- When solving problems involving the angles around a point in real-world contexts, such as design, architecture, or navigation, students may arrive at incorrect answers.
- When working with geometric shapes, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, or polygons, students may not recognize that the sum of the angles around a point remains constant at 360 degrees.
- When calculating missing angles in a diagram or shape, students may not use the fact that angles around a point sum to 360 degrees, leading to incorrect solutions."
2335,"When multiplying decimals, multiplies rather than divides when reinserting the decimal.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying decimals and incorrectly place the decimal point in the final product. They tend to multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers, but when reinserting the decimal point, they mistakenly count the total number of decimal places in the factors and add them instead of simply counting the total number of decimal places and placing the decimal point accordingly from the right. This results in an incorrect placement of the decimal point, often with the student placing it further to the right than necessary, effectively multiplying the value instead of simply adjusting for the original decimal places.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying 0.5 and 0.5: A student with this misconception may correctly multiply the numbers to get 25, but then incorrectly place the decimal point three places to the right, resulting in 250 instead of 0.25.
- Multiplying 2.5 and 3.2: The student multiplies the numbers to get 80, but then incorrectly adds the total number of decimal places, placing the decimal point four places to the right instead of three, resulting in 8000 instead of 8.0 or 8.
- Multiplying 1.2 and 4.5: The student multiplies the numbers to get 54, but then incorrectly adds the total number of decimal places, placing the decimal point three places to the right instead of two, resulting in 540 instead of 5.4."
2336,Confuses co-interior and corresponding angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between co-interior and corresponding angles, often mistakenly assuming they are the same or confusing their properties. Co-interior angles are the angles on the same side of the transversal and inside the two lines, whereas corresponding angles are the angles on the same side of the transversal and in the same relative position on each line.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying angles in a diagram: Students may incorrectly label co-interior angles as corresponding angles or vice versa, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationships between the angles.
- When applying angle properties: Students may mistakenly use the properties of co-interior angles (e.g., sum of 180°) when working with corresponding angles, or vice versa (e.g., assuming corresponding angles are equal).
- When solving angle problems: Students may incorrectly apply the properties of co-interior or corresponding angles, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions about the size of angles in a given diagram.
- When working with parallel lines: Students may struggle to identify the relationships between co-interior and corresponding angles when working with parallel lines and a transversal, leading to confusion about the properties of the angles."
2337,"Struggles to visualise how an object will look in 3D when given a plan view, front and side elevation","Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty in interpreting and combining 2D representations of an object to visualize its actual 3D structure. They may struggle to understand how the different views (plan, front, and side elevation) relate to each other and how they can be used to construct a 3D image of the object.

When given a plan view, front elevation, and side elevation, students may find it challenging to:

* Understand the relationships between the different views
* Visualize the object's dimensions, shape, and proportions
* Identify the positions of different features, such as corners, edges, and surfaces
* Recognize how the 2D views fit together to form the 3D object

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* Case 1: A student is given a plan view and front elevation of a building and is asked to draw the side elevation. They may struggle to visualize the building's 3D structure and accurately draw the side elevation.
* Case 2: A student is given a set of 2D views of a complex object, such as a machine part, and is asked to assemble the parts to form the 3D object. They may find it difficult to understand how the different parts fit together.
* Case 3: A student is given a 2D floor plan of a room and is asked to visualize the room's 3D layout, including the positions of furniture and other objects. They may struggle to imagine the room's dimensions and proportions."
2338,Believes the lower quartile is the lowest value in a list,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of quartiles in data analysis. They believe that the lower quartile (also known as the first quartile or Q1) is the smallest value in a dataset, rather than the median of the lower half of the data when it is arranged in order. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and interpretations of data, particularly when dealing with box plots and other graphical representations of data.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When students are asked to identify the lower quartile in a dataset and they point to the smallest value, rather than finding the median of the lower half of the data.
* When students are constructing box plots and they plot the lower quartile as the smallest value, rather than the correct position.
* When students are comparing datasets and they incorrectly conclude that one dataset has a lower quartile that is much lower than another, when in fact they are comparing the smallest values rather than the lower quartiles."
2339,Believes that reciprocals are undefined for negative numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the concept of reciprocals only applies to positive numbers. They may think that when a number is negative, its reciprocal cannot be determined or does not exist. This misunderstanding can stem from an incomplete understanding of the definition of reciprocals and how they are calculated.

For example, students with this misconception may struggle with the following cases:

- Case 1: Finding the reciprocal of -2. They may think that since -2 is negative, its reciprocal (1/-2) is undefined.
- Case 2: Simplifying the expression 1/-x, where x is a negative number. They may believe that this expression cannot be simplified because the reciprocal of a negative number is undefined.
- Case 3: Solving an equation that involves the reciprocal of a negative number, such as 1/-3 = x. They may incorrectly conclude that the equation has no solution because the reciprocal of -3 is undefined."
2340,Does not recognise when to find a multiple from a worded question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to identify situations in word problems where they need to find a multiple of a number. A multiple is the product of a number and an integer, but students with this misconception may not recognize the language or context that indicates multiplication is required. They may misinterpret key words or phrases that signal the need to find a multiple, leading to incorrect calculations or solutions.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Not recognizing that words like ""groups of,"" ""sets of,"" or ""batches of"" indicate multiplication.
* Failing to understand that phrases like ""three times as many"" or ""five groups of four"" require finding a multiple.
* Misinterpreting word problems that involve measurements, such as ""If a bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 books, how many books can the bookshelf hold in total?""
* Struggling with real-world applications, like ""If a recipe serves 4 people and you need to serve 12 people, how many times do you need to multiply the ingredients?""

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* ""Tom has 3 groups of 4 pencils. How many pencils does Tom have in total?""
* ""A toy car track is 5 blocks long. If Sara wants to build 3 identical tracks, how many blocks will she need?""
* ""A bakery sells 6 cupcakes in a box. If they need to package 24 cupcakes, how many boxes can they fill?"""
2341,Does not know how to calculate the sum of interior angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the formula to calculate the sum of interior angles in a polygon. They may believe that the sum of interior angles is the same for all shapes or may not understand the relationship between the number of sides in a polygon and the sum of its interior angles.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to find the sum of interior angles in different polygons, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, or hexagons.
- When students are given a polygon with a certain number of sides and are asked to calculate the sum of its interior angles.
- When students are asked to determine the measure of a missing angle in a polygon, given the measures of the other angles.
- When students are solving problems involving the properties of regular polygons, where the sum of interior angles is required.
- When students are comparing the sum of interior angles in different polygons, such as comparing the sum of interior angles in a triangle to that in a square."
2342,Believes they add the conversion factor when converting between units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting between different units of measurement, such as length, mass, or capacity. They mistakenly believe that to convert from one unit to another, they need to add the conversion factor instead of multiplying or dividing by it. This error can occur due to a lack of understanding of the concept of conversion factors and how they are used to change units.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Converting meters to centimeters: A student may add 100 (the conversion factor) to the number of meters instead of multiplying by 100.
- Converting grams to kilograms: A student may add 1000 (the conversion factor) to the number of grams instead of dividing by 1000.
- Converting liters to milliliters: A student may add 1000 (the conversion factor) to the number of liters instead of multiplying by 1000.
- Converting hours to minutes: A student may add 60 (the conversion factor) to the number of hours instead of multiplying by 60."
2343,Believes total frequency in a table is given by the sum of the categories given,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the total frequency in a table or chart is obtained by simply adding up the number of categories or groups listed, rather than understanding that the total frequency is actually the sum of the individual frequencies within each category.

For example, consider a table showing the favorite colors of students in a class:

| Color | Frequency |
| --- | --- |
| Red | 5 |
| Blue | 8 |
| Green | 3 |
| Yellow | 2 |

A student with this misconception might incorrectly state that the total frequency is 4 (the number of color categories), rather than calculating the actual total frequency by adding up the individual frequencies: 5 + 8 + 3 + 2 = 18.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When reading and interpreting tables or charts with categorical data
* When asked to find the total number of observations or data points in a dataset
* When working with bar graphs or histograms and misinterpreting the x-axis as the total frequency
* When calculating probabilities or percentages based on incorrect total frequencies."
2344,"When counting partial symbols on pictogram, uses the fraction rather than the amount it represents","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with pictograms, which are graphical representations of data that use symbols to represent a certain quantity. When a partial symbol is used to represent a fraction of the whole, some students mistakenly count it as the fraction itself, rather than the amount or value it represents. For example, if one whole symbol represents 5 items and a half symbol is used, they might count it as 0.5 instead of 2.5 or half of 5.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A pictogram shows the number of books read by students in a week, with one whole symbol representing 5 books. If a student reads 7 books, the pictogram might show one whole symbol and a 2/5 symbol. The student might count the 2/5 symbol as 0.4 or 2/5 instead of 2 books.
- A pictogram represents the number of hours spent watching TV, with one whole symbol representing 2 hours. If a person watches TV for 2 hours and 30 minutes, the pictogram might show one whole symbol and a 1/2 symbol. The student might count the 1/2 symbol as 0.5 instead of 1 hour.
- A pictogram shows the amount of rainfall in a week, with one whole symbol representing 10 mm. If it rains 12 mm, the pictogram might show one whole symbol and a 1/5 symbol. The student might count the 1/5 symbol as 0.2 or 1/5 instead of 2 mm."
2345,Counts half-squares as full squares when calculating area on a square grid,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a shape drawn on a square grid. They may incorrectly count half-squares or parts of squares as full squares, leading to an inaccurate calculation of the total area. This error is often due to a lack of understanding of the concept of area and how it relates to the grid. Students may not fully grasp that area is a measure of the amount of space inside a shape, and that counting half-squares as full squares would result in an overestimation of the actual area.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When calculating the area of a triangle or a shape with diagonal sides on a square grid, students might count the half-squares formed by the diagonal lines as full squares.
- When finding the area of a shape with curved boundaries, students may approximate the area by counting the full squares and including the partial squares as full squares.
- When comparing the areas of different shapes on a grid, students may miscount the half-squares, leading to incorrect conclusions about which shape has the larger area."
2346,"When subtracting decimals with a different number of decimal places, lines up the digits incorrectly","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are subtracting decimals with a different number of decimal places. They may incorrectly line up the digits, often aligning the digits based on their place value without considering the decimal point. This can lead to an incorrect subtraction calculation.

For example, consider the following subtraction problem: 5.25 - 2.5. A student with this misconception might line up the digits as follows:

```
  5.25
- 2.50
------
```
becomes 
```
  525
- 25
------
```
or

```
  5.25
- 2.5
------
```
becomes 
```
  5.25
- 2.50 (adding a zero but incorrectly placing it)
  becomes 
  525
- 250
------
```
or other misplacements.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

* 3.75 - 1.2
* 7.95 - 3.05
* 2.15 - 0.5
* 1.99 - 0.25

These cases will require students to correctly align the decimal points and perform the subtraction, which can be challenging for those with this misconception."
2347,Believes class width divided by frequency density gives frequency in a histogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between class width, frequency density, and frequency in a histogram. They may think that by dividing the class width by the frequency density, they can obtain the frequency of the data within a particular class interval. This error is likely due to a misunderstanding of the definition of frequency density, which is actually the frequency per unit of class width, not the other way around.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to find the frequency of a particular class interval in a histogram and they are given the class width and frequency density.
- When students are constructing their own histograms and need to calculate the frequency of each class interval, but they mistakenly use the class width divided by frequency density formula.
- When students are comparing the frequencies of different class intervals in a histogram and incorrectly use the class width divided by frequency density calculation to determine the frequencies."
2348,Believes the number of edges on a 3D shape match those of the 2D cross section,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the properties of 2D and 3D shapes. They may incorrectly assume that the number of edges on a 3D shape is the same as the number of edges on a 2D cross-section of that shape. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect counting and identification of edges on various 3D shapes.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When counting the edges of a cube, a student may draw a 2D cross-section of the cube (a square) and assume the cube has 4 edges, rather than the actual 12 edges.

2. When analyzing a cylinder, a student might draw a 2D cross-section (a circle) and think the cylinder has no edges, when in fact, it has two circular edges (the top and bottom) and a curved lateral surface.

3. When examining a pyramid, a student may draw a 2D cross-section (a triangle) and believe the pyramid has 3 edges, when actually it has more edges depending on the type of pyramid (e.g., a square pyramid has 8 edges).

4. When comparing a 3D sphere to its 2D cross-section (a circle), a student may think the sphere has no edges, which is correct, but for the wrong reason. They might assume it's because the 2D cross-section has no edges, rather than understanding that a sphere by definition has no edges."
2349,Forgets that a number divided by itself is 1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overlook the basic property of division that any non-zero number divided by itself equals 1. For instance, 5 ÷ 5 = 1. Students might get confused, thinking that dividing a number by itself would result in the number itself (e.g., 5 ÷ 5 = 5) or might get an undefined result.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Simplifying fractions: When students simplify fractions, they may forget to divide the numerator and the denominator by the greatest common divisor (GCD) when the numerator and the denominator are the same, e.g., 5/5.
- Solving algebraic equations: In cases where an algebraic equation involves dividing both sides by a variable, students may forget to consider the possibility that the variable could be the same on both the numerator and the denominator.
- Percentage calculations: When calculating percentages, students might get confused when a quantity is being compared to itself (e.g., finding 100% of a number), leading to division by the same number.
- Ratio problems: In ratio problems, students may encounter scenarios where a quantity is being divided by itself, and they may get confused about the result."
2350,"When multiplying a decimal less than 1 by an integer, gives an answer 10 times bigger than it should be","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of decimal place value and how it behaves during multiplication. They may incorrectly assume that multiplying a decimal less than 1 by an integer will shift the decimal point to the right, making the result 10 times larger than it should be. This error can stem from a lack of understanding of how decimals represent fractions and how multiplication affects the magnitude of a number.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

* Multiplying 0.5 by 4, students might think the answer is 50 instead of 2.
* Multiplying 0.8 by 3, students might think the answer is 80 instead of 2.4.
* Multiplying 0.2 by 9, students might think the answer is 200 instead of 1.8.
* Multiplying 0.4 by 6, students might think the answer is 400 instead of 2.4."
2351,Believes to find the angle for a pie chart sector you calculate 360 divided by the frequency of that sector,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that to find the angle of a sector in a pie chart, they need to divide 360 degrees by the frequency (number of occurrences) of that sector. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations, as students may overlook the importance of the total number of data points or the proportion of the sector in relation to the whole.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given a simple pie chart with a small number of sectors and are asked to calculate the angle of one sector. For example, if a pie chart has 3 sectors with frequencies 5, 3, and 2, a student with this misconception might calculate the angle of the sector with frequency 5 as 360 ÷ 5 = 72 degrees.
- When students are dealing with pie charts that have sectors with equal frequencies, they may coincidentally get the correct answer using this method, reinforcing their misconception. For instance, if a pie chart has 4 sectors, each with a frequency of 5, a student might correctly calculate the angle of one sector as 360 ÷ 4 = 90 degrees (although their reasoning is incorrect).
- When students are working with pie charts that have a large number of sectors or complex data, their misconception may lead to more obvious errors. For example, if a pie chart has 10 sectors with varying frequencies, a student with this misconception might struggle to calculate the correct angles using their incorrect method."
2352,Writes the index as a digit on the end of a number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly write the index (or exponent) of a number as a digit that is simply appended to the end of the number, rather than understanding that it represents a power to which the number should be raised. For example, students may write 2^3 as 23, rather than recognizing that the 3 represents the exponent that indicates 2 should be cubed.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to indices and exponents and struggle to understand the notation.
- When students are multiplying numbers with the same base, but different exponents, and fail to apply the rules of indices correctly.
- When students are working with numbers in scientific notation, where the index is used to represent the power of 10.
- When students are simplifying expressions with indices, such as (2^3) x (2^2), and fail to apply the rules of indices correctly."
2353,Does not divide by 2 when calculating the area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the area of a trapezium and forget or fail to divide the sum of the product of the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides and the height by 2. The formula for the area of a trapezium is (1/2) × (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) × height, which requires the division by 2. However, some students might simply multiply the sum of the lengths of the parallel sides by the height, resulting in an incorrect calculation.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the area of a trapezium with parallel sides of different lengths and a given height.
- When comparing the areas of different trapeziums and forgetting to divide by 2 in the formula.
- When solving problems that involve finding the height or one of the parallel sides of a trapezium, given its area and other dimensions.
- When calculating the area of composite shapes that include trapeziums.
- When applying the formula for the area of a trapezium in real-world problems, such as finding the area of a roof or a garden bed with a trapezium shape."
2354,"When describing a translation, identifies the correct number of jumps but mixes up the directions .","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students understand the concept of translation as a series of jumps or movements from one point to another, but they struggle with accurately describing the direction of these jumps. They may correctly identify the number of units to move, but incorrectly state the direction (e.g., moving left instead of right, or up instead of down). This can be due to a lack of spatial awareness, difficulty visualizing the movement, or simply a misunderstanding of the coordinate grid.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When describing the translation of a shape on a grid, a student might say ""move 3 units left"" instead of ""move 3 units right"".
- When following instructions to translate a point on a coordinate plane, a student might move the point up 2 units instead of down 2 units.
- When describing the translation of a real-life object, such as moving a book on a shelf, a student might say ""move the book 5 spaces to the left"" when they mean to say ""move the book 5 spaces to the right""."
2355,Does not know how to find order of rotational symmetry,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the concept of rotational symmetry and how to determine the order of rotational symmetry of a shape. They may believe that the order of rotational symmetry is simply the number of sides of a shape, or that it is only related to regular polygons. However, the order of rotational symmetry is actually the number of times a shape looks the same after a 360-degree rotation, divided by the angle of rotation.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in identifying and describing the symmetries of various shapes, including irregular polygons, circles, and other geometric figures.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is given a regular hexagon and asked to find its order of rotational symmetry. They may answer 6, simply because it has 6 sides, without considering the angle of rotation.
- Case 2: A student is shown a picture of a circle and asked to determine its order of rotational symmetry. They may say it has no rotational symmetry, because it has no corners or edges, or that it has infinite rotational symmetry, without understanding the concept of continuous symmetry.
- Case 3: A student is given an irregular polygon, such as a rhombus, and asked to find its order of rotational symmetry. They may struggle to identify the symmetries, or believe that it has no rotational symmetry because it is not a regular polygon."
2356,Thinks a difference of one part in a ratio means the quantities will differ by one unit,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the difference in the ratio as a direct difference in the quantities being compared. They fail to understand that a ratio represents a proportional relationship between the quantities, not an absolute difference. 

For instance, if a recipe requires a ratio of 3 parts flour to 2 parts sugar, students with this misconception might believe that if they use 4 parts flour, they just need to add 1 more unit of sugar (i.e., 3 parts flour is 1 more than 2 parts, so 4 parts flour means 3 parts sugar). They do not recognize that the increase in flour requires a corresponding proportional increase in sugar to maintain the ratio.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios:

- Baking: When scaling up a recipe, students might incorrectly adjust the ingredients, resulting in an unbalanced mixture.
- Music or art: When creating a composition or pattern based on a specific ratio, students might misinterpret the proportional relationship, leading to an unbalanced or unharmonious piece.
- Building design: In architecture, students might misapply ratios when designing buildings or rooms, leading to structural or aesthetic issues.
- Science experiments: When mixing substances in a specific ratio, students might get incorrect results or even create safety hazards if they misunderstand the proportional relationships."
2357,Thinks sign for parallel lines just means opposite,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the symbol for parallel lines (||) indicates that the lines are opposite each other, rather than understanding that it represents lines that never intersect and maintain a constant distance from each other. They may think that parallel lines must be on opposite sides of a shape or diagram, rather than recognizing that they can be anywhere in the same plane as long as they do not intersect.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When drawing shapes with parallel sides, students may assume that the parallel sides must be opposite each other, rather than recognizing that they can be adjacent sides.
- When identifying parallel lines in a diagram, students may only look for lines that are on opposite sides of a shape, rather than checking if they are truly parallel.
- When solving problems involving parallel lines, students may incorrectly assume that the lines must be opposite each other, leading to incorrect conclusions and calculations."
2358,Believes even numbers can have odd multiples,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the properties of even numbers and their multiples. They may think that even numbers can have odd multiples because they are focusing solely on the fact that an even number multiplied by an odd number results in an even number. However, they fail to recognize that the result of multiplying an even number by any integer will always be even. 

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify the pattern of multiples of even numbers. For instance, they may think that 4 (an even number) can have 3 (an odd number) as a multiple, or that 6 (an even number) can have 9 (an odd number) as a multiple.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to list the multiples of an even number, students may include odd numbers in the list.
- When identifying patterns in number sequences, students may incorrectly predict the next number in the sequence due to their misunderstanding of even and odd multiples.
- When solving multiplication problems involving even numbers, students may incorrectly assume that the result can be an odd number.
- When working with real-world applications, such as arranging objects in groups, students may incorrectly assume that an even number of groups can have an odd number of objects in each group."
2359,Believes division is commutative ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the order of numbers in a division operation does not affect the result. In other words, they think that dividing a by b is the same as dividing b by a (a ÷ b = b ÷ a). This misunderstanding can stem from their prior knowledge of addition and multiplication, which are commutative operations. Students may incorrectly generalize this property to division, leading to errors in their calculations.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dividing two different numbers, such as 12 ÷ 4 and 4 ÷ 12, and expecting the same result.
- When solving word problems that involve sharing or grouping, and assuming that the order of the numbers does not matter.
- When simplifying fractions, and mistakenly swapping the numerator and denominator without changing the value of the fraction."
2360,Thinks the scale factor is found by adding the lengths of two corresponding sides together,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of scale factor in geometry. They mistakenly believe that to find the scale factor between two similar shapes, they need to add the lengths of the corresponding sides of the two shapes together, rather than dividing them. This error can occur when students are not clear about the definition of scale factor, which is the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides of two similar shapes.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When comparing the lengths of corresponding sides of two similar triangles, a student may add the lengths of the sides together, thinking that the scale factor is the sum of the two lengths.
* When enlarging a shape by a certain scale factor, a student may add the original length to the new length, instead of multiplying the original length by the scale factor.
* When solving a problem involving the scale factor of two similar rectangles, a student may add the lengths of the corresponding sides, rather than dividing them to find the scale factor."
2361,Believes a fraction out of a number other than 100 represents a percentage,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that any fraction, regardless of its denominator, can be directly interpreted as a percentage. They may think that the fraction's value represents a proportion out of 100, even if the denominator is not 100. For example, they might think that 3/5 is equivalent to 3% or that 2/10 is the same as 2%.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When comparing fractions with different denominators, students may incorrectly assume that the fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction, without considering the denominators.
- When converting fractions to percentages, students may simply take the numerator as the percentage value, ignoring the denominator.
- When solving problems involving proportions or ratios, students may misinterpret fractions as percentages, leading to incorrect calculations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. A student is given a fraction 3/8 and asked to express it as a percentage. They may incorrectly answer 3%.
2. A recipe calls for 2/5 of a cup of sugar, and a student thinks this means 2% of a cup.
3. A survey shows that 4/10 people prefer a certain product, and a student believes this means 4% of people prefer it."
2362,Believes angles on a straight line add to 360 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the concept that the sum of angles in a circle (or a full rotation) is 360 degrees to the sum of angles on a straight line. They may incorrectly assume that the angles on a straight line also form a full rotation, resulting in the sum being 360 degrees. 

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When asked to find the missing angle on a straight line, a student might subtract the given angle from 360 degrees instead of 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving intersecting lines or transversals, students might incorrectly calculate the sum of angles on a straight line as 360 degrees.
- When drawing or interpreting diagrams with angles on a straight line, students may incorrectly label or calculate the angles based on the assumption that they add up to 360 degrees."
2363,Assumes fractions with prime numerators cannot be simplified,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that if the numerator of a fraction is a prime number, then the fraction cannot be simplified further. They may think that simplification requires the numerator to be divided by a common factor, and since prime numbers only have 1 and themselves as factors, no simplification is possible. However, this overlooks the possibility that the denominator may have the prime number as a factor, allowing for simplification.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* Simplifying the fraction 7/14, where students might think that since 7 is prime, the fraction cannot be simplified, when in fact it can be reduced to 1/2.
* Reducing the fraction 5/15, where students may assume that the prime numerator 5 means no simplification is possible, when actually the fraction can be simplified to 1/3.
* Comparing fractions with prime numerators, such as 3/6 and 5/10, where students might incorrectly conclude that neither fraction can be simplified, when in fact they can be reduced to 1/2."
2364,Believes all possible outcomes must have equal probability,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that in any situation involving chance or probability, all possible outcomes have an equal likelihood of occurring. They may believe that just because there are multiple outcomes, each one must have the same chance of happening, ignoring the fact that some outcomes may be more or less likely due to various factors.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- Coin tosses or die rolls with biased or weighted coins/dice, where some outcomes are intentionally made more likely.
- Real-life situations, such as predicting the weather (e.g., it's more likely to rain on a cloudy day) or the likelihood of a sports team winning based on their past performance.
- Events with multiple stages or conditions, where some outcomes may be more likely due to the previous conditions or stages.
- Situations where the probability changes over time or with new information, such as drawing cards from a deck without replacement.
- Predicting outcomes based on incomplete or biased data, leading to incorrect assumptions about equal probabilities."
2365,Confuses vertically opposite angles with angles on a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that vertically opposite angles and angles on a straight line are the same concept or have the same properties. Vertically opposite angles are formed when two lines intersect, resulting in two pairs of congruent angles that are opposite each other. On the other hand, angles on a straight line refer to the angles formed when a line intersects another line, resulting in a straight angle that measures 180 degrees.

Students with this misconception may incorrectly assume that any two angles that appear ""opposite"" each other, whether formed by intersecting lines or a straight line, are automatically equal or have the same properties. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions in geometric problems.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When identifying and calculating angles in diagrams involving intersecting lines and straight lines.
* When solving problems involving angles in shapes, such as triangles, quadrilaterals, and polygons.
* When applying angle properties to real-world situations, such as designing buildings, bridges, or other structures.
* When interpreting and describing geometric relationships between angles in mathematical and everyday contexts."
2366,Mixes up the words “to” and “past” when telling the time,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the vocabulary used to tell time, particularly the words ""to"" and ""past"". They may incorrectly use these words when describing times, for example, saying ""5 to 3"" instead of ""5 past 2"" or vice versa. This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the relationships between the hour and minute hands on an analog clock face.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When telling time on an analog clock, a student might say ""the time is 5 to 3"" when the correct time is 2:05 (5 past 2).
- When writing times in words, a student might write ""5 to 3"" instead of ""5 past 2"".
- When answering time-related questions, a student might respond with incorrect vocabulary usage, such as ""I have a meeting 10 to 4"" instead of ""I have a meeting 10 past 3""."
2367,Confuses dependent and mutually exclusive events,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between dependent and mutually exclusive events in probability. They may incorrectly assume that events are either always independent or always mutually exclusive, without considering the specific relationship between the events.

Dependent events are those where the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the other event. For example, drawing two cards from a deck without replacement. Students may incorrectly assume that the events are independent, and the probability remains the same.

Mutually exclusive events, on the other hand, are those where the occurrence of one event makes it impossible for the other event to occur. For example, flipping a coin and getting either heads or tails. Students may incorrectly assume that events are mutually exclusive when, in fact, they are not.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. Coin toss: A student thinks that getting a head on the first toss makes it more likely to get a tail on the second toss, treating the events as dependent.
2. Card drawing: A student assumes that drawing a heart from a deck makes it equally likely to draw another heart on the next draw, treating the events as independent.
3. Rolling dice: A student believes that rolling a 6 on one die makes it impossible to roll a 6 on the second die, treating the events as mutually exclusive.
4. Lottery draws: A student thinks that winning the lottery one week makes it less likely to win the next week, treating the events as dependent."
2368,Converts a fraction to a percentage by placing a decimal point between the numerator and denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the process of converting a fraction to a percentage. They incorrectly assume that simply placing a decimal point between the numerator and the denominator will automatically convert the fraction to a percentage. This error is often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between fractions, decimals, and percentages.

For example, when given the fraction 3/4, a student with this misconception may incorrectly convert it to a percentage by placing a decimal point between the numerator and denominator, resulting in 3.4%. Similarly, for the fraction 2/5, they might incorrectly convert it to 2.5%.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- Converting the fraction 1/2 to a percentage (student's answer: 1.2%)
- Converting the fraction 3/10 to a percentage (student's answer: 3.10%)
- Converting the fraction 2/8 to a percentage (student's answer: 2.8%)"
2369,Does not know protractor should be positioned with one side of the angle at 0,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the proper usage of a protractor, a tool used to measure angles in degrees. They may not understand that to accurately measure an angle, one side of the angle (either the left or right side) should be aligned with the zero-degree mark on the protractor. This ensures that the protractor is properly calibrated to provide an accurate measurement. 

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to measure angles in a geometric shape, such as a triangle or quadrilateral, and they randomly place the protractor on the angle without aligning it correctly.
- During construction tasks, where students need to create angles of specific degrees, and they fail to position the protractor correctly, resulting in incorrect measurements.
- When solving problems involving angle calculations, such as finding the sum of interior angles in a polygon, and students incorrectly measure the angles due to improper protractor placement.
- In real-world applications, such as measuring the angle of elevation or depression in a building design, where accurate angle measurements are crucial, and incorrect protractor placement can lead to significant errors."
2370,Uses angles on a straight line in the wrong context ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly apply the rule that the sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees to situations where the angles are not actually on a straight line. They may mistakenly believe that any two or more angles that appear to be ""in a line"" or ""next to each other"" will add up to 180 degrees, without considering the actual geometric relationship between the angles.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Assuming that the sum of two adjacent angles in a shape is always 180 degrees, without checking if they are actually on a straight line.
* Incorrectly applying the rule to angles that are not adjacent or not on the same line.
* Failing to recognize that the angles must be on the same plane and not intersecting or forming a corner.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

* When calculating the sum of angles in a triangle or other polygon, students may incorrectly assume that two angles that appear to be in a line will add up to 180 degrees.
* When solving problems involving intersecting lines, students may mistakenly apply the rule to angles that are not actually on a straight line.
* When working with 3D shapes, students may incorrectly assume that angles on different planes will add up to 180 degrees."
2371,Believes a direct proportion graph is a horizontal line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of direct proportionality. They may think that since the ratio between the variables remains constant, the graph should be a horizontal line, indicating a constant value. However, they fail to recognize that direct proportionality means that as one variable increases, the other variable also increases at a constant rate, resulting in a straight line that passes through the origin (0, 0) but is not horizontal.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to graph the relationship between the cost of goods and the number of items purchased, where the cost is directly proportional to the number of items.
- When exploring the relationship between the distance traveled and the time taken, where the distance is directly proportional to the time.
- When analyzing the relationship between the amount of a substance and its volume, where the amount is directly proportional to the volume."
2372,"Believes that when factorising a quadratic with a coefficient of x squared, the two constants in the brackets still add to give the coefficient of x","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are factorising quadratics of the form ax^2 + bx + c, where a is not equal to 1. They incorrectly assume that when factorising into the form (px + q)(rx + s), the sum of q and s will always equal the coefficient of x (b). However, this is only true when the coefficient of x^2 (a) is 1. When a is not 1, the relationship between the constants in the brackets and the coefficient of x is more complex.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorising 2x^2 + 5x + 3, a student might incorrectly think that the two constants in the brackets must add up to 5.
- Factorising 3x^2 + 7x + 2, a student might mistakenly believe that the sum of the two constants in the brackets should be 7.
- Factorising 4x^2 + 9x + 5, a student may incorrectly assume that the two constants in the brackets should add up to 9."
2373,Does not understand parts must be equal in a fraction diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that in a fraction diagram, the parts or sections must be equal in size, shape, and area. They may incorrectly assume that as long as a shape is divided into parts, it represents a fraction, regardless of the size or proportion of those parts. This misunderstanding can lead students to misinterpret or misrepresent fractions in various contexts.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or interpreting fraction diagrams: A student might draw a circle divided into two parts, but one part is significantly larger than the other, and still label it as 1/2.
- When comparing fractions: Students may mistakenly compare fractions with unequal parts, thinking that the number of parts is the only factor that matters.
- When adding or subtracting fractions: The misconception can lead to incorrect calculations when students add or subtract fractions with different-sized parts, assuming they can simply add or subtract the numerators and denominators without considering the size of the parts.
- When solving real-world problems: Students may apply their misconceptions to practical problems, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza among friends, leading to incorrect solutions."
2374,Believes a quarter of 2 is 0.25,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of fractions, specifically quarters. They may have learned that a quarter is equivalent to 0.25, which is correct when referring to a quarter of a whole unit (e.g., a quarter of 1). However, they incorrectly apply this understanding to a quarter of other numbers, such as 2, assuming that a quarter of 2 is also 0.25. This shows a lack of understanding of proportional relationships and how fractions work with different whole numbers.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A recipe requires a quarter of 2 cups of sugar, and the student thinks they need 0.25 cups.
- A student is asked to find a quarter of 2 kilograms and responds with 0.25 kilograms.
- A group of friends want to share a bag of candy equally, and one student thinks that a quarter of 2 bags is 0.25 bags."
2375,Does not equate the value of a number with the place value column it is in,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to understand that the value of a digit within a number is dependent on its position or place value. They may treat each digit as a separate entity, without considering the column it belongs to, such as hundreds, tens, or ones. This misunderstanding can lead students to incorrectly perform arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, or compare numbers without considering the place value of each digit.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When adding or subtracting numbers with multiple digits, students may add or subtract the digits individually without considering their place value. For example, when adding 45 + 27, they may add 4 + 2 and 5 + 7 separately, without considering the tens and ones columns.
2. When comparing numbers, students may compare the digits individually without considering their place value. For example, when comparing 456 and 427, they may say 427 is larger because 7 is greater than 6, without considering the hundreds column.
3. When rounding numbers, students may round the digits individually without considering their place value. For example, when rounding 456 to the nearest hundred, they may round the 6 to a 10, resulting in 460, instead of rounding to the nearest hundred (500).
4. When performing arithmetic operations with decimals, students may not consider the place value of each digit. For example, when adding 2.5 + 1.8, they may add the digits individually without considering the tenths and ones columns."
2376,"When finding the nth term of a linear sequence, thinks the the first term is the coefficient in front of n.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the general formula for the nth term of a linear sequence, which is typically given as: an = a + (n-1)d, where 'a' is the first term and 'd' is the common difference. However, when the formula is written in a simplified form as an = c + dn (where c is a constant), some students mistakenly believe that the coefficient of 'n' (which is 'd') is the first term of the sequence.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When the sequence starts with a number that is not equal to the common difference, but the formula is written in the simplified form.
- When the sequence has a common difference that is the same as the first term, reinforcing the student's misconception.
- When the student is given a sequence with a negative or fractional common difference, making it harder for them to understand the relationship between the first term and the coefficient of 'n'.
- When the student is asked to find the nth term of a sequence given in a word problem, and they mistakenly identify the coefficient of 'n' as the starting value of the sequence."
2377,Does not know the definition of term or term-to-term rule,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unable to define or identify the rule that governs a sequence or pattern. In sequences, a term is a number or value in the sequence, and the term-to-term rule is the operation or relationship that connects each term to the next one. Students with this misconception may struggle to recognize, describe, or apply the rule to generate subsequent terms in a sequence.

This misconception may manifest in various ways, such as:

- Difficulty identifying the next term in a simple arithmetic or geometric sequence (e.g., 2, 5, 8, ?).
- Struggling to recognize patterns in number sequences, such as counting by multiples (e.g., 3, 6, 9, ?) or adding/subtracting a fixed number (e.g., 5, 8, 11, ?).
- Inability to describe the rule governing a sequence, such as ""add 3"" or ""multiply by 2"".
- Difficulty generating a sequence given a starting term and a term-to-term rule (e.g., ""Start with 2 and add 4 each time"").
- Struggling to recognize or apply term-to-term rules in real-world contexts, such as predicting the next value in a data set or understanding how a quantity changes over time."
2378,Divides total amount by each side of the ratio instead of dividing by the sum of the parts,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to share a quantity in a given ratio. They tend to divide the total amount by each part of the ratio separately, rather than dividing it by the sum of the parts. This indicates a lack of understanding of how ratios work and how they represent proportional relationships.

For example, if a bag of sweets is to be shared in the ratio 2:3 between two people, a student with this misconception might divide the total number of sweets by 2 and then by 3, instead of adding 2 and 3 to get 5 and then dividing the total number of sweets by 5.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

* A recipe requires a ratio of 3:5 of sugar to flour. If the student is asked to make a cake using 120g of sugar and flour, they might divide 120g by 3 and then by 5, instead of dividing 120g by 8 (3+5).
* A group of friends want to share some money in the ratio 2:4:6. If they have a total of $120, a student with this misconception might divide $120 by 2, then by 4, and then by 6, instead of adding 2+4+6 to get 12 and then dividing $120 by 12.
* A farmer has a field that is to be divided in the ratio 3:7 between two crops. If the field is 100 hectares, a student with this misconception might divide 100 hectares by 3 and then by 7, instead of adding 3+7 to get 10 and then dividing 100 hectares by 10."
2379,Unable to equate two divisions with a single division,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand that dividing a quantity by one number and then dividing the result by another number is equivalent to dividing the original quantity by the product of the two numbers. In other words, students may not recognize that a ÷ b ÷ c is equal to a ÷ (b × c). 

This misconception can lead to difficulties in simplifying expressions and solving problems that involve multiple divisions.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- A recipe requires 18 cookies to be shared equally among 3 people, and then each person wants to share their cookies with 2 of their friends. Students may calculate 18 ÷ 3 = 6, and then 6 ÷ 2 = 3, without realizing that this is equivalent to 18 ÷ (3 × 2).
- A group of 24 students are divided into 4 teams, and then each team is further divided into 3 sub-groups. Students may struggle to understand that this is equivalent to dividing 24 students into 12 sub-groups (24 ÷ (4 × 3)).
- A water tank can hold 48 liters of water. If 4 tanks are used to fill 3 large containers, students may have difficulty calculating how many liters each container will hold (48 × 4 ÷ (3 × 4) or 48 ÷ 3)."
2380,Believes f(x) - a translates the function up a units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of subtracting a constant 'a' from a function f(x). They believe that subtracting 'a' from the function shifts the graph of the function upwards by 'a' units. In reality, this operation has the opposite effect. Students with this misconception may struggle to correctly graph functions that involve vertical translations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Graphing a simple function like f(x) = x^2 and asked to graph f(x) - 2, the student will incorrectly shift the graph of f(x) = x^2 up by 2 units.
- When solving a problem that involves finding the equation of a transformed function, such as a parabola shifted downwards, the student will write the equation as f(x) - a, expecting the graph to shift up by 'a' units.
- In a real-world context, such as modeling the cost of producing a certain product, students may misinterpret the effect of subtracting a fixed cost from the cost function, leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between the cost and the number of units produced."
2381,"Confuses the lower bound and upper bound, and writes the lower bound as a value that would end in recurring 9's, for example","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of bounds, specifically the lower and upper bounds of a measurement or a number. In the context of measurement and rounding, the lower and upper bounds refer to the smallest and largest possible values that a measurement can be. However, some students may incorrectly write the lower bound as a value that ends in recurring 9's, rather than the correct value.

For example, if a measurement is given as 5.4 cm to one decimal place, the lower bound would be 5.35 cm (not 5.39999... cm), and the upper bound would be 5.45 cm. Similarly, if a number is rounded to the nearest whole number, the lower and upper bounds would be the two consecutive whole numbers between which the original number lies.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- When rounding measurements to a certain degree of accuracy (e.g., to the nearest 10, 100, 0.1, etc.).
- When finding the lower and upper bounds of a measurement or number that has been rounded to a certain degree of accuracy.
- When working with inequalities or ranges of values, where the lower and upper bounds need to be correctly identified.
- When solving problems involving measurement errors or uncertainties, where understanding the correct lower and upper bounds is crucial."
2382,Believes that y = m +cx is the equation of a straight line,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly reverse or alter the order of variables in the slope-intercept form of a linear equation. The correct equation, y = mx + c, is often confused with the incorrect form, y = m + cx. In this misconception, the student incorrectly places the constant 'c' (which represents the y-intercept) as being multiplied by the variable 'x', and the slope 'm' is added as a constant, rather than being multiplied by 'x'.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students first learn about linear equations and are introduced to the slope-intercept form.
- When students are asked to graph a linear equation and mistakenly reverse the roles of 'm' and 'c'.
- When students are given word problems involving linear relationships and incorrectly apply the equation.
- When students are working with complex equations and may mistakenly apply the incorrect form of the equation.
- When students are under time pressure or stress during a test or quiz, leading to careless errors."
2383,When multiplying by 1 gives an answer of 1 (for a number other than 1),"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplication, specifically the effect of multiplying a number by 1. They may believe that when you multiply any number by 1, the result is always 1, rather than understanding that multiplying by 1 leaves the original number unchanged. For example, they may think that 5 × 1 = 1, rather than 5.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When dealing with word problems that involve scaling or resizing, where students may incorrectly assume that multiplying by 1 reduces the quantity to 1.
- When simplifying algebraic expressions, where students may incorrectly simplify equations by replacing any term multiplied by 1 with 1.
- When working with equivalent ratios or proportions, where students may incorrectly assume that multiplying a ratio by 1 changes the value to 1.
- When solving problems involving percentages or fractions, where students may incorrectly calculate the result of multiplying a number by 1 as 1."
2384,"When simplifying surds, does not square root the largest square number that goes into the number under the surd before putting it in front of the surd","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are simplifying surds, but they fail to identify the largest perfect square factor of the number under the radical sign. Instead of factoring out the largest square number, they may factor out a smaller square number or not factor out any square number at all, leading to an incorrect simplification.

For example, when simplifying √48, a student with this misconception may write it as √16 * √3 = 4√3, but then fail to recognize that 16 is not the largest perfect square factor of 48. Similarly, when simplifying √72, they may write it as √8 * √9 = √8 * 3, without recognizing that 36 (6^2) is the largest perfect square factor of 72.

This misconception can also occur in more complex simplifications, such as √(72 * 2) or √(48/3), where the student's failure to identify the largest perfect square factor can lead to incorrect simplifications.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

* Simplifying √48 to √16 * √3 instead of √(16*3)
* Simplifying √72 to √8 * √9 instead of √(36*2)
* Simplifying √(72 * 2) to √(8 * 9 * 2) instead of √(36*4)
* Simplifying √(48/3) to √(16/3 * 3) instead of √(16*1)"
2385,Thinks that the lower and upper bound for a truncated number can be found in the same was as when it has been rounded,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are familiar with finding the lower and upper bounds of a number that has been rounded, but they incorrectly assume that the same method applies to numbers that have been truncated. When a number is truncated, it means that the digits after a certain point have been simply cut off, without considering whether the cut-off portion is less than or greater than half. 

Students with this misconception may apply the rules for rounded numbers to truncated numbers, leading to incorrect lower and upper bounds. For example, if a number has been truncated to 4.5, a student might think the lower bound is 4.45 and the upper bound is 4.55, applying the logic used for rounded numbers. However, the actual bounds for a truncated number would depend on the specific context of the truncation, which could result in different bounds.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to find the lower and upper bounds of a measurement that has been truncated to the nearest tenth, and they incorrectly apply the rules for rounded measurements.
- A student truncates a calculation result to a certain number of decimal places and then incorrectly determines the lower and upper bounds using the rounded number rules.
- A student is given a truncated value in a word problem and is asked to find the range of possible values, but they incorrectly apply the rules for rounded values to find the lower and upper bounds."
2386,Believes there is a multiplicative relationship between values of terms in a linear sequence e.g. 10th term is double 5th term,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a linear sequence has a multiplicative relationship between its terms. They may think that if the 5th term is a certain value, the 10th term will be double that value, or the 15th term will be triple that value. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the true nature of linear sequences, where each term is obtained by adding a fixed constant to the previous term.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When finding the nth term of a linear sequence, students may try to multiply the first term by a certain factor to get the answer.
- When comparing terms in a sequence, students may incorrectly assume that the ratio between terms is constant.
- When graphing a linear sequence, students may expect to see a curve that doubles or triples at certain intervals, rather than a straight line.
- When solving problems involving linear sequences, students may mistakenly use multiplication instead of addition to find the next term in the sequence.
- When analyzing real-world data that follows a linear sequence, students may misinterpret the data as showing exponential growth or decay."
2387,"When finding a fraction of a fraction, divided by the whole fraction instead of the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a fraction of a fraction. For instance, if they're asked to find 1/2 of 3/4, they might incorrectly divide 3/4 by the whole fraction 1/2, instead of multiplying 3/4 by 1/2 or dividing 3/4 by the denominator 2 and then multiplying by the numerator 1. 

This misconception can occur in various cases such as:

- When simplifying complex fractions, like 1/2 of 2/3
- When finding proportions, like 3/4 of 2/5
- When solving real-world problems involving fractional parts, like finding 3/4 of 1/2 of a pizza that has been eaten."
2388,Uses formula for area of a parallelogram when finding the area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the formula for the area of a parallelogram (A = base × height) to find the area of a trapezium. They may overlook the fact that a trapezium has two parallel sides of different lengths, which requires a different formula to calculate its area. As a result, students may incorrectly use the length of one of the parallel sides as the base and multiply it by the height, leading to an incorrect calculation of the area.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When finding the area of a trapezium with two parallel sides of different lengths, students may use the length of the shorter or longer side as the base and multiply it by the height.
* When dealing with a trapezium that has a right angle, students may mistakenly treat it as a rectangle or a parallelogram and use the formula A = base × height.
* When solving problems involving real-world applications, such as finding the area of a roof or a garden bed with a trapezoidal shape, students may incorrectly apply the parallelogram formula due to a lack of understanding of the trapezium's unique properties."
2389,"When using a function machine, confuses the input and the output.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the relationship between the input and output values in a function machine. A function machine is a mathematical model where an input value is transformed into an output value according to a specific rule. Students with this misconception may mistakenly believe that the input value is the result of the function, rather than the starting value that is transformed by the function to produce the output.

For example, if a function machine has a rule that ""adds 2"" to the input value, students with this misconception may think that if the output value is 5, then the input value must be 7 (i.e., 5 + 2), rather than realizing that the input value is actually 3 (since 3 + 2 = 5).

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When writing function rules, students may write the output value as the input value and vice versa.
* When using a function machine to solve problems, students may mistakenly use the output value as the starting value, rather than the input value.
* When interpreting function graphs, students may confuse the x-axis (input values) with the y-axis (output values).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A function machine has a rule that ""multiplies by 3"". If the output value is 12, students with this misconception may think that the input value is 15, rather than realizing that the input value is actually 4 (since 4 × 3 = 12).
* Case 2: A function machine has a rule that ""subtracts 1"". If the input value is 8, students with this misconception may think that the output value is 9, rather than realizing that the output value is actually 7 (since 8 - 1 = 7).
* Case 3: A function graph shows a linear relationship between the input values (x-axis) and output values (y-axis). Students with this misconception may mistakenly interpret the y-axis values as the input values and the x-axis values as the output values."
2390,"Believes rounding to 1 significant figure means rounding to the nearest integer, regardless of the value of the number","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of significant figures and rounding. They may believe that rounding to 1 significant figure means rounding to the nearest whole number, without considering the actual value of the number. This can lead to incorrect rounding, especially for numbers that are very large or very small. 

For example, when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: The number 0.85 is to be rounded to 1 significant figure. A student with this misconception may round it to 1, instead of 0.9.
- Case 2: The number 2345 is to be rounded to 1 significant figure. A student with this misconception may round it to 2345 (no change), instead of 2000.
- Case 3: The number 0.0098 is to be rounded to 1 significant figure. A student with this misconception may round it to 0, instead of 0.01."
2391,"Believes the median is the middle category in a table, ignoring the frequencies","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly identify the median as the middle category or value in a table, without considering the frequencies or the actual data distribution. They tend to focus solely on the categories or values listed, disregarding the number of times each value occurs. As a result, they incorrectly assume the median is the middle category, rather than finding the middle value of the actual data set.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- A student is given a frequency table with exam scores and asked to find the median score. Instead of calculating the total number of scores and finding the middle value, they simply look for the middle score category in the table.
- A student is analyzing data on the number of hours spent watching TV per day and is presented with a table showing the number of hours and the corresponding frequencies. They might assume the median is the middle hour category (e.g., 2-3 hours) without considering the actual number of people watching TV for each hour category.
- A student is working with a dataset on the favorite colors of students in their class, and they are asked to find the median number of students who prefer a particular color. Instead of arranging the data in order and finding the middle value, they might incorrectly identify the median as the middle color category in the table."
2392,Rounds to the wrong degree of accuracy (rounds too much),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to round numbers to a specific degree of accuracy, but they round the number to a greater degree of accuracy than requested. This can happen when students misunderstand the concept of rounding or are overly focused on obtaining a precise answer, even when it's not necessary.

For example:

* When asked to round 4.237 to one decimal place, a student might round it to 4.2, but then further round 4.2 to 4, resulting in an incorrect answer.
* When asked to estimate the length of an object to the nearest meter, a student might measure it to be 5.67 meters and then round it to 5.7 meters, instead of simply rounding to 6 meters.
* When asked to calculate the area of a room and round the answer to the nearest square meter, a student might calculate the area to be 12.456 square meters and then round it to 12.46 square meters, instead of rounding to 12 square meters.
* When asked to round a measurement of 0.0456 to two significant figures, a student might round it to 0.046, and then further round it to 0.05, or even 0.0."
2393,Believes the midpoint of grouped data is equivalent to the group width,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the midpoint of a group or class interval in grouped data is the same as the width of that group. They may think that the midpoint is simply the same as the range of values within the group, rather than understanding that it represents the middle value of the group.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the midpoint of a group with a range of 10-20, students may think the midpoint is 10 (the width of the group) rather than 15 (the actual midpoint).
- When working with a frequency table, students may calculate the midpoint of a group as the difference between the upper and lower bounds, rather than finding the average of the two bounds.
- When plotting a histogram, students may incorrectly label the midpoint of each group as the width of the group, rather than the actual midpoint value."
2394,Does not know the properties of an equilateral triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not aware of the unique characteristics of an equilateral triangle, which can lead to incorrect assumptions and conclusions. An equilateral triangle has three equal sides and three equal angles, each measuring 60 degrees. Students with this misconception may not recognize these properties, leading them to incorrectly solve problems or make false assumptions about the triangle's attributes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to identify or draw an equilateral triangle, students may draw a triangle with unequal sides or angles.
- When solving problems involving the perimeter or area of an equilateral triangle, students may not recognize that all sides are equal, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When asked to determine the angles of an equilateral triangle, students may not recall that each angle measures 60 degrees, leading to incorrect answers.
- When comparing equilateral triangles to other types of triangles, such as isosceles or scalene triangles, students may not recognize the distinct properties of an equilateral triangle.
- When solving problems involving symmetry or tessellations, students may not recognize the unique properties of equilateral triangles, leading to incorrect conclusions."
2395,"When asked for the value of a digit, just gives the digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the value of a specific digit within a number, but they simply provide the digit itself without considering its place value. For instance, if asked to find the value of the digit '4' in the number 456, students with this misconception would simply answer '4', not recognizing that the '4' actually represents 400 in this context.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When reading numbers with multiple digits, students might not understand that each digit's value depends on its position.
- When comparing numbers, students might not consider the place value of each digit, leading to incorrect comparisons.
- When performing arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, students might not account for the place value of each digit, resulting in calculation errors.
- When solving problems involving money or measurements, students might not recognize the importance of place value in determining the correct amount or quantity.
- When working with decimals or percentages, students might not understand how the place value of each digit affects the overall value."
2396,Adds a zero onto the end of units multiplied by units when solving multiplication problems using the grid method,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using the grid method to solve multiplication problems involving units (e.g., 3 x 4, where both numbers are in units). They mistakenly add a zero to the end of the product, treating the units as if they were tens. This results in an incorrect answer with an extra zero at the end. For example, in the problem 3 x 4, the student would write the answer as 120 instead of 12.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Multiplying single-digit numbers with single-digit numbers (e.g., 5 x 6)
- Multiplying single-digit numbers with multi-digit numbers (e.g., 3 x 14)
- Multiplying multi-digit numbers with multi-digit numbers (e.g., 24 x 15)
- Solving word problems involving multiplication of units (e.g., ""If I have 3 groups of 4 pencils, how many pencils do I have in total?"")"
2397,Does not realise we can find a missing length if we know the base of a parallelogram and its area. ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to connect the relationship between the area of a parallelogram and its base and height. They may understand that the area of a parallelogram is given by the formula A = bh, but they fail to recognize that if the area and base are known, the height (or the missing length) can be calculated by rearranging the formula.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When solving problems involving parallelograms with known areas and bases, but unknown heights or lengths.
- In real-world applications, like building design or carpentry, where knowing the area and base of a parallelogram is not enough to determine the missing length.
- When comparing the areas of different parallelograms with the same base, but different heights, and not realizing that the height can be calculated if the area is known.
- In word problems that involve finding the missing length of a parallelogram given its area and base, such as finding the height of a parallelogram-shaped garden bed with a known area and base."
2398,Thinks you can divide terms by different factors when simplifying an algebraic fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that they can simplify an algebraic fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by different factors, rather than a common factor. They may think that as long as they are dividing, the fraction will be simplified, without realizing that the division must be by the same factor for both the numerator and the denominator to maintain the fraction's value.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying a fraction with multiple variables, students may try to divide one variable in the numerator by a factor, while dividing a different variable in the denominator by a different factor.
- When dealing with fractions that have both numbers and variables, students may attempt to divide the numerical part of the numerator by one factor, while dividing the variable part of the denominator by another factor.
- When faced with a complex fraction that involves multiple terms, students may try to simplify each term separately, using different factors for each term, rather than looking for a common factor that can be applied to the entire fraction."
2399,"when dividing a fraction by an integer, both multiplies the denominator and divides the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing a fraction by an integer. They may incorrectly believe that to divide a fraction by an integer, they need to multiply the denominator of the fraction by the integer and also divide the denominator by the integer, rather than just multiplying the denominator by the integer. This shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between division and multiplication of fractions.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When dividing 1/2 by 3, students may incorrectly think they need to multiply 2 by 3 and then divide 2 by 3, rather than just multiplying 2 by 3 to get 1/6.
- When dividing 3/4 by 2, students may incorrectly think they need to multiply 4 by 2 and then divide 4 by 2, rather than just multiplying 4 by 2 to get 3/8.
- When dividing 2/3 by 5, students may incorrectly think they need to multiply 3 by 5 and then divide 3 by 5, rather than just multiplying 3 by 5 to get 2/15."
2400,"Believes that if the numerators of 2 fractions are equal then the fractions are equal, regardless of the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students focus solely on the numerators of fractions and overlook the importance of the denominators in determining the value of a fraction. They believe that if the numerators of two fractions are the same, then the fractions are equal, disregarding the fact that the denominators may be different.

For example, a student with this misconception may think that:

* 2/3 is equal to 2/5 because they both have the same numerator (2), even though the denominators (3 and 5) are different.
* 3/4 is equal to 3/6 because they both have the same numerator (3), despite the fact that the denominators (4 and 6) are not the same.
* 1/2 is equal to 1/4 because they both have the same numerator (1), ignoring the difference in denominators (2 and 4).

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When comparing fractions in a math problem, a student may incorrectly conclude that two fractions are equal just because they have the same numerator.
* When simplifying fractions, a student may not recognize that the simplified fraction is not equal to the original fraction if the denominator changes.
* When solving real-world problems involving fractions, such as measuring ingredients for a recipe or dividing a pizza, a student may make errors if they fail to consider the denominators of the fractions."
2401,Answers as if there are 60 hours in a day,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 60 hours in a day instead of 24 hours. They may think that since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there must be 60 hours in a day. This error is often due to a misunderstanding of time units and how they relate to each other.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When calculating elapsed time: A student might think that if an event lasts for 2 hours, it is 2/60 of a day instead of 2/24.
- When converting between time units: A student may convert 3 hours to minutes correctly (3 x 60 = 180 minutes) but then assume that this is 3/60 of a day instead of 3/24.
- When solving problems involving time rates: If a water tank can fill up in 4 hours, a student with this misconception might think that the rate is 1/60 of the tank per hour instead of 1/4 of the tank per 6 hours (or 1/24 of the tank per hour).
- When interpreting time-based data: A student may misinterpret a graph showing data over a 24-hour period, thinking that each hour represents 1/60 of the total time instead of 1/24."
2402,"When asked for the value of a digit, gives an answer 10 times too small","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of place value in a multi-digit number. They tend to overlook the fact that each digit's value is determined by its position in the number. For example, in the number 456, the 4 represents 400, not just 4. When asked to find the value of a specific digit, students with this misconception may simply state the digit itself, rather than its actual value based on its position.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to find the value of the digit 5 in the number 507, the student responds with ""5"" instead of ""500"".
* When asked to find the value of the digit 8 in the number 814, the student responds with ""8"" instead of ""800"".
* When asked to find the value of the digit 3 in the number 3542, the student responds with ""3"" instead of ""3000""."
2403,Believes the columns in a base are multiples not powers of the base,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of place value in different number bases. They think that each column in a base represents a multiple of the base rather than a power of the base. For example, in base 10, they might believe that the tens column represents 10 times the base (10 x 1) and the hundreds column represents 20 times the base (10 x 2), rather than 10^1 and 10^2 respectively.

This misconception can lead to errors when converting numbers from one base to another, performing arithmetic operations in different bases, or understanding the concept of place value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting a number from base 2 to base 10, a student might think that the second column from the right represents 2 x 2 rather than 2^1.
- When performing addition or subtraction in base 5, a student might think that the third column from the right represents 5 x 3 rather than 5^2.
- When comparing numbers in different bases, a student might think that the value of a number in base 8 is calculated by multiplying each digit by a multiple of 8, rather than by powers of 8."
2404,"When using the capture-recapture method of sampling, believes you multiply the number marked first by the number marked second to get the best estimate of population size","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the formula used in the capture-recapture method of sampling. They incorrectly believe that by multiplying the number of individuals marked in the first capture by the number of individuals marked in the second capture, they will obtain the best estimate of the population size. This error likely stems from a misunderstanding of the actual formula, which involves using the ratio of marked to total individuals in the second capture to estimate the population size.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is asked to estimate the population size of a rabbit population using the capture-recapture method. They mark 20 rabbits in the first capture and 15 rabbits in the second capture, with 5 rabbits being recaptured. They then calculate the population size as 20 x 15 = 300.
- In a class activity, students are simulating the capture-recapture method using a small population of ""animals"" (e.g., beads or tokens). They mark a certain number of animals in the first capture and a different number in the second capture. When asked to estimate the population size, they multiply the two numbers together.
- A student is working on a project to estimate the population size of a local fish population using the capture-recapture method. They collect data on the number of fish marked in the first and second captures but incorrectly apply the formula, multiplying the two numbers together to obtain an estimate."
2405,Arithmetic error when dividing by 8,"Explanation: A common misconception that students may have is making arithmetic errors when dividing by 8. This can occur when students are not familiar with the division facts of 8 or when they misapply the rules of division. For instance, some students may mistakenly think that dividing by 8 is the same as dividing by 2 and then dividing the result by 4, or they may simply struggle with recalling the multiplication facts of 8, leading to incorrect quotients.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When asked to divide 24 by 8, a student may incorrectly answer 4 instead of 3, because they may mistakenly think that 8 x 4 = 24.
- When solving a problem that involves dividing a multi-digit number by 8, a student may make a calculation error, such as dividing 48 by 8 and getting 5 instead of 6.
- When working with fractions or decimals that involve eighths, a student may incorrectly simplify or convert them due to their misunderstanding of division by 8.
- When solving real-world problems that involve dividing quantities into groups of 8, such as arranging objects into boxes that hold 8 items each, a student may make errors in their calculations due to their misconception about dividing by 8."
2406,"When multiplying a fraction by an integer, believes the integer will become the denominator of the fraction","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying a fraction by an integer. They mistakenly assume that the integer will become the new denominator of the fraction, rather than understanding that the integer is being multiplied by the numerator of the fraction, with the denominator remaining the same. This misconception can be attributed to a lack of understanding of the concept of equivalent ratios and the effect of multiplication on fractions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When multiplying a fraction by a whole number in word problems, such as ""Tom has 1/4 of a pizza and he wants to buy 3 pizzas, how much pizza will he have in total?""
- When simplifying expressions involving the multiplication of fractions and integers, such as 2 * 3/4
- When solving problems involving proportions and equivalent ratios, such as ""A recipe requires 1/2 cup of flour to make 2 cookies, how much flour is needed to make 6 cookies?"""
2407,Believes an arithmetic sequence can have a common second difference rather than first difference,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that an arithmetic sequence is defined by a common difference between every other term (i.e., a common second difference) rather than a common difference between consecutive terms (i.e., a first difference). They may incorrectly assume that as long as the difference between every other term is constant, the sequence is arithmetic.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify sequences as arithmetic and make errors when working with them.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- When identifying whether a given sequence is arithmetic or not. For example, given the sequence 2, 5, 9, 14, 20, a student with this misconception may incorrectly identify it as an arithmetic sequence because the difference between every other term (e.g., 5-2 = 3 and 9-5 = 4, but 14-9 = 5 and 20-14 = 6 have a common second difference of +1) appears to be related.
- When generating arithmetic sequences. A student with this misconception may generate a sequence with a common second difference rather than a common first difference, resulting in a sequence that is not actually arithmetic.
- When solving problems that involve finding the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. If a student has this misconception, they may use the wrong formula or approach to find the nth term, leading to incorrect answers."
2408,Does not realise that subtracting a larger number will give a smaller answer,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the concept of subtraction as finding the difference between two numbers. They may mistakenly believe that the result of subtraction is solely dependent on the first number, without considering the value of the number being subtracted. As a result, they may think that subtracting a larger number will give a larger answer, or that the size of the number being subtracted does not impact the result.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* Case 1: When subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, e.g., 5 - 8. Students may think that the answer will be greater than 5, rather than being a negative number.
* Case 2: When comparing the results of subtracting different numbers from the same initial value, e.g., 10 - 3 vs. 10 - 6. Students may believe that both subtractions will result in the same or similar answers, rather than recognizing that subtracting 6 will give a smaller answer than subtracting 3.
* Case 3: When solving word problems that involve subtraction, e.g., ""Tom has 15 pencils and gives 8 to his friend. How many pencils does Tom have left?"" Students may mistakenly think that Tom has more pencils left if he gives away more pencils."
2409,Believes you place the digits next to each other for a multiplication sample space diagram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to create a sample space diagram for a multiplication problem, such as 3 x 4. They incorrectly believe that they need to list all the possible combinations of the two numbers by placing the digits next to each other, resulting in an incorrect sample space diagram. For example, they might list the combinations as 34, 43, 3, 4, 33, 44, etc. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the concept of multiplication and sample space diagrams, which are used to visualize and count the possible outcomes of an event.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When asked to create a sample space diagram for a simple multiplication problem, such as 2 x 3.
* When dealing with real-life scenarios that involve multiplication, such as counting the number of ways to arrange objects in rows and columns.
* When trying to solve problems that involve finding the total number of possible outcomes in a given situation, such as the number of ways to choose a sandwich and a drink from a menu."
2410,Believes an outlier has to be a whole number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that an outlier, which is a value that lies significantly outside the range of the majority of the data set, must be a whole number. They may believe that only whole numbers can be considered outliers, and that decimal numbers or fractions cannot be outliers. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of what constitutes an outlier, or from a lack of exposure to data sets that include non-whole number values.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When analyzing a data set of exam scores, a student identifies the outlier as the highest or lowest whole number score, ignoring the possibility of a score that is a decimal value (e.g., 85.5).
- In a data set of measurements, such as the heights of students in a class, a student may disregard a measurement that is not a whole number (e.g., 1.65 meters) as a potential outlier.
- When graphing a set of data, a student may incorrectly assume that only whole number values can be outliers, ignoring any data points that are not whole numbers, even if they are significantly far away from the rest of the data."
2411,"When multiplying large numbers, splits numbers into addends rather than factors","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying large numbers and they incorrectly break down the numbers into parts to be added together, rather than factoring them into smaller components to be multiplied. For example, when multiplying 43 and 27, a student with this misconception may break down the problem into (40 + 3) + (20 + 7) and then incorrectly add these parts together, rather than recognizing that the numbers can be factored into (40 + 3) × (20 + 7) and then applying the distributive property of multiplication.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying multi-digit numbers, e.g. 43 × 27 or 94 × 35
- Solving real-world problems that involve multiplication of large numbers, e.g. calculating the cost of items purchased in bulk
- Solving word problems that involve scaling or resizing, e.g. ""If a bookshelf has 5 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 boxes, how many boxes can the bookshelf hold in total if there are 3 bookshelves?"""
2412,Does not understand which place value is the one that determines if a number rounds up or down,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unsure about the rules of rounding numbers. They may believe that any non-zero digit in the number determines whether it rounds up or down, rather than understanding that it is the digit immediately to the right of the place value being rounded to that determines whether to round up or down.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- Rounding 43.25 to the nearest whole number: The student may look at the 2 in the tenths place and think it's the deciding factor, rather than the 5 in the hundredths place.
- Rounding 987.654 to the nearest hundred: The student may look at the 7 in the tens place and think it's the deciding factor, rather than the 6 in the tens place and then the 5 in the ones place is not what they need, they actually need to check the 4 in the tenths place is not what they need, they actually need to check the 6 in the ones place and the 5 in the tenths place is not what they need, they actually need to check the 6 in the ones place and then the 4 in the tenths place is not what they need, they actually need to check the 5 in the ones place is not the deciding factor they actually need the 6 and then they need to check the 4 in the hundredths and then the 5 in the thousandths is not the deciding factor but actually 4 in the tenths and then they actually need the 5, they actually need the 6. 
- Rounding 235.1 to the nearest ten: The student may look at the 3 in the tens place and think it's the deciding factor, rather than the 5 in the ones place."
2413,"When finding the value of a number given in roman numerals, adds the value of all letters together without considering the position of the letter.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to Roman numerals but do not fully understand the rules governing their use. In Roman numerals, each letter has a specific value, but the position of the letter can change its value. Students with this misconception fail to recognize that when a smaller value letter appears before a larger value letter, it means subtraction, not addition. They simply add the values of all the letters together, ignoring the positional relationship between them.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When converting IV (4) to a number, the student will add 1 (I) and 5 (V) to get 6 instead of subtracting 1 from 5 to get 4.
- When converting IX (9) to a number, the student will add 1 (I) and 10 (X) to get 11 instead of subtracting 1 from 10 to get 9.
- When converting XL (40) to a number, the student will add 10 (X) and 50 (L) to get 60 instead of subtracting 10 from 50 to get 40."
2414,Believes a variable must remain unknown and cannot be substituted with a value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a variable in an algebraic expression or equation is a mysterious entity that must remain unknown at all times. They may think that assigning a specific value to the variable would somehow violate the rules of algebra or make the equation invalid. This misunderstanding can lead students to struggle with substituting values into equations, solving for unknowns, or interpreting the results of algebraic manipulations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When solving linear equations, students may resist substituting a value for the variable, even if it is given, and instead try to manipulate the equation to isolate the variable without using the given value.
* In graphing linear or quadratic functions, students might believe that the variable x must always be a mystery and not a specific value, making it difficult for them to understand the relationship between the variable and the corresponding y-values.
* When working with word problems involving variables, students may hesitate to assign a specific value to the variable, even if the problem provides enough information to do so, and instead try to solve the problem using only algebraic manipulations.
* In algebraic proofs or derivations, students might think that using specific values for variables would make the proof or derivation less general or less valid, rather than recognizing that substituting values can help to illustrate or verify the result."
2415,Thinks that square root is found by dividing by 4,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of square roots and mistakenly believe that finding the square root of a number involves dividing it by a fixed number, in this case, 4. They may think that the square root operation is a simple division operation, rather than a process of finding a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are first introduced to square roots and are trying to make sense of the concept, but have not fully grasped the underlying mathematics.
- When students are faced with simple square root problems, such as finding the square root of 16, and mistakenly think that dividing 16 by 4 gives the correct answer (which, coincidentally, is 4 in this case, but not due to the division operation).
- When students are dealing with more complex problems involving square roots, such as solving equations or manipulating algebraic expressions, and their misunderstanding of the square root operation leads to incorrect solutions.
- When students are working with real-world applications of square roots, such as finding the length of a side of a square, and their misconception leads to incorrect calculations and answers."
2416,Finds the difference in a coordinate pair rather than the midpoint,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the midpoint of a line segment given two coordinates. Instead of using the midpoint formula, students mistakenly find the difference between the x-coordinates and the difference between the y-coordinates, thinking that this will give them the midpoint. They may understand that they need to find a point that is ""in the middle"" of the two given points, but they incorrectly interpret this as finding the difference between the coordinates rather than finding the average.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When finding the midpoint of a line segment with coordinates (2, 3) and (4, 5), a student might find the difference between the x-coordinates (4 - 2 = 2) and the difference between the y-coordinates (5 - 3 = 2) and think that the midpoint is (2, 2).
- When asked to find the midpoint of a line segment with coordinates (-3, 2) and (5, 6), a student might find the difference between the x-coordinates (5 - (-3) = 8) and the difference between the y-coordinates (6 - 2 = 4) and think that the midpoint is (8, 4).
- When solving problems involving shapes, such as finding the midpoint of a diagonal in a rectangle or the midpoint of a line segment in a triangle, students might apply this misconception and arrive at an incorrect answer."
2417,Does not use the associative property of multiplication to find other factors of a number,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize that the order in which they multiply numbers does not affect the result. They may not realize that they can rearrange the factors of a multiplication problem to find other factors of a number. This means that students may struggle to identify all the possible factors of a given number, as they are not using the associative property to their advantage.

For example, if students are asked to find the factors of 12, they might only think of 1 x 12 and 2 x 6, without considering that 3 x 4 is also a valid factorization. This limited thinking can hinder their ability to find all the factors of a number.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

* When finding factors of a given number, such as 24 or 36.
* When solving multiplication problems that involve multiple factors, such as 3 x 4 x 5.
* When simplifying expressions that involve multiplication, such as 2 x 3 x 4.
* When solving real-world problems that involve finding factors, such as dividing a group of objects into equal parts.
* When exploring the concept of prime factorization and identifying all the prime factors of a number."
2418,Believes the universal set symbol means any elements not within a circle. ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the meaning of the universal set symbol in Venn diagrams, which is typically represented by a rectangle. They incorrectly believe that any elements outside the circles within the rectangle represent elements not within a circle, rather than understanding that the rectangle represents the entire universal set and elements within it but outside the circles are those that do not belong to the specific sets represented by the circles.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to identify elements that belong to the universal set but not to specific subsets, they may incorrectly identify elements outside the circles as being outside the universal set.
- When students are given a problem with multiple overlapping circles in a Venn diagram, they may become confused about which elements belong to the universal set and which do not.
- When students are asked to draw their own Venn diagrams to represent sets and subsets, they may incorrectly place elements outside the universal set rectangle or misinterpret the meaning of the space outside the circles.
- When students are given word problems involving sets and subsets, they may misinterpret the universal set as only including elements within the circles, rather than understanding that it includes all elements under consideration."
2419,Combines digits instead of applying the mathematical function,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the concept of place value and mathematical operations, leading them to simply combine or concatenate digits instead of applying the correct mathematical function. For instance, when asked to add or multiply numbers, they might just join the numbers together, ignoring the mathematical operation. This could be due to a lack of understanding of the mathematical symbols, the concept of place value, or the procedures for performing mathematical operations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to add 14 + 25, and they respond with 1425.
- A student is asked to multiply 3 × 4, and they respond with 34.
- A student is asked to subtract 15 - 7, and they respond with 157.
- A student is asked to divide 12 ÷ 3, and they respond with 123.
- A student is asked to calculate 2 × 10, and they respond with 210."
2420,Thinks direct proportion rules apply to inverse proportion problems,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize the difference between direct and inverse proportion relationships. In direct proportion, as one variable increases, the other variable increases at a constant rate. However, in inverse proportion, as one variable increases, the other variable decreases, and vice versa, while their product remains constant.

Students with this misconception may apply the rules of direct proportion (e.g., multiplying both variables by the same factor) to inverse proportion problems, leading to incorrect solutions. They may also incorrectly assume that a linear or straight-line relationship exists between the variables in an inverse proportion scenario.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is given a problem where the cost of tickets to a concert is inversely proportional to the number of tickets purchased. They may assume that if the number of tickets is doubled, the cost will also double, instead of decreasing.
- Case 2: In a problem involving the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas, a student may think that if the pressure is tripled, the volume will also triple, instead of decreasing to one-third of its original value.
- Case 3: When analyzing the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to complete a task, a student may believe that if the number of workers is quadrupled, the time taken will also be quadrupled, instead of being reduced to one-quarter of the original time."
2421,Believes a rectangle has one pair of equal sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of the properties of a rectangle. They may recognize that a rectangle has two pairs of sides, but mistakenly believe that only one pair of opposite sides are equal in length, rather than understanding that both pairs of opposite sides are equal. This could be due to a lack of exposure to various shapes and their properties or an incomplete grasp of the definition of a rectangle.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify the properties of different shapes, they may incorrectly state that a rectangle only has one pair of equal sides.
- When solving problems that involve finding the perimeter or area of a rectangle, students may only consider one pair of equal sides, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When comparing and classifying different shapes, students may incorrectly group rectangles with other shapes that only have one pair of equal sides, such as trapezoids.
- When asked to draw or construct a rectangle, students may draw a shape with only one pair of equal sides, demonstrating their misunderstanding of the shape's properties."
2422,Tries to add or subtract unlike terms,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that they can directly add or subtract terms with different variables or coefficients, without realizing that the terms need to have the same variable(s) and coefficient(s) to be combined.

For example, a student with this misconception may try to simplify the expression:

2x + 3y = ?

By incorrectly adding the terms, they might write:

2x + 3y = 5xy or 2x + 3y = 5x or 5y

This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the rules for combining like terms in algebra. 

Some short cases when the misconception will occur include:

- Simplifying expressions with multiple terms (e.g., 2x + 3y + 2z)
- Solving linear equations with variables on both sides (e.g., 2x + 3 = x + 4)
- Working with algebraic expressions in word problems (e.g., Tom has 2x boxes of pens and 3y boxes of pencils. How many boxes does he have in total?)"
2423,Confuses isosceles and scalene triangles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between isosceles and scalene triangles. An isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length, whereas a scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths. Students may mistakenly identify an isosceles triangle as scalene or vice versa due to incorrect identification of side lengths or angles.

This misconception may arise due to a lack of understanding of the definitions of these types of triangles, or because students are relying too heavily on visual appearances rather than precise measurements.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When drawing or identifying triangles with similar side lengths, students may incorrectly assume that two sides are equal, leading them to misclassify a scalene triangle as isosceles.
- When given a triangle with two sides of almost equal length, students may round the lengths to the nearest whole number, causing them to mistakenly identify a scalene triangle as isosceles.
- In problems involving right-angled triangles, students may assume that any right-angled triangle with two sides of different lengths is scalene, without checking if the two shorter sides are actually equal.
- When working with triangles in real-world contexts, such as building design or art, students may misidentify the type of triangle due to visual distortions or measurement errors."
2424,Believes a line segment can be opposite an axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of axes and line segments in geometry, specifically in graphing and coordinate systems. They may think that a line segment can be directly opposite an axis, such as the x-axis or y-axis, which is not the case. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definitions of axes and line segments, or from difficulties in visualizing and interpreting geometric shapes in a coordinate plane.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to identify or draw the coordinates of a line segment on a graph, a student may incorrectly place the line segment directly opposite the x-axis or y-axis.
- When solving problems involving reflection or symmetry, a student may mistakenly assume that a line segment can be reflected directly across an axis, rather than understanding that the reflection occurs over the axis.
- In problems involving the calculation of distances or lengths of line segments, a student with this misconception may incorrectly calculate the distance between two points, thinking that the line segment can be directly opposite an axis."
2425,"Believes both solutions of a quadratic will have the same absolute value, even when the graph is not symmetrical about the y axis","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that the two solutions of a quadratic equation will always have the same absolute value, regardless of the position of the graph. They might think that if one solution is x = a, then the other solution must be x = -a. This misconception is likely rooted in the fact that some quadratic equations, such as x^2 = 4, do have solutions with the same absolute value (x = 2 and x = -2). However, this is not a universal property of all quadratic equations.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When solving quadratic equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where students assume the two solutions will always be equidistant from the origin.
- When graphing quadratic functions, where students expect the graph to be symmetrical about the y-axis, even if the equation does not have the form y = ax^2.
- When finding the roots of a quadratic equation, where students might assume that if one root is a certain distance from the origin, the other root must be the same distance in the opposite direction."
2426,When finding the median from a even dataset does not understand we must find the midpoint of the two values in the middle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are calculating the median of a dataset with an even number of values. They may incorrectly assume that the median is one of the two middle values, rather than understanding that the median is the midpoint of these two values. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the definition of the median as the middle value in an ordered dataset, and how this definition is applied to datasets with an even number of values.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is given a dataset such as {2, 4, 6, 8} and they choose either 4 or 6 as the median, rather than calculating the midpoint of 4 and 6, which is 5.
- When a student is asked to find the median of a dataset such as {1, 3, 5, 7} and they select either 3 or 5 as the median, rather than calculating the midpoint of 3 and 5, which is 4.
- When a student is given a dataset with a larger number of values, such as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, and they incorrectly identify the median as either 3 or 4, rather than calculating the midpoint of 3 and 4, which is 3.5."
2427,Does not divide by 2 when finding midpoint,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the midpoint of a line segment or an interval, but they fail to divide the total length or the sum of the coordinates by 2. The students may simply add the coordinates or the lengths of the endpoints and think that the result is the midpoint. This shows a lack of understanding of the midpoint formula and its significance in geometry and other areas of mathematics.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Finding the midpoint of a line segment on a coordinate plane: A student may add the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of the endpoints, but forget to divide the sum by 2.
- Calculating the midpoint of an interval on a number line: A student may add the endpoints of the interval, but not divide the result by 2 to get the midpoint.
- Determining the midpoint of a line segment in a real-world application: For example, a student may be asked to find the midpoint of a room that is 12 meters long, and they may answer 12 meters (which is the total length) instead of 6 meters (which is the midpoint)."
2428,"When drawing bar diagram for ratio, shows the total amount as the total of one side","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of ratios and how they should be represented visually in a bar diagram. In a ratio, the total amount is often divided into parts, and each part represents a proportion of the whole. However, some students may incorrectly assume that the total amount is equal to the quantity of one part, rather than the sum of all the parts.

For instance, if a ratio is 3:5, students may draw a bar diagram where the total length of the bar represents 3 or 5 units, rather than 8 units (the sum of 3 and 5). This can lead to a distorted representation of the ratio and make it difficult for students to accurately compare and analyze the proportions.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- A recipe requires a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar, and students are asked to draw a bar diagram to represent the ratio. They may incorrectly show the total amount as 2 cups or 3 cups, rather than 5 cups.
- A group of students are sharing a bag of candies in a ratio of 1:2:3, and they are asked to draw a bar diagram to show the distribution. They may incorrectly represent the total amount as 1, 2, or 3, rather than 6 (the sum of 1, 2, and 3).
- A farmer has a ratio of 5 sheep to 7 goats, and students are asked to draw a bar diagram to represent the ratio. They may incorrectly show the total amount as 5 or 7, rather than 12 (the sum of 5 and 7)."
2429,Believes finding a fraction of an amount means multiplying by the denominator,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of finding a fraction of an amount. They mistakenly believe that to find a fraction of an amount, they need to multiply the amount by the denominator (the number of parts the whole is divided into) instead of the fraction itself. This shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the numerator and denominator in a fraction and how they relate to finding parts of a whole.

For example, if a pizza is divided into 8 slices and a student is asked to find 1/8 of the pizza, they might multiply the total number of slices by 8 (the denominator) instead of realizing that 1/8 is already one of the equal parts.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A recipe requires 3/4 cup of sugar. The student might multiply the total amount of sugar by 4 instead of finding 3/4 of the cup.
- A bookshelf has 12 shelves, and 1/3 of them are filled with books. The student might multiply 12 by 3 instead of finding 1/3 of 12.
- A person has £15 and wants to spend 2/5 of it. The student might multiply £15 by 5 instead of finding 2/5 of £15."
2430,Does not consider fractional parts when solving proportion problems,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with proportion problems that involve fractional or decimal relationships, but they tend to focus only on whole number relationships. They might ignore or misunderstand the fractional parts, leading to incorrect solutions. For instance, when scaling up or down in proportion problems, students might only multiply or divide whole numbers, neglecting to adjust the fractional parts accordingly.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* When working with equivalent ratios, students might ignore the fractional parts and only focus on the whole number parts, resulting in incorrect equivalent ratios.
* When scaling up or down in proportion problems, students might multiply or divide only the whole numbers, without adjusting the fractional parts, leading to incorrect solutions.
* When working with percentages, students might ignore the fractional parts and only focus on the whole number percentages, resulting in incorrect calculations.
* When solving problems involving proportions with mixed numbers (e.g., 2 1/2), students might neglect to consider the fractional part, leading to incorrect solutions.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

* A recipe for making cookies calls for a ratio of 2 3/4 cups of flour to 1 cup of sugar. If a student wants to make half the recipe, they might only divide the whole numbers (2 and 1) without adjusting the fractional part (3/4), resulting in an incorrect ratio.
* A student is asked to find 3/4 of a number, but they only multiply the whole number part, ignoring the fractional part.
* A student is working with a proportion problem that involves a ratio of 1 1/2 to 2 3/4. They might only focus on the whole number parts (1 and 2) and ignore the fractional parts (1/2 and 3/4), leading to an incorrect solution."
2431,"When two digits multiply to 10 or more during a multiplication problem, does not add one to the preceding digit","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are performing multiplication calculations, particularly with multi-digit numbers. When multiplying two digits together results in a product of 10 or more, some students fail to understand the concept of carrying over or regrouping. They may write the product as a two-digit number, but neglect to add 1 to the preceding digit, which is necessary to correctly represent the result of the multiplication.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. 43 x 7: When multiplying 3 and 7, students get 21, but fail to add 1 to the tens place when writing the result.
2. 94 x 5: When multiplying 4 and 5, students get 20, but neglect to carry the 2 over to the hundreds place.
3. 27 x 9: When multiplying 7 and 9, students get 63, but forget to add 1 to the tens place when writing the result."
2432,Does not know the properties of a parallelogram,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify or recall the key characteristics and properties that define a parallelogram. A parallelogram is a type of quadrilateral with specific properties, but students with this misconception may not understand that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length, opposite angles are equal, consecutive angles are supplementary, and diagonals bisect each other. They may also struggle to recognize that a parallelogram's opposite sides are parallel, which is a fundamental characteristic of this geometric shape.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in various geometric tasks, such as:

- Identifying and classifying quadrilaterals
- Finding the perimeter or area of a parallelogram
- Understanding the relationships between different parts of a parallelogram

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: When asked to identify the type of quadrilateral with opposite sides of equal length, a student with this misconception may not recognize it as a parallelogram.
- Case 2: When tasked with finding the area of a parallelogram, a student may not know that the area is equal to the base multiplied by the height, due to a lack of understanding of the properties of a parallelogram.
- Case 3: When given a diagram of a parallelogram with labeled angles, a student with this misconception may not be able to determine the measure of the consecutive angles."
2433,Does not know how to calculate with exchange rates,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to understand the concept of exchange rates and how to apply them in calculations. They may find it challenging to convert between different currencies, often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the exchange rate and the currencies involved. This can lead to incorrect calculations, such as multiplying instead of dividing, or vice versa, when converting between currencies.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A student is traveling from the US to the UK and wants to exchange $100 for pounds. If the exchange rate is 1 USD = 0.80 GBP, they may incorrectly calculate the exchange by multiplying $100 by 0.80, resulting in £80, instead of dividing $100 by 1 and then multiplying by 0.80.
* Case 2: A student is comparing the prices of a product in different countries. If a product costs €50 in Europe and the exchange rate is 1 EUR = 1.20 USD, they may incorrectly calculate the price in dollars by multiplying €50 by 1, resulting in $50, instead of multiplying €50 by 1.20.
* Case 3: A student is converting between two currencies that are not their native currency. For example, if they are converting from yen to euros, and the exchange rates are 1 JPY = 0.008 EUR and 1 EUR = 125 JPY, they may become confused about which rate to use and how to apply it, leading to incorrect calculations."
2434,Ignores position/value of midpoint when trying to label a point on scale,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with scales, graphs, or number lines and are asked to label a point or read a value between two marked points. They tend to ignore the position or value of the midpoint, which is a crucial reference point that helps to accurately determine the value of the point in question. As a result, students may inaccurately label the point or read the value, often rounding to the nearest marked point or estimating without considering the midpoint.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- A student is asked to label a point on a number line that is halfway between 5 and 10, but they ignore the midpoint (7.5) and label it as 5 or 10.
- When reading a value from a graph, a student estimates a point to be at 15, ignoring the midpoint (12.5) between the marked points 10 and 15.
- A student is asked to plot a point on a scale that represents 3.5, but they ignore the midpoint (3.5) between 3 and 4, and plot it at 3 or 4 instead."
2435,Reads one point on a time series graph instead of all the values from a given time period,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to interpret data from a time series graph, but instead of analyzing the trend or pattern of the data over a specific time period, they focus on a single point on the graph. They may mistakenly believe that the value at one particular point represents the entire time period, rather than considering the overall trend or pattern of the data.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

* When asked to describe the trend in sales over a quarter, a student might only look at the sales figure for one specific month, instead of analyzing the overall pattern of sales over the entire quarter.
* When analyzing temperature data over a year, a student might focus on the temperature reading for a single day, rather than looking at the overall trend of temperature changes throughout the year.
* When comparing the growth rate of two different companies over a 5-year period, a student might only compare the growth rate at the end of the 5th year, instead of analyzing the trend of growth over the entire 5-year period."
2436,Believes the solutions of a quadratic equation are the constants in the factorised form,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the factorisation method of solving quadratic equations. They may mistakenly believe that the solutions (or roots) of the equation are the constants in the factorised form, rather than the values that make the equation true. For example, given the quadratic equation x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0, which factorises to (x + 3)(x + 2) = 0, students with this misconception may think that the solutions are 3 and 2, but they don't understand that these are the values that x is being added to, rather than the values of x itself.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are first introduced to factorisation as a method of solving quadratic equations, and they don't fully understand the relationship between the factorised form and the original equation.
* When students are asked to solve quadratic equations with more complex factorisations, such as (2x + 3)(x - 4) = 0, and they mistakenly identify the constants 3 and 4 as the solutions.
* When students are given a quadratic equation in a different form, such as x^2 - 4 = 0, which can be factorised as (x - 2)(x + 2) = 0, and they don't recognise that the solutions are the values of x that make the equation true, rather than the constants in the factorised form."
2437,Believes a downward slope on a distance-time graph means travelling away,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret the slope of a distance-time graph. They mistakenly believe that a downward slope indicates movement away from a reference point, rather than recognizing that it actually represents a decrease in distance over time, which can mean travelling towards the reference point or a decrease in distance due to a change in direction or stopping. 

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- A ball is thrown upwards and is now returning to the ground, and its distance from the ground is decreasing over time.
- A person is walking towards a fixed point and their distance from that point is decreasing as time passes.
- An object is moving towards the origin (0,0) on a coordinate plane, resulting in a decrease in distance from the origin over time."
2438,Does not copy a given method accurately,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to replicate a mathematical procedure or algorithm that has been demonstrated to them, often due to a lack of understanding of the underlying concepts or a failure to pay attention to detail. As a result, they may inaccurately copy the method, leading to incorrect solutions.

This misconception can manifest in various areas of mathematics, including:

- Number: When performing multi-digit calculations, such as long division or multiplication, students may misalign numbers, forget to carry or borrow digits, or incorrectly apply mathematical operations.
- Algebra: When solving equations or manipulating expressions, students may incorrectly apply rules, forget to expand or simplify expressions, or misplace terms.
- Data and Statistics: When creating graphs or charts, students may incorrectly label axes, misinterpret data, or use the wrong scale.
- Geometry and Measure: When calculating perimeter, area, or volume, students may misapply formulas, forget to consider units, or incorrectly identify shapes.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

- A student is asked to multiply 456 by 27 using the standard multiplication algorithm, but they forget to carry over digits, resulting in an incorrect answer.
- A student is solving the equation 2x + 5 = 11 and forgets to subtract 5 from both sides, leading to an incorrect solution.
- A student is creating a bar chart to display data on the favorite colors of their classmates, but they incorrectly label the x-axis, making it difficult to interpret the data.
- A student is calculating the area of a rectangle, but they misapply the formula A = l × w, using the wrong values for length and width."
2439,Does not understand that removing an outlier will impact the range,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that removing an outlier from a dataset can significantly change the range of the data. The range is calculated as the difference between the highest and lowest values in the dataset. Outliers, by definition, are values that are significantly higher or lower than the majority of the data points. If an outlier is the highest or lowest value in the dataset, removing it will change the highest or lowest value, thus affecting the range.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When calculating the range of a dataset that includes an outlier, a student might think that removing the outlier won't change the range because they are focusing only on the majority of the data points, neglecting the impact of the outlier on the highest or lowest value.

- Case 2: When comparing the ranges of two datasets, one with an outlier and one without, a student might incorrectly assume that the ranges will be the same if the outlier is removed, failing to account for the change in the highest or lowest value.

- Case 3: In a real-world context, such as analyzing scores in a class, a student might think that removing an exceptionally high or low score won't affect the overall spread of the scores, not realizing that the range is directly affected by the inclusion or exclusion of such outliers."
2440,Finds the circumference instead of the area,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the area of a circle but instead calculate the circumference. The students may correctly recall the formula for the circumference of a circle (C = 2πr or C = πd) but incorrectly apply it when the question asks for the area. They may mistakenly think that the two formulas are interchangeable or that the circumference is the same as the area. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the different properties of a circle and the distinct formulas used to calculate them.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is given the radius of a circle and is asked to find its area, but they calculate the circumference instead using the formula C = 2πr.
- A student is given the diameter of a circle and is asked to find its area, but they calculate the circumference instead using the formula C = πd.
- A student is given a real-world problem, such as finding the area of a circular table or the area of a circular garden bed, but they calculate the circumference instead of the area."
2441,Thinks multiplying by a number is the same as raising to the power of that number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between the concept of multiplication and exponentiation. They may believe that multiplying a number by another number is equivalent to raising the first number to the power of the second number. For instance, they might think that 3 multiplied by 4 (3 × 4) is the same as 3 to the power of 4 (3^4). This confusion can stem from a lack of understanding of the fundamental properties and operations of arithmetic, particularly the distinct roles of multiplication and exponentiation.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with numerical expressions, such as 2 × 3 being mistaken for 2^3.
- When solving algebraic equations, where students may incorrectly apply the rules of exponentiation instead of multiplication.
- In word problems, where the context may involve repeated multiplication, leading students to incorrectly apply exponentiation.
- In geometric problems, such as calculating the area or volume of shapes, where students may mistakenly apply exponentiation instead of multiplication."
2442,"When calculating a scale factor, multiplies instead of dividing.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the scale factor between two similar shapes or objects. They may mistakenly multiply the measurements of the two objects instead of dividing them. This is often due to a misunderstanding of the concept of scale factor, which is a ratio of the size of the image to the size of the original object.

For example, if a student is given a diagram of two similar triangles, one with a side length of 6cm and the other with a side length of 12cm, they may multiply 6 and 12 to get 72, instead of dividing 12 by 6 to get a scale factor of 2.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Enlarging a photograph to fit a larger frame, where the student may multiply the dimensions of the original photo instead of dividing.
- Calculating the scale factor of a model building to its actual size, where the student may multiply the measurements instead of dividing.
- Determining the scale factor of a map to the actual distance, where the student may multiply the map measurements instead of dividing."
2443,Thinks y = ? is the x axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the equation y = ? represents the x-axis on a coordinate plane. They may think that any equation with y and a constant or variable on the other side of the equation is referring to the x-axis. This misunderstanding can be due to a lack of understanding of the x and y axes' roles in the coordinate plane or insufficient exposure to graphing and equation notation.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When graphing simple linear equations like y = 2 or y = x, students might incorrectly label the x-axis with the equation.
- When solving systems of equations, students may incorrectly substitute y = ? for the x-axis, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When working with functions and identifying x-intercepts, students may mistakenly think that the x-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the line y = ?."
2444,"When converting compound measures into different units, thinks you multiply when the unit of the divisor has become smaller","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting between different units of measurement, particularly with compound measures such as speed (e.g., miles per hour) or density (e.g., grams per cubic centimeter). They may mistakenly believe that when converting to a smaller unit of measurement in the divisor (the unit they are dividing by), they need to multiply the value instead of adjusting the division accordingly.

For instance, when converting 60 miles per hour to miles per minute, some students might think that since minutes are smaller than hours, they should multiply 60 by a certain factor (e.g., 60), resulting in an incorrect calculation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Converting 5 kilograms per liter to grams per milliliter: A student may think that since milliliters are smaller than liters, they need to multiply 5 kilograms by 1000 (since 1 liter = 1000 milliliters) instead of dividing it by 1000 to adjust for the change in units.
2. Converting 30 miles per hour to feet per second: A student might believe that since seconds are smaller than hours, they need to multiply 30 miles by a certain factor (e.g., 3600, since 1 hour = 3600 seconds) instead of adjusting the division accordingly.
3. Converting 2.5 grams per cubic centimeter to grams per milliliter: A student may think that since milliliters are smaller than cubic centimeters, they need to multiply 2.5 grams by 1 (since 1 cubic centimeter = 1 milliliter) instead of realizing that the units are equivalent in this case."
2445,Mixes up squaring and addition,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that squaring a number means adding the number to itself, rather than multiplying it by itself. For example, they might think that 3 squared (3²) is equal to 3 + 3, which is 6, instead of the correct answer, which is 3 multiplied by 3, or 9.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When calculating the area of a square, students might add the length of the sides instead of multiplying them. For instance, if a square has a side length of 4, they might think the area is 4 + 4, instead of 4², which is 16.
- When working with algebraic expressions, students might incorrectly simplify expressions like (x + 2)² as x + 2 + x + 2, instead of the correct expansion, which is x² + 4x + 4.
- When solving problems involving exponents, students might mistakenly apply the addition rule instead of the exponent rule, leading to incorrect answers. For example, they might think that 2³ is equal to 2 + 2 + 2, instead of the correct answer, which is 2 multiplied by itself three times, or 8."
2446,Believes the difference between triangle numbers decreases by 1 each time,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students observe the initial pattern of triangle numbers and mistakenly believe that the difference between consecutive triangle numbers decreases by 1 each time. Triangle numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number can be represented as a triangle with dots. The sequence starts as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, and so on.

The difference between the first few triangle numbers may seem to support this misconception:
- Between 1 and 3, the difference is 2.
- Between 3 and 6, the difference is 3.
- Between 6 and 10, the difference is 4.
- Between 10 and 15, the difference is 5.

However, students with this misconception may believe that this pattern of differences will continue to decrease by 1, which is not the case.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to find the next triangle number in a sequence, a student might incorrectly calculate the difference between the previous two numbers and then decrease it by 1.
2. In a pattern recognition question, a student may mistakenly identify a decreasing pattern in the differences between triangle numbers and incorrectly predict the next difference.
3. When solving a problem involving triangle numbers, a student may apply their misconception to simplify the calculation, leading to incorrect results."
2447,Believes the reciprocal button writes a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the reciprocal button on a calculator (usually denoted by 1/x) simply types or writes a fraction, rather than understanding its true function of calculating the reciprocal of a given number. The reciprocal of a number is 1 divided by that number. For instance, students might think that pressing the reciprocal button will simply display the number as a fraction (e.g., 4 becomes 4/1) rather than actually calculating its reciprocal (which would be 1/4). 

This misconception can lead to confusion and incorrect calculations in various mathematical operations, particularly in algebra and when working with fractions, proportions, and ratios.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- Case 1: When simplifying fractions or rational expressions, students may incorrectly apply the reciprocal button to write the fraction instead of simplifying it correctly.
- Case 2: In algebra, when solving equations involving fractions or rational expressions, students may use the reciprocal button to ""write"" the fraction rather than correctly applying the operation to solve for the variable.
- Case 3: When working with proportions or ratios, students may misuse the reciprocal button to represent the proportion or ratio as a fraction, rather than understanding its true meaning and application."
2448,Cannot evaluate if an estimate is an underestimate or overestimate,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to determine whether their estimate is higher (overestimate) or lower (underestimate) than the actual value. They may understand the concept of estimation but lack the ability to analyze and compare their estimate with the actual value, leading to difficulties in identifying whether their estimate was too high or too low.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When estimating the number of objects in a container: A student may estimate that there are 50 marbles in a jar, but when the actual count is 75, they may not be able to recognize that their estimate was an underestimate.
- When estimating measurements: A student may estimate the length of a room to be 10 meters, but when the actual measurement is 12 meters, they may not be able to identify that their estimate was an underestimate.
- When estimating quantities in real-life scenarios: A student may estimate that it will take 2 hours to complete a task, but when it actually takes 3 hours, they may not be able to recognize that their estimate was an underestimate.
- When working with word problems: A student may be given a problem where they need to estimate the number of people attending an event, and they may estimate 200 people, but when the actual number is 250, they may not be able to identify that their estimate was an underestimate."
2449,Done a different calculation to the one given,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand or misinterpret the mathematical operation or calculation required to solve a problem. They may perform a different calculation or operation than the one specified in the question, often due to a lack of attention to detail, misunderstanding of the problem, or a lack of understanding of the mathematical concept being tested.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Performing addition instead of subtraction, or vice versa
* Multiplying instead of dividing, or vice versa
* Using the wrong formula or equation
* Calculating the wrong quantity or attribute

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Case 1: A year 5 student is asked to calculate the difference between 25 and 17, but instead, they add the two numbers together, resulting in an incorrect answer of 42.
* Case 2: A year 9 student is asked to find the area of a rectangle with a length of 6 cm and a width of 4 cm, but they use the formula for the perimeter instead of the area, resulting in an incorrect answer of 20 cm.
* Case 3: A year 12 student is asked to solve the equation 2x + 5 = 11, but they subtract 5 from both sides instead of subtracting 2x from both sides, resulting in an incorrect solution."
2450,Does not half sum of parallel sides when finding area of a trapezium,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the area of a trapezium. They understand that the formula for the area of a trapezium involves the sum of the parallel sides, but they fail to divide this sum by 2, resulting in an incorrect calculation. This error may stem from a misunderstanding of the formula or a simple arithmetic mistake.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. When finding the area of a trapezium with parallel sides of lengths 5cm and 7cm, and a height of 3cm, a student might calculate the area as (5 + 7) x 3 = 36 square cm, instead of (5 + 7)/2 x 3 = 18 square cm.
2. If a trapezium has parallel sides of lengths 10cm and 8cm, and a height of 4cm, a student might calculate the area as (10 + 8) x 4 = 72 square cm, instead of (10 + 8)/2 x 4 = 36 square cm.
3. In a problem where a trapezium has parallel sides of lengths 6cm and 4cm, and a height of 2cm, a student might calculate the area as (6 + 4) x 2 = 20 square cm, instead of (6 + 4)/2 x 2 = 10 square cm."
2451,When multiplying a vector by an integer does not multiply all parts of the vector,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to understand the scalar multiplication of vectors. They may believe that multiplying a vector by an integer only affects one component or part of the vector, rather than understanding that scalar multiplication affects the magnitude of the entire vector. This misconception can lead students to incorrectly calculate the result of multiplying a vector by an integer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When a student is asked to find the result of multiplying a 2D vector (e.g., (3, 4)) by an integer (e.g., 2), and they only multiply one component, resulting in an incorrect answer (e.g., (3, 8) or (6, 4) instead of (6, 8)).
- When a student is asked to find the result of multiplying a 3D vector (e.g., (2, 3, 4)) by an integer (e.g., -1), and they only change the sign of one component, resulting in an incorrect answer (e.g., (-2, 3, 4) or (2, -3, 4) instead of (-2, -3, -4)).
- When a student is asked to graph the result of multiplying a vector by an integer and they incorrectly plot the resulting vector, failing to account for the change in magnitude."
2452,Believes a parallelogram has one pair of equal sides,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a partial understanding of the properties of a parallelogram. They may recall that a parallelogram has some equal sides, but misunderstand the extent of this property. They believe a parallelogram has only one pair of equal sides, similar to an isosceles trapezoid, rather than understanding that a parallelogram actually has two pairs of equal opposite sides. This may stem from a lack of exposure to various types of parallelograms or insufficient practice in identifying and working with their properties.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When identifying shapes: A student may incorrectly identify a shape as a parallelogram based on the presence of only one pair of equal sides.
- When solving problems involving perimeter: A student may calculate the perimeter of a parallelogram incorrectly by assuming only one pair of equal sides.
- When creating or drawing parallelograms: A student may draw a shape that they believe is a parallelogram, but it only has one pair of equal sides, rather than two pairs of equal opposite sides.
- When comparing shapes: A student may incorrectly state that a shape is a parallelogram because it shares some properties with a parallelogram, such as one pair of equal sides, without considering the full definition of a parallelogram."
2453,Believes particular is the term used to describe two lines at right angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly use the term ""particular"" to describe two lines that intersect at a 90-degree angle, instead of the correct term ""perpendicular"". They may have a basic understanding of the concept of lines intersecting at right angles, but are using incorrect terminology to describe it.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When describing the relationship between two lines in a geometric shape, such as a square or rectangle.
- When identifying the properties of shapes in real-world objects, such as the intersection of two walls or the corners of a book.
- When solving problems involving the calculation of angles or shapes in geometry.
- When labeling or describing diagrams or drawings that involve intersecting lines.
- When explaining the properties of 2D or 3D shapes in a mathematical context."
2454,Confuses corresponding and alternate angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between corresponding angles and alternate angles in geometry, particularly when dealing with parallel lines and transversals. They may believe that corresponding angles and alternate angles are the same or have the same properties, leading to incorrect assumptions and conclusions when solving problems.

Corresponding angles are angles that are in the same relative position in two or more diagrams, but alternate angles are angles that are on opposite sides of a transversal and inside two lines. Students who hold this misconception may incorrectly identify or use these angles in problems involving parallel lines, angles in polygons, or angle properties in general.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When identifying angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal, students may incorrectly label or use corresponding angles instead of alternate angles, or vice versa.
- In problems involving angle sums in polygons, students may incorrectly apply the properties of corresponding or alternate angles, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When solving problems involving symmetries, reflections, or rotations, students may confuse corresponding and alternate angles, resulting in incorrect conclusions about the properties of the shapes or transformations.
- In real-world applications, such as architecture, engineering, or design, students may misapply the properties of corresponding and alternate angles, leading to errors in their designs or calculations."
2455,Tries to apply sohcahtoa to a non right angled triangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the application of the trigonometric ratios (SOHCAHTOA) learned in the context of right-angled triangles. They mistakenly believe that these ratios can be applied universally to any triangle, regardless of its angle properties. SOHCAHTOA is specifically designed for right-angled triangles, where the sine, cosine, and tangent ratios are defined as the ratios of the lengths of the opposite side, adjacent side, and hypotenuse. However, when dealing with non-right-angled triangles, these ratios do not hold, and alternative methods, such as the law of cosines or the law of sines, are required to solve the problem.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When finding the length of a side in an isosceles or scalene triangle.
- When determining the angles of a triangle in a real-world problem, such as navigation or building design.
- When solving problems involving trigonometry in art or design, where non-right-angled triangles are common.
- When dealing with 3D problems, where multiple non-right-angled triangles may be involved."
2456,Finds the mode rather than the range,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to find the range of a set of data, but instead, they identify the mode, which is the value that appears most frequently in the data set. This confusion may arise from a lack of understanding of the definitions of mode and range, or from a failure to recognize that the range is a measure of the spread of the data, while the mode is a measure of central tendency.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When students are given a set of exam scores and asked to find the range, but instead, they identify the score that most students achieved.
* When students are analyzing data on the favorite colors of their classmates and are asked to find the range of different colors, but instead, they identify the most popular color.
* When students are working with a set of temperatures recorded over a week and are asked to find the range of temperatures, but instead, they identify the temperature that occurred most frequently."
2457,"When asked for the mean of a list of data, gives the median","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to differentiate between the concepts of mean and median. They may understand that both measures are used to describe the central tendency of a dataset, but they often get confused about the specific calculation and application of each. As a result, when asked to find the mean, they mistakenly calculate or identify the median, which is the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in order. This confusion may be due to a lack of understanding of the definitions and formulas for mean and median, or it may be a result of overemphasizing the median in certain contexts, such as when dealing with skewed distributions.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with a small, odd-numbered dataset where the median is easily identifiable, but the mean requires calculation.
- When the dataset contains outliers that significantly affect the mean, making the median seem like a more representative measure.
- When students are asked to describe a dataset that is skewed or has an irregular distribution, and they mistakenly believe the median is always the best measure of central tendency.
- When students are given a multiple-choice question with the median as one of the answer choices, and they mistakenly select it as the mean."
2458,Multiplies by the denominator instead of dividing when finding a fraction of an amount,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find a fraction of a given quantity. Instead of understanding that the denominator represents the number of parts the whole is divided into, and the numerator represents the number of parts they need to find, students mistakenly multiply the quantity by the denominator. This results in an answer that is much larger than the actual amount.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding 1/4 of 12, students may multiply 12 by 4, resulting in 48, instead of dividing 12 by 4 to find the correct answer.
- When calculating 3/5 of 20, students may multiply 20 by 5, getting 100, instead of finding 3/5 of 20, which is actually 12.
- When asked to find 2/3 of 15, students may multiply 15 by 3, resulting in 45, rather than dividing 15 into thirds and finding 2 of those thirds."
2459,Believes alternate angles sum to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the property of supplementary angles (angles that add up to 180 degrees) to alternate angles. Alternate angles are actually equal in measure, not supplementary. This misconception may stem from a lack of understanding of the properties of angles formed by transversals and parallel lines. Students may incorrectly recall or apply the rules related to angles in geometry, leading them to believe that alternate angles sum to 180 degrees instead of being congruent.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When identifying the relationship between angles formed by a transversal cutting two parallel lines, students may incorrectly state that alternate angles add up to 180 degrees.
- In problems involving the calculation of missing angles in a diagram, students with this misconception may provide incorrect answers by trying to find an angle that, when added to the given alternate angle, equals 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving the properties of parallel lines and transversals, students may incorrectly apply the 180-degree rule to alternate angles, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- In geometric proofs or theorems involving alternate angles, students may mistakenly use the incorrect assumption that alternate angles sum to 180 degrees, leading to flawed reasoning and incorrect conclusions."
2460,Does not recognise an example of the angles in same segment theorem,"Explanation: The misconception here is that students may not understand that when two angles are formed by drawing two lines from a point outside a circle, and these lines intersect the circle at two different points, then the angles formed at the circumference are equal if they are in the same segment (i.e., they cut off the same arc). This means that the student fails to identify instances where the angles in the same segment theorem applies.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: When given a diagram with multiple angles and intersecting lines, the student may fail to identify which angles are equal due to being in the same segment.
- Case 2: In a problem requiring the student to find a missing angle, the student may not apply the angles in the same segment theorem to solve the problem.
- Case 3: When asked to provide examples of the angles in the same segment theorem, the student may provide incorrect or irrelevant examples, demonstrating their misunderstanding of the concept."
2461,"Believes that the larger the dividend, the smaller the answer.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there is an inverse relationship between the size of the dividend and the quotient (answer) in division. They may think that if the dividend is large, the quotient will be small, regardless of the divisor. This misunderstanding can be due to a lack of understanding of the division concept, where students focus solely on the size of the dividend rather than considering the relationship between the dividend, divisor, and quotient.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. 48 ÷ 6 vs. 480 ÷ 6: A student may think that because 480 is larger than 48, the quotient of 480 ÷ 6 will be smaller than 48 ÷ 6.
2. 100 ÷ 5 vs. 1000 ÷ 5: A student may believe that the quotient of 1000 ÷ 5 will be smaller than 100 ÷ 5 simply because 1000 is larger than 100.
3. 24 ÷ 3 vs. 240 ÷ 3: A student may incorrectly assume that the quotient of 240 ÷ 3 will be smaller than 24 ÷ 3 due to the larger size of the dividend (240)."
2462,Confuses the position of the median with its value,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of the median in a dataset. They may think that the position of the median (i.e., the middle value in an ordered dataset) is the same as its actual value. In other words, they may believe that the median is always the value at a specific position, rather than the actual value that lies at the middle of the dataset when it is arranged in order.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When finding the median of a dataset with an even number of values, students may think that the median is the value at the exact middle position, rather than the average of the two middle values.
* When dealing with a dataset that contains repeated values, students may assume that the median is the value that appears most frequently, rather than the middle value when the data is arranged in order.
* When comparing datasets, students may focus on the position of the median (e.g., ""the median is the 5th value"") rather than its actual value (e.g., ""the median is 10"")."
2463,"When multiplying an integer by a fraction, believes the numerator of the fraction will become the denominator","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of multiplying integers by fractions. They may think that when multiplying an integer by a fraction, the numerator and denominator of the fraction swap places. For example, they might believe that 2 × 3/4 is equal to 2 × 4/3, where the numerator 3 becomes the denominator, and the denominator 4 becomes the numerator. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the actual process of multiplying integers by fractions, which involves multiplying the integer by the numerator and then dividing by the denominator.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When multiplying a whole number by a fraction, such as 4 × 2/3, students might write the answer as 4 × 3/2.
- When solving real-world problems, like scaling a recipe, students might mistakenly swap the numerator and denominator, leading to incorrect results.
- In algebra, when solving equations involving fractions, students with this misconception might incorrectly manipulate the equations, leading to wrong solutions."
2464,"Believes the sides of a rectangle must be horizontal and vertical, not diagonal","Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a rigid understanding of the traditional representation of rectangles, often seen in everyday objects and diagrams, where the sides are typically drawn horizontally and vertically. They may struggle to recognize or accept a rectangle that is oriented at an angle or has diagonal sides, as it challenges their preconceived notion of what a rectangle should look like.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When drawing or identifying shapes, students may incorrectly label or exclude a rectangle that is not oriented in the traditional horizontal-vertical manner.
- When solving problems involving rectangles, students may assume that the sides are always horizontal and vertical, leading to incorrect calculations or measurements.
- In real-world applications, such as architecture or design, students may struggle to recognize or create rectangular shapes that are oriented at angles or have diagonal sides.
- When working with coordinate geometry, students may have difficulty plotting or identifying rectangular shapes that are not aligned with the x and y axes."
2465,Believes reflection in y = -x changes sign of x coordinate only,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning about reflections in the line y = -x. They mistakenly believe that reflecting a point across the line y = -x will only change the sign of the x-coordinate, but not the y-coordinate. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of how reflections work in different lines, particularly the line y = -x, which involves swapping the x and y coordinates and changing their signs.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to reflect a point (x, y) across the line y = -x, they might incorrectly respond with (-x, y) instead of (-y, -x).
- In graphing transformations of functions, students may incorrectly apply the reflection in y = -x, resulting in an incorrect graph.
- When solving problems involving reflections in coordinate geometry, students may only change the sign of the x-coordinate, leading to incorrect answers.
- In more complex problems, such as reflecting shapes or graphs across the line y = -x, students may apply this misconception, resulting in incorrect reflections."
2466,Uses tan when sin is required,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are dealing with trigonometric ratios in right-angled triangles, particularly in problems involving the relationships between the lengths of the sides and the angles. They mistakenly use the tangent (tan) ratio instead of the sine (sin) ratio. 

The tangent ratio is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the side adjacent to the angle, whereas the sine ratio is defined as the ratio of the length of the side opposite the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. 

This misconception often arises when students are unsure about which ratio to use in a particular problem, or when they fail to identify the hypotenuse and the side opposite the angle correctly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Finding the height of a building when the angle of elevation and the distance from the point of observation to the base of the building are known.
2. Calculating the length of a shadow when the angle of elevation of the sun and the height of the object are given.
3. Determining the distance from a point to the foot of a perpendicular line in a right-angled triangle.
4. Solving problems involving right-angled triangles in physics, such as projectile motion and forces.
5. Interpreting and solving problems involving the graphs of sine and tangent functions."
2467,Does not know the meaning of the word equidistant ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the term ""equidistant"" and its meaning in the context of geometry. The word ""equidistant"" refers to the property of being at an equal distance from two or more points, lines, or objects. Students who hold this misconception may struggle to understand concepts such as the midpoint of a line segment, the perpendicular bisector of a line segment, or the locus of points equidistant from two given points.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to find the midpoint of a line segment, a student with this misconception may be unable to understand why the midpoint is equidistant from the endpoints.
2. When drawing the perpendicular bisector of a line segment, a student with this misconception may not realize that every point on the perpendicular bisector is equidistant from the endpoints of the original line segment.
3. In a problem involving the locus of points equidistant from two given points, a student with this misconception may not be able to describe the set of points that satisfy the given condition."
2468,Does not know that three quarters of a turn is 270 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to convert fractions of a turn into degrees. They may understand that a full turn is 360 degrees, but struggle to calculate the degrees for a fraction of a turn, such as three quarters. This is often due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between fractions and angles, or difficulty in visualizing and dividing the circle into equal parts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to draw or identify an angle of three quarters of a turn on a diagram.
- When solving problems involving rotations or symmetry, where angles need to be calculated or identified.
- When working with geometric shapes, such as circles or sectors, where angles and fractions of a turn are involved.
- When asked to convert between fractions of a turn and degrees in a word problem or mathematical exercise.
- When visualizing and describing the movement of objects, such as a wheel or a merry-go-round, that rotate through three quarters of a turn."
2469,Believes a negative number can be replaced with its positive equivalent when answering an addition problem from a numberline,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly think that the absolute value or magnitude of a number is the only important aspect, ignoring the direction or sign of the number. When dealing with addition problems on a number line, they might assume that a negative number can be replaced with its positive equivalent, not understanding that this changes the direction of movement on the number line.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When adding a negative number to a positive number, such as 5 + (-3), the student might incorrectly replace -3 with 3 and move 3 units to the right of 5, instead of moving 3 units to the left.
- When adding two negative numbers, such as -2 + (-4), the student might replace both negative numbers with their positive equivalents and move 6 units to the right, instead of moving 6 units to the left.
- When dealing with word problems that involve temperature changes, such as ""If it was 5°C and the temperature dropped by 3°C"", the student might incorrectly add 3 to 5, instead of subtracting 3 from 5."
2470,Believes the mode is the most common frequency rather than the highest frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of mode in statistics. They believe that the mode is the frequency that appears most commonly in a set of data, rather than the actual value that has the highest frequency. In other words, they confuse the mode with the frequency of the mode. This leads them to incorrectly identify the mode as the frequency count itself, rather than the value that corresponds to that frequency.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: In a survey of favorite colors, the data shows that 5 students like blue, 3 students like red, and 8 students like green. A student with this misconception might say that the mode is 8, because it is the most common frequency, rather than saying that the mode is green, which is the color that has the highest frequency.
- Case 2: A student is given a set of exam scores: 60, 70, 70, 80, 80, 80. They might incorrectly say that the mode is 3, because the frequency of the score 80 is 3, rather than saying that the mode is 80, which is the score that appears most frequently.
- Case 3: In a dataset of shoe sizes, the frequencies are: size 6 (2), size 7 (4), size 8 (6). A student with this misconception might say that the mode is 6, because it is the highest frequency count, rather than saying that the mode is size 8, which is the shoe size that has the highest frequency."
2471,Believes the range is largest add smallest,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that to find the range of a set of data, they need to add the largest and smallest values together, rather than subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. This error may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of range, which is a measure of the spread or dispersion of data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the range of a set of exam scores, a student may add the highest score (e.g., 90) and the lowest score (e.g., 20) together, resulting in an incorrect range of 110.
- When analyzing data on the heights of students in a class, a student may add the height of the tallest student (e.g., 180 cm) and the shortest student (e.g., 120 cm) together, resulting in an incorrect range of 300 cm.
- When working with a dataset of temperatures, a student may add the highest temperature (e.g., 30°C) and the lowest temperature (e.g., -5°C) together, resulting in an incorrect range of 25°C."
2472,Does not know how to find the next term in a sequence,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to identify the underlying pattern or rule governing a sequence of numbers. They may fail to recognize the relationship between consecutive terms, leading to difficulty in predicting the next term. This can be due to a lack of understanding of basic number patterns, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, or more complex patterns like alternating or recursive sequences.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur:

1. **Simple addition sequence**: 2, 5, 8, 11, ? (Student fails to recognize the pattern of adding 3 to each term to find the next term)
2. **Multiplication sequence**: 2, 4, 8, 16, ? (Student fails to recognize the pattern of multiplying each term by 2 to find the next term)
3. **Alternating sequence**: 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, ? (Student fails to recognize the alternating pattern of adding 2, then subtracting 1)
4. **Recursive sequence**: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, ? (Student fails to recognize the pattern of adding consecutive integers to find the next term)
5. **Pattern blocks**: Red, blue, green, red, blue, ? (Student fails to recognize the repeating pattern of colors)

These cases highlight the various types of sequences where students may struggle to find the next term due to a lack of understanding of the underlying pattern or rule."
2473,Has cubed the base number and the power,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly apply the power rule of exponents to expressions involving addition or other operations, rather than just multiplication. Specifically, when dealing with an expression in the form of (a + b)^n, students with this misconception may incorrectly expand it by cubing both the base number 'a' and the power 'b', rather than following the correct rules for expanding expressions with exponents.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When expanding expressions such as (2 + 3)^3, the student may incorrectly calculate 2^3 + 3^3.
- When solving equations like (x + 2)^3, the student may mistakenly expand it as x^3 + 2^3.
- When working with algebraic expressions like (a + b)^3, the student may incorrectly apply the exponent to both 'a' and 'b' separately."
2474,Confuses the square root of the radius with the radius squared in the equation of a circle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with the equation of a circle, which is often given by the formula A = πr^2, where A is the area and r is the radius. However, when dealing with the equation in the context of the circle's area and its relation to the diameter or circumference, some students may mistakenly substitute the square root of the radius (√r) for the radius squared (r^2) or vice versa.

This confusion may stem from a lack of understanding of the mathematical operations involved, particularly the concept of squaring and finding square roots. It can also be caused by carelessness when writing or reading the equation, or simply by not fully grasping the relationship between the radius, diameter, and area of a circle.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When finding the area of a circle given its radius, a student may incorrectly write A = π√r instead of A = πr^2.
2. When solving for the radius of a circle given its area, a student may mistakenly rearrange the equation to r = √(A/π) and then incorrectly simplify it to r = A/π instead of r = √(A/π).
3. When comparing the areas of different circles, a student may incorrectly assume that the circle with the larger radius has an area that is directly proportional to the square root of the radius, rather than the radius squared."
2475,"When finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence, believes they only need to use the first term to calculate the coefficient of n ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence, which typically has the form: an^2 + bn + c. They may mistakenly believe that by only using the first term of the sequence, they can determine the value of 'a' (the coefficient of n^2) and then ignore the rest of the terms. They might assume that the relationship between the terms is only dependent on the first term, overlooking the importance of other terms in establishing the pattern and determining the coefficients 'b' and 'c'. This limited perspective can lead to incorrect derivation of the nth term rule.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Given the quadratic sequence: 2, 9, 20, 35, ..., a student may use only the first term (2) to calculate 'a', without considering the other terms.
2. When finding the nth term rule for the sequence: 5, 14, 27, 44, ..., a student might focus solely on the first term (5) to determine 'a', neglecting the importance of subsequent terms.
3. A student is given the sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, ..., and attempts to find the nth term rule by only analyzing the first term (1), ignoring the pattern established by the rest of the terms."
2476,Does not write the place holder zero when doing column multiplication,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students perform column multiplication and fail to include a placeholder zero in the partial products, especially when multiplying multi-digit numbers. They might not understand the importance of lining up the digits correctly or the role of the placeholder zero in maintaining the correct place value.

This misconception can lead to incorrect alignment of numbers, incorrect calculations, and ultimately, an incorrect product. It often arises from a lack of understanding of the concept of place value and how it applies to multiplication.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying 43 by 27, the student might write the partial product of 40 x 27 as 1080, but forget to include the placeholder zero when writing the partial product of 3 x 27, resulting in incorrect alignment.
- Multiplying 94 by 35, the student might not include the placeholder zero in the partial product of 90 x 35, leading to incorrect calculations.
- Multiplying 75 by 46, the student might forget to include the placeholder zero in the partial product of 70 x 46, causing errors in the final product."
2477,Thinks there are 30 seconds in a minute,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have difficulty understanding the concept of time units and conversion between them. They may be familiar with the idea that there are 30 days in a month, 30 degrees in a common angle measurement, or other instances where the number 30 holds significance. However, they may incorrectly apply this familiarity to the measurement of time, mistakenly believing that there are 30 seconds in a minute, rather than the correct 60 seconds.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to convert time from minutes to seconds or vice versa.
- When students are solving problems that involve time intervals, such as calculating elapsed time or scheduling events.
- When students are reading and interpreting analog clocks or digital time displays.
- When students are comparing time measurements in different units, such as minutes, seconds, and hours."
2478,Thinks the plan view is from the side of the shape,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to visualize and understand the different views of a 3D shape, specifically the plan view. They mistakenly believe that the plan view is obtained by looking at the shape from the side, rather than from directly above. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of plan views and elevations in geometry, or difficulty in interpreting 2D representations of 3D shapes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to draw the plan view of a 3D shape, such as a cube or a rectangular prism, and they draw it as if they are looking at it from the side.
* When students are given a 2D representation of a 3D shape and are asked to identify the plan view, but they incorrectly identify it as the side view.
* When students are working with real-world applications of geometry, such as architecture or engineering, and they need to visualize and draw the plan view of a building or structure, but they mistakenly draw it from the side."
2479,"When factorising into double brackets, believes the product of the constants in the brackets is of the opposite sign to the constant in the expanded equation.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning to factorise quadratic expressions into double brackets. They mistakenly believe that the product of the constants in the two brackets should have the opposite sign to the constant term in the expanded equation. For example, when factorising x^2 + 5x + 6, students might think that the product of the constants in the brackets should be -6 (opposite sign to +6), rather than correctly identifying the factors as (x + 2)(x + 3), where the product of the constants is +6.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Factorising quadratic expressions with two positive roots, such as x^2 + 7x + 12, where students might think the product of the constants should be -12.
- Factorising quadratic expressions with two negative roots, such as x^2 - 5x + 6, where students might think the product of the constants should be -6.
- Factorising quadratic expressions with a negative leading coefficient, such as -x^2 + 3x - 2, where students might get confused with the signs of the constants in the brackets."
2480,Thinks powers with different bases cannot be equal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that if two powers have different bases, they cannot be equal, regardless of their exponents. For example, students might think that 2^3 and 8^1 cannot be equal because they have different bases (2 and 8). They might struggle to recognize that 8 can be expressed as a power of 2 (2^3), and therefore, the two expressions can indeed be equal. This misconception can lead to difficulties in simplifying expressions, solving equations, and understanding the properties of exponents.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Comparing 2^4 and 16^1: Students might think that these two expressions cannot be equal because they have different bases.
* Simplifying expressions like (2^2)^3 and 4^3: Students might not recognize that 4 can be expressed as 2^2, and therefore, the two expressions are equal.
* Solving equations like 2^x = 8: Students might struggle to recognize that 8 can be expressed as 2^3, and therefore, x = 3 is a valid solution."
2481,"When multiplying decimals, divides by the wrong power of 10 when reinserting the decimal","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are multiplying decimals and need to reinsert the decimal point in their product. They may incorrectly determine the number of decimal places in the product by adding or subtracting the wrong number of decimal places from the original numbers. This often happens when they miscount the total number of decimal places in the factors or incorrectly apply the rule for placing the decimal point in the product.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Multiplying 4.5 and 0.6, a student might incorrectly reinsert the decimal point, thinking the product is 270.0 instead of 2.7.
- Multiplying 0.4 and 0.9, a student might incorrectly place the decimal point, thinking the product is 3.6 instead of 0.36.
- Multiplying 3.2 and 1.8, a student might miscount the decimal places and think the product is 576.0 instead of 5.76."
2482,Has written something to the power of 1 as 0.1,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of exponents, specifically when a number is raised to the power of 1. They may incorrectly assume that the exponent '1' represents a decimal or a fraction, rather than understanding that any number raised to the power of 1 is equal to the number itself. This misconception may be due to a lack of understanding of the concept of exponents or a misunderstanding of the notation.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

- When simplifying expressions, such as 2^1, students may write 0.2 instead of 2.
- When solving equations, such as 3^1 = x, students may answer x = 0.3 instead of x = 3.
- When evaluating expressions with multiple exponents, such as 2^1 * 3^2, students may incorrectly simplify the expression as 0.2 * 9 instead of 2 * 9."
2483,Believes that a negative sign in the base of a power means you need to find the reciprocal ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the meaning of a negative sign in the base of a power, such as in the expression (-2)^3. They believe that the negative sign indicates that they should take the reciprocal of the base, rather than understanding that it simply indicates that the base is a negative number.

For example, when faced with the expression (-2)^3, students with this misconception may think that they need to find the reciprocal of 2, which is 1/2, and then raise it to the power of 3, resulting in (1/2)^3. This is incorrect, as the correct interpretation is that the base is -2, and the expression should be evaluated as (-2) × (-2) × (-2).

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* Evaluating expressions with negative bases, like (-3)^2 or (-4)^5
* Simplifying algebraic expressions, such as (-x)^2 or (-2x)^3
* Solving equations involving powers with negative bases, like (-2)^x = 16
* Working with scientific notation, where a negative sign in the base can be misinterpreted as a sign to take the reciprocal."
2484,"When converting from an improper fraction to a mixed number, just writes the tens digit as the number of wholes","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting an improper fraction (a fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator) to a mixed number (a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction). The misconception occurs when students incorrectly assume that the tens digit of the numerator should be the number of wholes in the mixed number, rather than actually performing the division to find the number of wholes.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- When converting 17/4 to a mixed number, a student with this misconception might write 1 7/4, assuming the '1' from the tens place of the numerator is the number of wholes, instead of dividing 17 by 4.
- When converting 23/3 to a mixed number, a student might write 2 3/3, using the '2' from the tens place of the numerator as the number of wholes, instead of performing the division.
- When converting 48/5 to a mixed number, a student might write 4 8/5, assuming the '4' from the tens place of the numerator is the number of wholes, rather than dividing 48 by 5."
2485,"Thinks that times just before midnight are ""am"" times","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are learning about the 12-hour clock and the distinction between AM (Ante Meridiem) and PM (Post Meridiem) times. They may incorrectly believe that times just before midnight, such as 11:45 or 11:59, are ""am"" times, possibly due to the fact that they are close to the next day or that ""am"" is often associated with morning hours. However, times before midnight are actually still considered ""pm"" times, as the PM period starts at 12:00 pm (noon) and ends at 11:59 pm.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
- When students are asked to write times just before midnight in 12-hour format (e.g., 11:45 pm, 11:59 pm).
- When students are solving problems involving scheduling or timing around midnight (e.g., a movie ending at 11:45 pm, a countdown to midnight).
- When students are reading or interpreting clocks or schedules that involve times just before midnight (e.g., a bus schedule showing a departure at 11:55 pm)."
2486,Identifies the wrong two angles as base angles of an isosceles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify the wrong two angles as the base angles of an isosceles triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are the two angles that are equal in measure and are opposite the equal sides. However, students with this misconception may incorrectly identify the base angles as the two angles that are adjacent to the base or the two angles that are not equal.

This misconception may arise from a lack of understanding of the properties of isosceles triangles or a misunderstanding of the definition of base angles. Students may also be misled by the physical appearance of the triangle, such as the orientation or the size of the angles.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a triangle with two equal sides, a student identifies the vertex angle (the angle formed by the two equal sides) and one of the base angles as the two base angles.
- Case 2: In a triangle with two equal sides, a student identifies the two angles adjacent to the base as the base angles, instead of the two angles opposite the equal sides.
- Case 3: In a triangle with two equal sides, a student identifies the two angles that are not equal as the base angles, instead of the two angles that are equal in measure."
2487,Changes the given operation when substituting,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly alter the mathematical operation when substituting a value or expression into an equation or expression. For instance, if they are given an algebraic expression like 2x + 3 and are asked to substitute x with a value, they might change the operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) instead of just replacing the variable with the value.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When solving linear equations, students may change the operation when substituting a value for the variable, e.g., 2x + 3 = 5, substituting x = 2 as 2(2) - 3 instead of 2(2) + 3.
- In algebraic expressions, students might change the operation when substituting values, e.g., 3x - 2, substituting x = 1 as 3(1) + 2 instead of 3(1) - 2.
- When working with formulas, students may incorrectly change the operation when substituting values, e.g., the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = length × width), substituting length = 5 and width = 3 as A = 5 + 3 instead of A = 5 × 3."
2488,Answers order of operations questions with brackets as if the brackets are not there,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to recognize the importance of brackets (or parentheses) in mathematical expressions, specifically in questions that involve the order of operations. The order of operations is a set of rules that dictates the order in which mathematical operations should be performed when there are multiple operations in an expression. Brackets are used to group numbers and operations together, indicating that they should be evaluated first.

When students ignore brackets or fail to recognize their significance, they may perform operations in the wrong order, leading to incorrect answers. For example, in the expression 3 × 2 + 10 - (5 - 2), a student with this misconception may perform the multiplication first, followed by the addition and subtraction, without evaluating the expression inside the brackets first.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Evaluating expressions like 2 × (3 + 4) as 2 × 3 + 4 instead of 2 × 7
* Simplifying expressions like 10 - (2 + 3) as 10 - 2 + 3 instead of 10 - 5
* Solving equations like 2 × (x + 3) = 10 as 2x + 3 = 10 instead of 2x + 6 = 10
* Working with expressions like (5 - 2) × 3 as 5 - 2 × 3 instead of 3 × 3"
2489,Thinks cube numbers are triangular numbers,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that cube numbers (numbers obtained by cubing integers, e.g., 1³ = 1, 2³ = 8, 3³ = 27) are the same as triangular numbers (numbers obtained by summing consecutive integers, e.g., 1, 1+2 = 3, 1+2+3 = 6). They may incorrectly assume that the two sequences are identical or overlap significantly.

This misconception can occur in various situations:

1. When encountering the number 1: Since 1 is both a cube number (1³) and a triangular number (the sum of the first integer), students might assume that this pattern continues.
2. When dealing with small numbers: For small numbers, the difference between cube numbers and triangular numbers might not be immediately apparent, leading students to confuse the two sequences.
3. When visualizing geometric representations: Students might mistakenly associate the geometric representation of cube numbers (e.g., a cube with a side length of 3) with the geometric representation of triangular numbers (e.g., a triangle with 3 rows of dots).
4. When working with patterns and sequences: If students are asked to identify or generate patterns, they might mistakenly apply the formula or sequence for triangular numbers to cube numbers or vice versa."
2490,Assumes Pythagoras' theorem doesn't work if they can spot a pattern between the side lengths,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that Pythagoras' theorem only applies to certain sets of numbers or when there's no apparent pattern between the side lengths of a right-angled triangle. They may think that if the side lengths have a simple ratio or pattern, such as 3:4:5, then Pythagoras' theorem is not needed or does not work.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dealing with Pythagorean triples, such as 3:4:5 or 5:12:13, where students may assume that the pattern is more important than the theorem itself.
- When working with right-angled triangles with simple side lengths, such as a triangle with sides of length 6, 8, and 10, where students may rely on spotting the pattern rather than applying the theorem.
- When solving problems that involve finding the length of the hypotenuse or a side of a right-angled triangle, and students mistakenly believe that they can only use the theorem if the side lengths are 'random' or do not have a clear pattern."
2491,"Thinks that in the equation x=a, a is the gradient","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to linear equations in the form of y = mx + c, where m represents the gradient. They might mistakenly apply this understanding to other types of equations, such as x = a, where 'a' is a constant value. Here, students incorrectly assume that 'a' serves the same purpose as 'm' in the linear equation, which is the gradient or the rate of change. However, 'a' in the equation x = a simply represents a fixed value that 'x' is equal to, and it does not imply any rate of change or slope.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are given an equation x = 3 and asked to identify the gradient, they might incorrectly answer that the gradient is 3.
- When comparing the equations x = 2 and y = 2x, students might think that both '2's represent the same concept, which is the gradient.
- When graphing the equation x = 4 on a coordinate plane, students might mistakenly draw a line with a slope of 4 instead of a vertical line at x = 4."
2492,Confuses rest and movement on a distance time graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to interpret distance-time graphs, particularly in distinguishing between periods of rest and movement. They may incorrectly identify a horizontal line on the graph, which represents a period of rest (no change in distance over time), as movement, or vice versa. This confusion can also lead to misinterpretation of the graph's slope, which represents speed.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

1. A student is analyzing a distance-time graph of a person's journey and incorrectly identifies a horizontal section as the person moving at a constant speed, rather than being at rest.
2. When asked to describe the motion of an object based on its distance-time graph, a student mistakenly states that the object is moving when the graph shows a horizontal line, indicating no change in distance.
3. A student is given a distance-time graph with multiple sections, including horizontal and sloping lines, and incorrectly identifies the periods of rest and movement, leading to an incorrect description of the object's motion."
2493,Does not know the properties of a rhombus,"Explanation: A common misconception students may have is that they do not fully understand the properties of a rhombus. They may believe that a rhombus is just a type of quadrilateral, but they do not recognize its unique characteristics, such as all sides being of equal length, opposite angles being equal, and diagonals bisecting each other at right angles. This lack of understanding can lead to difficulties in identifying and working with rhombi in various geometric contexts.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify the type of quadrilateral that has all sides of equal length, students may not recognize it as a rhombus.
2. When given a diagram of a rhombus, students may not be able to identify its properties, such as equal opposite angles or bisecting diagonals.
3. When asked to find the perimeter of a rhombus, students may not realize that all sides are equal, leading to incorrect calculations.
4. When working with shapes in real-world applications, such as design or architecture, students may not recognize the properties of a rhombus, leading to incorrect designs or measurements."
2494,Does not know the meaning of consecutive,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unclear about the definition of consecutive and how it applies to numbers, events, or items. Consecutive refers to something that follows one after the other in a continuous sequence, without gaps or interruptions. However, students with this misconception may not fully grasp this concept, leading to misunderstandings in various mathematical contexts.

Some short cases when this misconception may occur:

- When asked to identify consecutive numbers in a sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 6), students may include non-consecutive numbers or fail to recognize the correct sequence.
- In algebra, students may struggle to understand that consecutive terms in a sequence or pattern must follow a specific order, such as in the sequence x, x+1, x+2.
- When dealing with data and statistics, students may incorrectly identify consecutive days, months, or years when analyzing data or creating graphs.
- In geometry, students may not recognize that consecutive angles or sides in a shape are adjacent to each other, leading to incorrect calculations or conclusions.
- When working with measurement, students may misunderstand that consecutive units of measurement (e.g., centimeters, meters) must be used in a continuous and sequential manner."
2495,Compares sizes of angles on a grid by estimating rather than using the gradient of the lines,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to compare the sizes of angles on a grid, but instead of using the gradient or slope of the lines to determine the angle size, they rely on visual estimation. This can lead to inaccurate comparisons, as the appearance of angle size can be deceiving, especially when the angles are close in size or the lines are not aligned with the grid axes.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When comparing the steepness of two lines on a graph, students might think the line that ""looks"" steeper has a larger angle, without considering the actual gradient of the lines.
* When determining whether two angles on a grid are equal or not, students might rely on visual inspection rather than calculating the gradient of the lines to make an accurate comparison.
* When working with shapes on a grid, such as triangles or quadrilaterals, students might estimate the size of angles based on their appearance, rather than using the gradient of the lines to determine the actual angle size.
* When solving problems involving right-angled triangles on a grid, students might use estimation to determine the size of the angles, rather than applying trigonometric concepts or using the gradient of the lines to find the exact angle size."
2496,"Believes composite function notation fg(x) means to multiply the first terms of f and g together, and the second terms of f and g together","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of composite functions in algebra. They incorrectly assume that the notation fg(x) or (f ∘ g)(x) implies a multiplication operation between corresponding terms of the two functions, f and g. For example, if f(x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = 3x - 2, they might think that fg(x) is obtained by multiplying the first terms (2 and 3) and the second terms (1 and -2) separately, resulting in an incorrect expression.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- When students are asked to find the composite function of two simple linear functions, like f(x) = 2x + 1 and g(x) = 3x - 2.
- When dealing with more complex functions, such as f(x) = x^2 + 1 and g(x) = 2x - 3, where the incorrect multiplication approach would lead to an even more incorrect result.
- In problems involving function composition with different types of functions, such as a linear function composed with a quadratic function or a trigonometric function composed with a polynomial function."
2497,Believes f(x - a) translates the function down a units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the effect of the expression f(x - a) on the graph of a function. They incorrectly believe that the presence of 'a' within the function translates the graph vertically, i.e., down by 'a' units, instead of recognizing that it actually shifts the graph horizontally. This misconception is rooted in a lack of understanding of function transformations, specifically the difference between vertical and horizontal shifts.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Graphing functions like f(x - 2) where students might think the graph of f(x) will move down by 2 units instead of moving right by 2 units.
- Interpreting the transformation of a function like f(x - 5) + 3, where students might think the graph moves down by 5 units and up by 3 units, instead of moving right by 5 units and up by 3 units.
- Analyzing the transformation of trigonometric functions like sin(x - π/2), where students might incorrectly assume the graph shifts down by π/2 units instead of shifting right by π/2 units."
2498,Thinks I can be subtracted from L in Roman numerals,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to Roman numerals but have not fully grasped the rules governing their use, particularly with regards to subtraction. In Roman numerals, certain letters can be subtracted from others to represent different numbers, but this is subject to specific rules. For instance, I can be subtracted from V (5) and X (10), but the misconception here is that this rule applies universally, including subtracting I from L (50). This misunderstanding may stem from an incomplete understanding of the Roman numeral system's subtractive principle.

Cases where this misconception may occur:

1. When writing the number 49, the student may incorrectly write IL instead of XLIX.
2. When subtracting 1 from 50, the student might write IL instead of XLIX.
3. When representing the year 49 in Roman numerals, the student may write IL instead of XLIX."
2499,Thinks the interior angles of any polygon add up to 180 degrees,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students overgeneralize the rule that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. They may incorrectly assume that this applies to all polygons, regardless of the number of sides. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of the relationship between the number of sides in a polygon and the sum of its interior angles.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When asked to calculate the sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral, the student may incorrectly answer 180 degrees.
- When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles of polygons with more than three sides, such as hexagons or octagons.
- When comparing the sum of interior angles of different polygons, the student may incorrectly state that they are all equal to 180 degrees.
- When solving problems that involve finding missing angles in polygons, the student may use the incorrect assumption that the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees."
2500,Believes the gradient of a line is given by an intercept,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the gradient (or slope) of a line is given by the y-intercept, rather than the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change. This means they may think that the value of the y-intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis) is the same as the gradient, which is a measure of how steep the line is.

This misconception can occur in cases such as:

- When finding the equation of a line in slope-intercept form (y = mx + c), students might incorrectly identify the value of 'c' (the y-intercept) as the gradient.
- When graphing a line, students might plot the y-intercept and then draw a line with a slope that is not represented by the y-intercept value.
- When solving problems involving rates of change, such as calculating the steepness of a ramp or the rate of change of a quantity over time, students might use the y-intercept value instead of the gradient to describe the rate of change."
2501,Subtracts rather than multiplies when calculating total frequency,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are working with data and statistics, particularly when dealing with grouped data or frequency tables. They may mistakenly believe that to find the total frequency, they need to subtract the frequencies of individual groups rather than multiplying the frequency of each group by the number of groups. 

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When calculating the total number of items in a grouped frequency table, students may subtract the frequencies of each group instead of multiplying the frequency of each group by the number of groups.
- When finding the total number of people in a survey who responded in a certain way, students may subtract the number of people in each response category instead of multiplying the frequency of each response by the number of categories.
- When determining the total number of items sold in a store, students may subtract the number of items sold in each department instead of multiplying the frequency of sales in each department by the number of departments."
2502,Believes a reciprocal equation will have a quadratic graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that any equation involving a reciprocal term (i.e., a fraction with the variable in the denominator) will result in a quadratic graph. They may incorrectly generalize the characteristics of quadratic equations, which have a squared variable term (e.g., x^2), to reciprocal equations. As a result, they may expect the graph of a reciprocal equation to be a parabola, similar to the graph of a quadratic equation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When graphing simple reciprocal equations, such as y = 1/x, and expecting a parabolic shape.
- When solving problems involving reciprocal functions in real-world contexts, such as electrical resistance or harmonic motion, and incorrectly assuming the relationship between variables will be quadratic.
- When comparing the graphs of reciprocal and quadratic functions, and failing to recognize the distinct differences between them.
- When attempting to apply quadratic formula or techniques to solve reciprocal equations, leading to incorrect solutions or graphs."
2503,Believes that a greater percentage represents a greater quantity,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret percentages in absolute terms, without considering the context or the base value to which the percentage is being applied. They mistakenly believe that a greater percentage always represents a greater quantity or amount, regardless of the initial value. For example, students might think that a 20% increase on a small number is more than a 10% increase on a larger number, without realizing that the actual increase in value could be greater in the latter case.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Comparing discounts: A student might think that a 20% discount on a $10 item is better than a 10% discount on a $50 item, without realizing that the actual discount amount is $2 in the first case and $5 in the second case.
- Evaluating interest rates: A student might believe that a 10% interest rate on a $100 investment is better than a 5% interest rate on a $1000 investment, without considering the actual interest earned in each case.
- Analyzing data: A student might misinterpret data showing that a certain product has a 25% increase in sales, while another product has only a 10% increase, without looking at the actual sales figures and realizing that the second product may have sold more units overall."
2504,"Does not realise that two letters together, or a number and letter together, are multiplying","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to algebraic expressions and they fail to recognize that when two letters or a number and a letter appear together, it implies multiplication. They may interpret the combination of letters or a number and a letter as a new variable or a new number, rather than understanding that it represents the product of the two values.

For example, in the expression 2x or xy, students with this misconception may view '2x' as a single variable or 'xy' as a new variable, rather than recognizing that '2' is being multiplied by 'x', or 'x' is being multiplied by 'y'.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying algebraic expressions, such as 2x + 3x, students may not combine the terms because they do not recognize that '2x' means 2 times x.
- When expanding expressions like (2x)(3y), students may not apply the multiplication rule correctly because they do not understand that '2x' is a product of 2 and x.
- When solving equations, such as 2x = 6, students may not isolate the variable 'x' correctly because they do not recognize that '2x' represents 2 times x."
2505,Confuses cl and ml,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to differentiate between the units of measurement for volume, specifically centiliters (cl) and milliliters (ml). Students may think that these units are unrelated or not interchangeable, or they may incorrectly convert between them. This can be due to a lack of understanding of the metric system and the prefixes used, as well as insufficient practice in converting between units.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When reading labels on bottles or containers with different units (e.g., a 500ml water bottle vs. a 50cl juice bottle).
- When completing recipes or instructions that require conversions between cl and ml.
- When solving math problems involving volume measurements, such as calculating the total volume of liquids or comparing volumes.
- When comparing the volumes of different objects or substances measured in cl and ml.
- When working with real-world applications, such as measuring medicine or ingredients for cooking, that require accurate conversions between units."
2506,"Believes cumulative frequency is the sum of each class with the previous class, rather than all previous classes","Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of cumulative frequency. They may think that to find the cumulative frequency, they only need to add the frequency of the current class to the frequency of the previous class, rather than adding the frequency of the current class to the cumulative frequency of all previous classes. This means they will not be considering the frequencies of classes before the previous one, leading to an incorrect calculation.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When creating a cumulative frequency table from a grouped frequency table and only adding the frequency of the current class to the frequency of the previous class.
- When plotting a cumulative frequency graph and using the incorrect cumulative frequencies calculated by only adding the frequency of each class to the previous class.
- When finding the median or other percentiles from a cumulative frequency table or graph and using the incorrect cumulative frequencies.
- When comparing the cumulative frequencies of different data sets and using the incorrect method to calculate the cumulative frequencies."
2507,Mistakes unit of speed for unit of time,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the unit of speed (e.g., miles per hour, kilometers per hour) with the unit of time (e.g., hours, minutes, seconds). They may incorrectly assume that a speed of 60 kilometers per hour means it takes 60 hours to travel a certain distance, rather than understanding that it means the object is traveling at a rate of 60 kilometers every hour.

This misconception can arise in various situations, such as:

* When reading speed limit signs or traffic information, students might think that a 30 miles per hour speed limit means it takes 30 hours to travel a certain distance.
* When solving problems involving speed, distance, and time, students may incorrectly use the unit of speed as the unit of time, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When interpreting graphs or charts that display speed over time, students may mistakenly think that the speed axis represents time rather than the rate of change of distance.
* When discussing real-life scenarios, such as travel times or racing, students may incorrectly use the unit of speed to estimate the time it takes to complete a journey or a race.
* When comparing speeds, students may incorrectly think that a higher speed means a longer time, rather than understanding that it means a faster rate of travel."
2508,Thinks x = ? is the y axis,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the variable 'x' in an equation, such as x = ?, represents the vertical axis (y-axis) on a graph. They may incorrectly assume that the value of 'x' corresponds to the up-down movement on the graph, rather than the horizontal axis (x-axis) which it actually represents.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When graphing simple linear equations, such as x = 3, students may plot the point on the y-axis instead of the x-axis.
- When solving equations like x + 2 = 5, students may think the solution represents a point on the y-axis rather than the x-axis.
- When interpreting the x-intercept of a graph, students may mistakenly identify it as the point where the graph crosses the y-axis instead of the x-axis.
- When working with functions, such as f(x) = 2x, students may incorrectly assume that the input 'x' represents the output on the y-axis rather than the input on the x-axis."
2509,Mixes up the sets in a Venn diagram,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty understanding the relationships between different sets in a Venn diagram, leading to incorrect placement of elements within the diagram. They may struggle to identify which elements belong to the intersection, union, or individual sets, resulting in incorrect conclusions about the relationships between the sets.

This misconception can arise due to various reasons, such as:

* Lack of understanding of set notation and terminology (e.g., union, intersection, subset)
* Difficulty visualizing the relationships between sets
* Insufficient practice working with Venn diagrams
* Misinterpretation of the diagram's structure and layout

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to shade the region of a Venn diagram representing the intersection of two sets, a student shades the entire circle instead of just the overlapping region.
2. A student incorrectly identifies the elements that belong to the union of two sets, including elements that are only in one of the sets.
3. When working with a Venn diagram involving three sets, a student becomes confused about which elements belong to the intersection of two sets versus the intersection of all three sets.
4. A student incorrectly assumes that an element can only belong to one set, rather than recognizing that it can belong to multiple sets simultaneously.
5. When asked to create a Venn diagram to represent a given scenario, a student incorrectly places elements in the wrong regions or sets."
2510,Only reads the percentage symbol as applying to the units digit,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the percentage symbol (%) only applies to the units digit of a number, rather than the entire number. For example, they might think that 25% of a number means 25% of the last digit, rather than 25% of the entire number.

This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and misunderstandings when working with percentages in various mathematical contexts. 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. A shirt is on sale for 15% off its original price of £20. A student with this misconception might think the discount is only 15% of the last digit (£0.15 off), rather than 15% of the entire price (£3 off).
2. A student scores 85% on a test, but thinks this means they got 85% of the last question correct, rather than 85% of the entire test.
3. A recipe calls for a 25% increase in the amount of sugar. A student with this misconception might add 25% of the last digit (e.g., 0.25 cups), rather than 25% of the entire amount (e.g., 1.25 cups)."
2511,Does not know the properties of a linear graph,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to identify and apply the key characteristics of a linear graph, which is a fundamental concept in Algebra and Geometry. They may struggle to recognize that a linear graph is a straight line, and that it can be represented by the equation y = mx + c, where 'm' is the slope (or gradient) and 'c' is the y-intercept. They may also have difficulty understanding how changes in 'm' and 'c' affect the graph.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- Assuming that a linear graph can have curves or bends
- Failing to recognize that a linear equation can be represented graphically as a straight line
- Difficulty in identifying the x and y intercepts of a linear graph
- Struggling to determine the slope of a linear graph
- Inability to distinguish between a linear and non-linear graph

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is given the equation y = 2x + 3 and is asked to draw the graph. They draw a curved line instead of a straight line.
- Case 2: A student is shown a graph of a straight line and is asked to write the equation. They write a non-linear equation, such as y = x^2 + 2.
- Case 3: A student is asked to find the slope of a linear graph, but they calculate the x-intercept instead."
2512,"Believes when dividing numbers with the same base you divide the powers, rather than subtracting","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the rules of exponents and indices, specifically when dealing with division of numbers with the same base. They mistakenly believe that when dividing two numbers with the same base, they need to divide the powers (exponents) instead of subtracting them. This misunderstanding may stem from the fact that when multiplying numbers with the same base, the powers are added, leading students to assume a similar operation (division) would involve a similar process (dividing).

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions such as 6^8 ÷ 6^4, students might divide the powers (8 ÷ 4 = 2) instead of subtracting them (8 - 4 = 4), resulting in an incorrect answer of 6^2 instead of 6^4.
- When solving equations like 2^x ÷ 2^3 = 2^5, students may incorrectly divide the powers, leading to an incorrect solution for x.
- In problems involving geometric sequences or exponential growth/decay, students may apply this misconception, resulting in incorrect calculations and conclusions."
2513,"When finding the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence, believes that the coefficient of n squared is determined by first differences","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are trying to find the nth term rule for a quadratic sequence. They mistakenly believe that the coefficient of the n squared term can be found by looking at the pattern in the first differences between consecutive terms, rather than the second differences. This leads them to incorrectly identify the coefficient of the n squared term, resulting in an incorrect nth term rule.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When finding the nth term rule for a sequence like 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, and the student tries to identify the coefficient of the n squared term by looking at the first differences (3, 5, 7, 9).
- When given a sequence like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and the student incorrectly identifies the coefficient of the n squared term by analyzing the pattern in the first differences (3, 5, 7, 9) instead of the second differences.
- When working with a sequence like 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, and the student mistakenly uses the first differences (3, 5, 7, 9) to determine the coefficient of the n squared term in the nth term rule."
2514,Does not cube the conversion factor when converting cubed units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to convert between units of volume, such as cubic meters (m³) to cubic centimeters (cm³) or cubic inches to cubic feet. The mistake occurs when the student correctly identifies the conversion factor between the units of length (e.g., 1 meter = 100 centimeters), but fails to cube this conversion factor when converting the units of volume.

In other words, the student only multiplies or divides by the conversion factor once, instead of cubing it, which is necessary when converting units of volume. This results in an incorrect conversion and ultimately, an incorrect answer.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Converting the volume of a container from cubic meters to cubic centimeters, e.g., 5 m³ to cm³.
- Changing the volume of a room from cubic feet to cubic inches, e.g., 100 ft³ to in³.
- Converting the volume of a liquid from cubic liters to cubic milliliters, e.g., 5 L to mL.
- Changing the volume of a box from cubic yards to cubic feet, e.g., 2 yd³ to ft³."
2515,Rounds too early in calculation ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students round numbers too early in a calculation, often due to a lack of understanding of the importance of maintaining precision throughout the calculation process. Students may round numbers prematurely to simplify the calculation, but this can lead to inaccurate results, especially in multi-step problems. Rounding too early can also make it difficult to identify and correct errors later on in the calculation.

This misconception can occur in various mathematical operations, such as:

- Calculating perimeters and areas of shapes, where rounding the dimensions too early can lead to an incorrect final answer.
- Performing multi-step calculations, where rounding intermediate results can accumulate errors and affect the final result.
- Working with decimals and percentages, where rounding too early can lead to significant errors in calculations involving interest rates, taxes, or other financial applications.
- Converting between units, where rounding too early can result in inaccurate conversions and affect subsequent calculations.
- Solving algebraic equations, where rounding coefficients or constants too early can lead to incorrect solutions."
2516,Thinks 3-letter angle notation has to use the nearest vertex on each side of the angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of 3-letter angle notation in geometry. They may believe that when labeling an angle, they must choose the vertex closest to the angle on each side, rather than understanding that any three points that form the angle can be used. This misconception can lead to confusion when dealing with more complex geometric shapes or when the angle is formed by two lines that intersect at a point that is not a vertex of a shape.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When labeling angles in a triangle, a student might think that they must use the vertex closest to the angle, rather than realizing that any three points that form the angle can be used (e.g., angle ABC, angle ACB, or angle CAB).
- When working with angles formed by intersecting lines, a student might incorrectly assume that they must use the point of intersection and the closest vertex on each line, rather than choosing any three points that form the angle.
- In more complex shapes, such as quadrilaterals or polygons, students may become confused when trying to label angles, as there are more vertices and sides to consider."
2517,Does not rearrange the Pythagoras' Theorem formula accurately,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to correctly rearrange the Pythagoras' Theorem formula (a² + b² = c²) to solve for different variables. They may have difficulty isolating the variable they are trying to find, often leading to incorrect calculations or formula manipulations.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

- When solving for the length of one of the shorter sides (a or b), students might not correctly subtract the squared value of the other side from the squared value of the hypotenuse (c).
- When solving for the length of the hypotenuse (c), students might not correctly add the squared values of the other two sides or might forget to take the square root of the result.
- When given an equation in the form of a² + b² = c², students might not be able to rearrange it to solve for a specific variable, such as solving for 'a' when 'b' and 'c' are given.

Short cases when this misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of 3cm and 4cm.
- Case 2: In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is 10cm and one leg is 6cm. Find the length of the other leg.
- Case 3: Rearrange the Pythagoras' Theorem formula to solve for 'b' when 'a' is 5cm and 'c' is 13cm."
2518,May have made a calculation error using the order of operations,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students incorrectly apply the order of operations (often remembered by the acronym BIDMAS or PEMDAS) when evaluating mathematical expressions that involve multiple operations. BIDMAS stands for Brackets, Indices, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. Students might mistakenly perform operations in the wrong order, leading to incorrect results.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Evaluating expressions like 3 + 4 × 2, where students might add 3 and 4 first instead of multiplying 4 and 2.
2. Simplifying expressions like 12 ÷ 3 + 2, where students might divide 12 by the sum of 3 and 2 instead of dividing 12 by 3 and then adding 2.
3. Solving equations like 2 × (3 + 4) - 1, where students might multiply 2 by 3 and then add 4 instead of evaluating the expression inside the brackets first.
4. Working with expressions like 9 - 3 + 2, where students might subtract 3 from 9 and then add 2, but get the order wrong when there are multiple operations of the same type (e.g., multiple additions or subtractions).
5. Evaluating expressions with exponents, such as 2 + 3^2, where students might add 2 and 3 first and then square the result instead of squaring 3 and then adding 2."
2519,Confuses a term with a variable,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to distinguish between a term in an algebraic expression and a variable. A term is a single part of an expression that is separated by an operation, such as addition or subtraction, and can be a constant, a variable, or a combination of both. On the other hand, a variable is a symbol that represents a value that can change.

Students with this misconception may interpret a term as a single variable, rather than understanding that it can be a combination of variables and constants. For example, in the expression 3x + 2, students may think that 3x is a single variable, rather than a term that consists of a variable (x) multiplied by a constant (3).

This misconception can lead to errors when students are asked to perform algebraic operations, such as simplifying expressions or solving equations.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Simplifying expressions: When asked to simplify an expression like 2x + 3x, students may think that 2x and 3x are different variables, rather than understanding that they are like terms that can be combined.
- Solving equations: When solving an equation like 2x + 5 = 11, students may try to isolate the term 2x as if it were a single variable, rather than understanding that they need to isolate the variable x.
- Expanding expressions: When asked to expand an expression like (2x + 3)(x + 2), students may confuse the terms in the expression and fail to apply the distributive property correctly."
2520,Believes the fraction line represents addition,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly believe that the line separating the numerator and denominator in a fraction represents addition, rather than division. They may interpret the fraction 1/2 as 1 + 2, resulting in a completely different value. This misconception can stem from a lack of understanding of the concept of fractions as equal parts of a whole, or from an overreliance on the concept of addition in earlier math lessons.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* When students are asked to simplify fractions, they may add the numerator and denominator instead of dividing them.
* When comparing fractions, students may mistakenly add the numerators and denominators to determine which fraction is larger.
* When solving word problems involving fractions, students may misinterpret the fraction line as addition, leading to incorrect solutions.
* When converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, students may add the whole number and denominator instead of multiplying the whole number by the denominator and adding the numerator."
2521,Does not know how to measure reflex angles,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with the concept of reflex angles and how to measure them. A reflex angle is an angle greater than 180 degrees and less than 360 degrees. Students may struggle to understand that reflex angles are measured in the same way as other angles, but the angle is 'bent' the other way, or 'reflexed'. They may think that reflex angles are simply 'the outside' of an acute or obtuse angle, and therefore may not know how to measure them using a protractor or other measuring tools.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Measuring the angle between two intersecting lines that form an 'outside' angle greater than 180 degrees.
- Calculating the size of an angle in a shape that involves reflex angles, such as a polygon with more than 4 sides.
- Solving problems involving angles in real-life situations, such as measuring the angle of a turn or bend in a road or path.
- Drawing and measuring angles in geometry and construction problems.
- Understanding and applying the properties of reflex angles in more advanced math concepts, such as trigonometry and circle theorems."
2522,Believes the total of the circle in a Venn should be included when intersections should be omitted,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are working with Venn diagrams, particularly when dealing with overlapping sets. They tend to incorrectly believe that the total number of elements in a circle (or set) should be included when calculating the total number of elements in the union of two or more sets. However, they fail to account for the fact that the elements in the intersection of the sets are being counted multiple times, resulting in an overcount.

In a Venn diagram, the intersection of two sets represents the elements that are common to both sets. When calculating the total number of elements in the union of two sets, students should only count the elements in each set that are not in the intersection, and then add the elements in the intersection only once. However, students with this misconception will include the total number of elements in each circle, effectively counting the elements in the intersection multiple times.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When finding the total number of students who play either football or basketball, given that some students play both sports.
- When calculating the total number of books that are either fiction or non-fiction, given that some books can be classified as both.
- When determining the total number of people who speak either English or Spanish, given that some people speak both languages."
2523,Has added on the power of 1/4 rather than raise to the power of 1/4,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dealing with fractional exponents, particularly when they are required to raise a number to a fractional power, such as 1/4. Instead of understanding that raising a number to the power of 1/4 means finding the fourth root of the number, they mistakenly add 1/4 to the number or multiply the number by 1/4. This indicates a lack of understanding of the concept of fractional exponents and their relationship to roots.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* When simplifying expressions like 16^(1/4), students may answer 16 + 1/4 or 16 * 1/4 instead of finding the fourth root of 16.
* When solving equations like x^(1/4) = 2, students may try to isolate x by subtracting 1/4 from both sides or dividing both sides by 1/4, rather than raising both sides to the power of 4.
* When evaluating expressions like (2^4)^(1/4), students may mistakenly add or multiply 1/4 to the exponent 4, instead of understanding that (2^4)^(1/4) is equivalent to 2^(4*(1/4)) = 2^1 = 2."
2524,Has added the powers rather than multiplying them,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly add the exponents (powers) of numbers with the same base instead of multiplying them, often due to a misunderstanding of the rule for multiplying powers with the same base. For example, when multiplying two numbers with the same base, such as 2^3 and 2^4, students may incorrectly add the powers (3 + 4) and write the result as 2^7, instead of multiplying the numbers correctly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Multiplying numbers with the same base: 3^2 * 3^5 (adding powers: 2 + 5 = 7; incorrect result: 3^7)
- Simplifying algebraic expressions: (x^2) * (x^4) (adding powers: 2 + 4 = 6; incorrect result: x^6)
- Solving exponential equations: 2^x * 2^3 = 2^10 (adding powers: x + 3 = 10; incorrect solution: x = 7)"
2525,"When dividing decimals, divides rather than multiplies when reinserting the decimal.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing decimals and need to reinsert the decimal point in the quotient. They incorrectly assume that they should divide the quotient to determine the correct placement of the decimal point, rather than multiplying the divisor by a power of 10 (or moving the decimal point accordingly) to maintain the correct place value.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When dividing a decimal by a whole number, such as 12.5 ÷ 5, and the student incorrectly divides the quotient instead of considering the decimal places.
- When performing long division with decimals, such as 15.6 ÷ 0.3, and the student misplaces the decimal point in the quotient due to incorrect division or failure to account for the divisor's decimal places.
- When solving word problems involving decimal division, such as calculating the number of groups of a certain size that can be made from a given quantity, and the student incorrectly applies the division algorithm, leading to an incorrect placement of the decimal point."
2526,Believes a downward line has a positive gradient,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of gradient in a linear equation. They may think that a line that slopes downward from left to right has a positive gradient, possibly because they associate ""downward"" with a positive direction, or because they misunderstand the relationship between the x and y axes. In reality, the gradient of a line is determined by the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run), with a negative gradient indicating a downward slope.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

- When graphing a linear equation and determining its gradient, a student may incorrectly label a downward-sloping line as having a positive gradient.
- When comparing the gradients of multiple lines, a student may incorrectly conclude that a downward-sloping line has a greater gradient than an upward-sloping line.
- When solving problems involving the gradient of a line, such as finding the equation of a line or determining the rate of change, a student may incorrectly use a positive gradient for a downward-sloping line."
2527,"Writes a repeated root once, rather than in a squared bracket","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are factoring or finding the roots of a quadratic equation. They may understand that a repeated root means the equation has two identical solutions, but they incorrectly notate this by writing the root only once, rather than indicating the multiplicity of the root by writing it in squared brackets or with an exponent of 2. For example, if the quadratic equation is x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0, students with this misconception might write the solution as x = -2, instead of the correct notation x = (-2)^2 or x = [-2, -2].

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When factoring a quadratic equation with a repeated root, such as x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0.
- When solving a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula and obtaining a repeated root, such as x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0.
- When graphing a quadratic function and identifying the x-intercepts, which represent the roots of the equation, such as y = x^2 - 4x + 4."
2528,Thinks that the perimeter on a square grid is the number of squares surrounding the rectangle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to find the perimeter of a shape drawn on a square grid. They mistakenly believe that the perimeter is equal to the number of squares that surround the shape, rather than the total distance around the shape. This misconception is likely due to the visual representation of the grid, where each square has a fixed length, leading students to focus on counting the number of squares rather than calculating the actual distance.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

* Finding the perimeter of a rectangle drawn on a square grid, where the student counts the number of squares along the edges of the rectangle instead of calculating the total distance.
* Calculating the perimeter of a shape that is not a rectangle, such as a triangle or a more complex polygon, where the student incorrectly applies the same method of counting surrounding squares.
* Comparing the perimeters of different shapes on a grid, where the student mistakenly concludes that the shape with more surrounding squares has a larger perimeter."
2529,Does not think a ton is a unit of mass,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or misunderstand the unit 'ton' as a measurement of mass, often due to its less frequent use in everyday contexts or a lack of exposure to real-world applications where the term 'ton' is used to express large quantities of mass. Students might mistakenly think of 'ton' as being related to volume or capacity, or not recognize it as a legitimate unit of mass alongside more commonly used units such as grams or kilograms.

Short cases where the misconception will occur:

- When comparing the mass of large objects, such as vehicles or buildings, and the unit 'ton' is used (e.g., ""The ship weighs 10,000 tons"").
- In problems involving the conversion between units of mass, where 'ton' is one of the options (e.g., converting 1 ton to kilograms).
- In discussions about large-scale measurements, such as the amount of waste recycled or the mass of goods transported, where 'ton' is used as the unit of measurement (e.g., ""The recycling plant processed 500 tons of waste last year"")."
2530,Subtracts instead of adds when using inverse operations to solve an equation,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are solving linear equations and need to isolate the variable by getting rid of a constant term on the same side as the variable. Instead of adding the constant to both sides of the equation (which is the inverse operation of subtraction), they subtract it, thinking that this will 'cancel out' the constant. 

For example, this misconception might occur in the following cases:

- When solving an equation like 3x - 5 = 7, a student might subtract 5 from both sides instead of adding 5 to both sides.
- When solving an equation like x - 2 = 9, a student might subtract 2 from both sides instead of adding 2 to both sides.
- When solving an equation like 2x - 4 = 10, a student might subtract 4 from both sides instead of adding 4 to both sides."
2531,Does not understand that the volume of an enlarged shape is the volume of the original multiplied by the cube of the scale factor of the lengths.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to recognize that when a 3D shape is enlarged by a certain scale factor, its volume increases at a much faster rate than its surface area or linear dimensions. They may incorrectly assume that the volume scales by the same factor as the lengths or areas, rather than understanding that the volume scales by the cube of the scale factor.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

* When a cube with side length 2 cm is enlarged to have a side length of 4 cm, students may think the volume is multiplied by 2, rather than 2^3 = 8.
* When a sphere with radius 3 cm is enlarged to have a radius of 6 cm, students may believe the volume is multiplied by 2, rather than 2^3 = 8.
* When a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 cm x 3 cm x 4 cm is enlarged to have dimensions 4 cm x 6 cm x 8 cm, students may incorrectly calculate the volume by multiplying the original volume by 2, rather than 2^3 = 8."
2532,Believes order of operations does not affect the answer to a calculation,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students believe that the order in which they perform mathematical operations (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) does not impact the final result of a calculation. They may assume that as long as all operations are included, the order is irrelevant. This misconception neglects the fundamental principles of the order of operations, which is a set of rules that dictate the sequence in which mathematical operations should be performed when more than one operation is present in an expression.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. Calculating the expression 3 + 4 × 5, where the student may add 3 and 4 first and then multiply the result by 5, instead of following the correct order of operations.
2. Evaluating the expression 12 - 3 + 2, where the student may subtract 3 from 12 and then add 2, but in a different order, such as adding 2 to 12 and then subtracting 3.
3. Solving the expression 9 ÷ 3 + 2 × 4, where the student may divide 9 by 3 and then add 2, followed by multiplying the result by 4, rather than following the correct order of operations.
4. Simplifying the expression 10 - 2 + 8 ÷ 2, where the student may subtract 2 from 10, then add 8, and finally divide the result by 2, instead of following the correct order of operations."
2533,Does not realise that two letters together are multiplying,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are introduced to algebra and are not fully aware that when two letters or variables are written together, such as 'ab' or 'xy', it implies multiplication. They may interpret the letters as a single entity or a new variable, rather than understanding that they represent the product of two separate variables.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When simplifying expressions, for example, '2ab' may be thought of as a single variable rather than '2 times a times b'.
- When expanding expressions, such as '(a + b)(c + d)', students may not recognize that 'ac' and 'bd' involve multiplication.
- When solving equations, for example, 'ab = 6', students may not realize that 'a' and 'b' are multiplied together to equal 6.

This misconception can lead to difficulties in understanding and working with algebraic expressions, and it's essential to address it early on to ensure students build a strong foundation in algebra."
2534,When converting between non standard form and standard form assumes changes to the base will not affect the power,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are converting numbers between non-standard form and standard form, particularly with numbers that have a base raised to a power. They may assume that changing the base of the number will not affect the power to which it is raised. For example, when converting the number 8 × 10^3 to a different base, such as base 2, they may incorrectly assume that the power of 3 remains the same.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Converting between different bases, such as from base 10 to base 2 or base 5, and assuming the power remains the same.
- Rewriting numbers in non-standard form, such as 64 as 8^2 or 2^6, and then incorrectly converting them to a different base.
- Simplifying algebraic expressions involving exponents, such as (2^3)^2, and incorrectly applying the rules of exponents when changing the base.
- Solving problems involving exponential growth or decay, where the base and power are changed, but the student assumes the power remains constant.
- Interpreting scientific notation, such as 1.2 × 10^4, and incorrectly converting it to a different base or assuming the power remains the same."
2535,Does not add on 180 degrees when using a protractor to measure a reflex angle,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are using a protractor to measure a reflex angle, but they fail to add 180 degrees to the reading obtained from the protractor. A protractor typically only measures up to 180 degrees, so when measuring a reflex angle (an angle greater than 180 degrees), students need to add 180 degrees to the protractor reading to obtain the correct measure. However, some students may forget or misunderstand this step, leading to incorrect measurements.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When measuring the angle between two intersecting lines that form a reflex angle.
* When finding the measure of a reflex angle in a polygon, such as the interior angle of a concave polygon.
* When solving problems involving the sum of interior angles of a polygon, where some of the angles are reflex angles.
* When working with bearings and directions, where angles greater than 180 degrees are common.
* When solving trigonometry problems involving reflex angles in right-angled triangles."
2536,Misunderstands the capture-recapture method,"Explanation: The capture-recapture method is a statistical technique used to estimate the size of a population. A common misconception is that the method provides an exact count of the population, rather than an estimate. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the assumptions underlying the method, such as the assumption that the population is closed (i.e., no individuals enter or leave the population during the study period) and that the probability of capture is the same for all individuals.

Students may believe that by capturing a certain number of individuals, marking them, and then releasing them back into the population, they can then capture a second group and use the overlap between the two groups to determine the exact size of the population. However, this method is actually used to estimate the population size based on the ratio of marked to unmarked individuals in the second capture.

This misconception may occur in cases such as:

* A student is tasked with estimating the number of fish in a pond and assumes that the capture-recapture method will give an exact count.
* A researcher is studying a population of birds and uses the capture-recapture method to estimate the population size, but incorrectly reports the estimate as an exact count.
* A student is analyzing data from a capture-recapture study and assumes that the method is 100% accurate, rather than recognizing the potential for error and variability in the estimate."
2537,Does not know the definition of a rational number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unclear about what constitutes a rational number. They may believe that rational numbers are only whole numbers or integers, or they may think that rational numbers include all decimal numbers. This misunderstanding can lead to difficulties in identifying and working with rational numbers, including fractions and decimals.

In particular, students with this misconception may struggle to:

- Identify rational numbers in their various forms (e.g., fractions, decimals, and percentages)
- Distinguish between rational and irrational numbers
- Understand the concept of equivalent ratios and how they relate to rational numbers
- Perform arithmetic operations with rational numbers

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When simplifying fractions, students may not recognize that the result is a rational number (e.g., simplifying 4/8 to 1/2)
- When comparing decimal numbers, students may not understand that certain decimals are rational numbers (e.g., 0.5 or 0.25)
- When working with percentages, students may not recognize that percentages are a form of rational number (e.g., 25% as a fraction is 1/4)"
2538,Confuses the value of the variable with cumulative frequency,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of cumulative frequency in data analysis and statistics. They tend to confuse the value of a variable (the actual data point) with the cumulative frequency, which is the total number of observations up to a certain value. This can lead to incorrect interpretations of data and graphs.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When reading a cumulative frequency graph, a student may incorrectly identify the value of the variable (e.g., the number of hours spent studying) with the cumulative frequency (e.g., the total number of students who studied up to a certain number of hours).
- When analyzing a dataset, a student may mistakenly use the cumulative frequency instead of the actual data values to calculate means, medians, or other statistical measures.
- When interpreting a box plot or histogram, a student may confuse the variable values (e.g., exam scores) with the cumulative frequencies, leading to incorrect conclusions about the data distribution."
2539,Believes the inverse of square rooting is halving,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the inverse operation of finding the square root of a number is halving the number. In other words, they think that if the square root of a number is the operation that ""reverses"" squaring a number, then the inverse operation would be to simply divide the number by 2. This misconception may stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of inverse operations and a lack of understanding of the relationship between squaring and square rooting.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When students are asked to find the inverse operation of finding the square root of a number, they may respond by halving the number. For example, if asked to find the inverse operation of √16, they may respond with 16 ÷ 2 = 8.
* When solving algebraic equations involving square roots, students may attempt to ""cancel out"" the square root by halving the number. For example, in the equation √x = 4, they may try to solve for x by dividing 4 by 2.
* When working with geometric shapes and sizes, students may mistakenly believe that halving the area of a shape is equivalent to finding the square root of the area. For example, if a square has an area of 16 square units, they may think that halving the area (i.e., dividing by 2) will give them the length of one side of the square."
2540,Confuses maximum and minimum,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the terms 'maximum' and 'minimum' in various mathematical contexts, such as data analysis, graph interpretation, or even simple number comparisons. They may mistakenly identify the largest value as the minimum or the smallest value as the maximum. This confusion can lead to incorrect answers and interpretations in problems involving data analysis, graphing, or optimization.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: In a dataset, the student is asked to find the maximum and minimum values, but they swap the answers, identifying the largest value as the minimum and the smallest value as the maximum.

- Case 2: When analyzing a graph, the student incorrectly identifies the highest point as the minimum and the lowest point as the maximum.

- Case 3: In a simple comparison problem, the student is asked to find the maximum or minimum value from a set of numbers, but they choose the wrong one, such as selecting the smallest number as the maximum.

- Case 4: In a real-world application, such as measuring temperatures, the student mistakenly identifies the highest temperature as the minimum and the lowest temperature as the maximum."
2541,"When finding the square root of a decimal, believes the answer should have the same number of decimal places","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly apply the rule for multiplying and dividing decimals to finding square roots. They may believe that if a decimal number has a certain number of decimal places, then its square root must also have the same number of decimal places. For example, they might think that the square root of 0.16 should have 2 decimal places because 0.16 has 2 decimal places.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Finding the square root of 0.25, where students might answer 0.50 instead of 0.5.
- Calculating the square root of 0.81, where students might respond with 0.90 instead of 0.9.
- Determining the square root of 0.0016, where students might write 0.040 instead of 0.04.

This misconception highlights the need for students to understand the concept of square roots and how they differ from other mathematical operations involving decimals."
2542,Believes that dividing by a decimal is the same as dividing by its reciprocal,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly assume that dividing by a decimal is equivalent to dividing by its reciprocal. For instance, they might think that dividing by 0.5 is the same as dividing by 2 (since 1/0.5 = 2), but incorrectly apply this logic to the division operation itself, rather than converting the division to multiplication by the reciprocal.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- When dividing a number by a decimal in a simple arithmetic problem (e.g., 10 ÷ 0.2).
- When solving real-world problems that involve dividing by decimals, like calculating the cost per unit of an item priced at $0.50.
- When working with ratios or proportions that involve decimals.
- When performing calculations involving percentages or interest rates expressed as decimals.
- When solving algebraic equations that involve division by decimals."
2543,"Believes the frequency represented by a pie chart sector can be judged visually, without considering the total it represents","Explanation: This misconception arises when students interpret pie charts by solely relying on visual inspection to compare the size of sectors, without taking into account the actual values or the total that the pie chart represents. They may assume that a sector that appears larger in one pie chart represents a greater frequency than a sector in another pie chart that appears smaller, without considering the different totals of each chart.

For instance, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Comparing two pie charts showing favorite colors of students in two different classes. One class has 100 students and the other has 50 students. A student might conclude that a color sector in the first class's pie chart is more popular than the same color sector in the second class's pie chart simply because it appears larger, without considering the difference in total number of students.
- Case 2: Analyzing a pie chart showing the distribution of sales of different products, where the total sales figure is not provided. A student might assume that a product with a sector that appears to be one-third of the pie chart has sold more units than a product with a sector that appears to be one-quarter of a different pie chart, without considering the actual sales totals.
- Case 3: Interpreting a pie chart showing the proportion of different age groups in a population. A student might conclude that a particular age group is more prominent in one population than in another based solely on the visual size of the sector, without taking into account the total population size."
2544,Confuses reciprocal and exponential graphs,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to differentiate between the graphs of reciprocal functions (e.g., 1/x) and exponential functions (e.g., 2^x). They may incorrectly identify or plot the graphs, leading to misunderstandings about the behavior and characteristics of these functions. Students may mistakenly think that both types of functions exhibit the same type of growth or decay, or they may confuse the shapes of the graphs.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- Case 1: Graphing 1/x and 2^x on the same coordinate plane, where students might incorrectly label or identify the graphs.
- Case 2: Analyzing real-world problems, such as population growth or chemical reactions, where students might mistakenly apply the characteristics of one type of function to the other.
- Case 3: Solving equations involving reciprocal or exponential functions, where students might incorrectly apply algebraic manipulations due to their misunderstanding of the graphs.
- Case 4: Interpreting data and making predictions based on the wrong type of function, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- Case 5: Comparing the growth rates of different functions, where students might mistakenly conclude that a reciprocal function grows faster or slower than an exponential function."
2545,Does not know that prime numbers have exactly two factors,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unable to fully grasp the definition of prime numbers. They may believe that prime numbers have more or fewer than two factors, often due to a lack of understanding of what factors are or how to identify them correctly. For example, students might think that the number 1 is a prime number because it has only one factor (1 itself), or they might incorrectly assume that a number like 4 is prime because they are not considering all possible factors.

This misconception can occur in various situations, such as:

- When students are asked to list prime numbers and include numbers with more than two factors (e.g., 4, 6, 8) or fewer than two factors (e.g., 1).
- When students are given a number and asked to determine if it is prime, but they fail to check all possible factors, leading to incorrect conclusions.
- When students are working on problems that involve finding prime factors of a composite number and struggle to identify the prime numbers involved due to their misunderstanding of the definition."
2546,Confuses the hundreds and tens place value columns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the positional notation of numbers in the hundreds and tens place value columns. They may mistakenly assign the value of the hundreds place to the tens place or vice versa. This confusion can lead to incorrect calculations, such as when adding or subtracting numbers with multiple digits.

For example, when writing the number 541, a student with this misconception may incorrectly identify the 4 as the tens digit and the 5 as a ones digit with a value in the tens column (e.g., 500 + 4 + 10 + 1, instead of 500 + 40 + 1). 

Short cases when the misconception will occur:
1. When writing numbers with three or more digits.
2. When performing arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction involving numbers with multiple digits.
3. When comparing numbers and identifying their place value.
4. When rounding numbers to the nearest ten or hundred.
5. When solving word problems involving multi-digit numbers."
2547,Multiplies instead of divides when division is written as a fraction,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly interpret the division symbol, often represented as a fraction, as a multiplication operation. In other words, they incorrectly assume that the top number (numerator) should be multiplied by the bottom number (denominator) instead of being divided by it. This error can stem from a misunderstanding of the concept of fractions or the notation used to represent division.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- When simplifying a fraction, such as 6 ÷ 2 written as 6/2, students might multiply 6 and 2 instead of dividing, getting 12 instead of 3.
- When solving a problem like ""Tom has 18 cookies and wants to share them equally among 3 friends,"" students might write 18/3 but multiply 18 and 3, resulting in 54 cookies instead of 6 cookies per friend.
- In algebra, when solving equations involving fractions, such as x/4 = 5, students may multiply x by 4 instead of dividing, leading to an incorrect solution."
2548,Does not increase the denominator when an item is added in a probability question,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students fail to update the total number of outcomes (denominator) in a probability question after an item is added to the sample space. Students may only focus on the numerator (number of favorable outcomes) and neglect to adjust the denominator to reflect the new total number of possible outcomes. As a result, they may calculate the probability incorrectly.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A bag contains 5 red balls and 3 blue balls. If 2 more blue balls are added, what is the probability of drawing a blue ball? (Student may incorrectly use the original denominator of 8 instead of the updated denominator of 10.)
- A deck of cards has 52 cards, and 2 more cards are added. What is the probability of drawing a specific card? (Student may incorrectly use the original denominator of 52 instead of the updated denominator of 54.)
- A box contains 8 toys, 3 of which are cars. If 2 more toys are added, and one of them is a car, what is the probability of randomly selecting a car from the box? (Student may incorrectly use the original denominator of 8 instead of the updated denominator of 10.)"
2549,Believes only the first term needs to be divided when factorising an expression,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to factorization, specifically when factorizing expressions by taking out a common factor. They may mistakenly believe that only the first term of the expression needs to be divided by the common factor, rather than dividing every term by the common factor. 

For example, when factorizing the expression 6x + 12, students with this misconception may divide only the first term (6x) by the common factor (6), resulting in x + 12, instead of dividing both terms by 6, which would give the correct factorization of 6(x + 2).

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Factorizing expressions with common factors: 9x + 15 (dividing only 9x by 3, instead of dividing both terms by 3)
- Simplifying algebraic expressions: 8x + 16 (dividing only 8x by 8, instead of dividing both terms by 8)
- Solving equations: 4x + 20 = 0 (dividing only 4x by 4, instead of dividing both terms by 4)"
2550,Thinks there are 10m in a km,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that there are 10 meters in a kilometer, rather than 1000 meters. This error may be due to a misunderstanding of the metric system or a lack of understanding of the prefixes used in measurement units. 

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting distances from kilometers to meters, students may write 1 km as 10 m instead of 1000 m.
- When solving problems involving distances, such as calculating the total distance traveled, students may use the incorrect conversion factor, leading to incorrect answers.
- When comparing lengths or distances, students may incorrectly assume that 1 km is only slightly longer than 1 m, rather than 1000 times longer.
- When working with real-world applications, such as measuring the distance between two cities, students may incorrectly estimate the distance in meters if they believe there are only 10 meters in a kilometer."
2551,Believes range does not need units,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students understand that range is a measure of spread or dispersion but fail to recognize it as a quantity with units. They might believe that range, being the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset, is just a number without any associated units. This is because they may focus solely on the numerical value of the difference and overlook the fact that this difference is still a quantity measured in the same units as the original data.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Calculating the range of the heights of students in a class, a student might say ""the range is 20"" instead of ""the range is 20 cm"".
- Finding the range of temperatures recorded over a week, a student might write ""the range is 15"" instead of ""the range is 15°C"".
- Determining the range of times taken to complete a task, a student might say ""the range is 5"" instead of ""the range is 5 minutes""."
2552,"When adding decimals, thinks the answer has to have the same number of decimals as the total in the question","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the number of decimal places in the answer must match the total number of decimal places in the question. For example, if the question asks to add 2.5 and 3.8, a student with this misconception might think the answer must have 2 decimal places because there are 2 numbers with a total of 3 decimal places (2 in 2.5 and 1 in 3.8) but since 2.5 only has one number after the decimal, they then assume the answer must have 2 numbers after the decimal (like 2.5+3.8 does have 2 numbers in the answer but not for this reason) but more because they made an assumption about the total amount of numbers after the decimal points being the same as the amount of numbers after the decimal point in the question.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Adding 4.25 and 2.7, the student might think the answer must have 3 decimal places.
- Adding 1.5 and 2.25, the student might think the answer must have 2 decimal places.
- Adding 3.8 and 1.25, the student might think the answer must have 2 decimal places."
2553,Gives the second significant figure when asked for the first,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are asked to identify the first significant figure of a number but instead provide the second significant figure. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the rules for identifying significant figures. Students may be incorrectly counting the digits in a number or incorrectly applying the rules for significant figures, such as ignoring leading zeros or failing to recognize that certain numbers have implied leading zeros.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When a number has multiple non-zero digits, e.g., 456. Students may incorrectly identify the '5' as the first significant figure is correct but when asked for the first significant figure of the number 4056, they may incorrectly give '5' instead of '4'.
- When a number has a decimal point and non-zero digits after the decimal point, e.g., 0.045. Students may incorrectly identify the '4' as the second significant figure when it is actually the first.
- When a number is written in scientific notation, e.g., 4.56 x 10^3. Students may incorrectly identify the '5' as the first significant figure when it is actually the second."
2554,Thinks the diagonal of a square is the same length as the side of the square,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students have a limited understanding of geometry, particularly with regards to the properties of squares. They may assume that because a square has equal sides, the diagonal, which is a line connecting two opposite corners, must also be the same length as the sides. This misconception might stem from a lack of exposure to or understanding of the Pythagorean theorem, which is used to calculate the length of the diagonal in a square.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When asked to draw a square and label its dimensions, including the diagonal, students may label the diagonal with the same length as the side.
- When solving problems involving the perimeter of a square, students may incorrectly include the diagonal as having the same length as the side.
- When calculating the length of a diagonal in a square, students may provide the length of the side instead of using the Pythagorean theorem to find the correct length.
- When comparing the lengths of different segments in a square, students may incorrectly state that the diagonal and side are equal in length."
2555,Does not understand how to find a scale factor,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students struggle to comprehend the concept of a scale factor, which is a ratio of the size of a model or drawing to the actual size of the object it represents. They may not understand that the scale factor is a multiplier that is used to enlarge or reduce the size of a shape or object, while maintaining its proportions. Students with this misconception may not know how to calculate the scale factor, or they may incorrectly apply it, leading to distorted or incorrectly sized representations of the object.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When asked to enlarge or reduce a shape by a certain scale factor, students may multiply or divide the dimensions incorrectly, or apply the scale factor to only one dimension instead of all.
* When given a scale drawing, students may not be able to identify the scale factor used to create it, or they may not be able to use the scale factor to determine the actual size of the object.
* When comparing similar shapes, students may not understand how to use the scale factor to determine the ratio of their corresponding sides.
* When solving problems involving proportional relationships, students may not recognize that the scale factor is a constant of proportionality that can be used to make predictions or solve for unknown values.
* When working with maps or blueprints, students may not be able to apply the scale factor to determine the actual distance between locations or the size of features."
2556,Thinks the subtraction sign means multiply,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the subtraction sign (-) represents multiplication instead of the actual operation of finding the difference between two numbers. They might interpret the subtraction sign as an instruction to multiply the number by a certain value, rather than subtracting one value from another. This misunderstanding can lead to incorrect calculations and confusion in various mathematical contexts.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When subtracting negative numbers, students might multiply the numbers instead of applying the rules of subtracting negative numbers.
- When dealing with algebraic expressions, students might incorrectly multiply terms with negative coefficients instead of subtracting them.
- In word problems, students might misinterpret the subtraction sign and multiply the given values, leading to incorrect solutions.
- When solving problems involving temperatures, students might multiply the temperature difference instead of subtracting, resulting in incorrect answers."
2557,Mixes up cubing and squaring,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the mathematical operations of cubing and squaring. Squaring a number involves multiplying the number by itself (e.g., 2² = 2 × 2), whereas cubing involves multiplying the number by itself twice (e.g., 2³ = 2 × 2 × 2). Students may incorrectly apply the rules of squaring when asked to cube a number or vice versa, often due to a lack of understanding of the notation (² for squaring and ³ for cubing) or the meaning behind the operations.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

1. Calculating the volume of a cube: A student is asked to find the volume of a cube with a side length of 4 units. They may incorrectly square the side length (4² = 16) instead of cubing it (4³ = 64).

2. Simplifying algebraic expressions: Given the expression (2x)³, a student may incorrectly expand it as (2x)² = 4x² instead of the correct expansion (2x)³ = 8x³.

3. Solving numerical problems: A student is asked to evaluate the expression 3³. They may incorrectly calculate 3² = 9 instead of the correct result 3³ = 27.

4. Real-world applications: When calculating the volume of a container or the area of a three-dimensional object, students may mistakenly apply the rules of squaring instead of cubing, leading to incorrect results."
2558,"When writing fraction from diagram, writes total as denominator","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to write a fraction based on a diagram or picture that represents a part of a whole. The student mistakenly assumes that the total number of parts or objects in the diagram should always be the denominator of the fraction, without considering the actual number of equal parts that the whole is divided into, or the specific part being referred to.

For example, this misconception will occur in the following cases:

- A diagram shows 5 red apples and 3 green apples in a basket, and the student is asked to write a fraction to represent the red apples. The student may incorrectly write 5/8, using the total number of apples as the denominator.
- A picture shows a pizza divided into 8 slices, with 3 of them eaten. If the student is asked to write a fraction to represent the part of the pizza that has been eaten, they may incorrectly write 3/8 if there are 5 uneaten slices and 3 other objects (like plates or cups) in the picture.
- A diagram shows a toy box with 6 toy cars and 4 toy trucks. If the student is asked to write a fraction to represent the toy cars, they may incorrectly write 6/10, using the total number of toys as the denominator."
2559,When dividing numbers with different bases subtracts the powers but divides the base numbers.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers with different bases in the context of indices or exponents. They may mistakenly believe that when dividing these numbers, they need to subtract the powers (exponents) but divide the base numbers. For example, when dividing 8^4 by 2^2, students with this misconception might think they should divide 8 by 2 and then subtract the powers (4 - 2), resulting in an incorrect calculation.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Dividing 6^3 by 3^2
- Calculating 9^5 ÷ 3^1
- Solving 2^6 ÷ 4^2
- Working out 8^2 ÷ 2^1
- Finding the result of 5^4 ÷ 25^2"
2560,Confuses the formulas for the perimeter of a sector and the area of a sector ,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students get mixed up between the formulas for calculating the perimeter (also known as the arc length) of a sector and the area of a sector. The perimeter of a sector is the distance around the curved part of the sector, while the area of a sector is the amount of space inside the sector. Students may incorrectly apply the formula for one to the other, leading to incorrect calculations.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When finding the perimeter of a sector, students may mistakenly use the formula for the area, which involves the radius squared, instead of the formula that involves the radius and the angle.
- When finding the area of a sector, students may mistakenly use the formula for the perimeter, which involves the radius and the angle, instead of the formula that involves the radius squared and the angle.
- When solving problems that involve both the perimeter and area of a sector, students may get confused and apply the wrong formula to each, leading to incorrect answers.
- When dealing with real-world applications, such as designing circular paths or calculating the area of a pie chart, students may apply the wrong formula, leading to practical errors."
2561,"Believes a sample space should show repeated outcomes, not just unique possible outcomes.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that a sample space should include every single outcome that can occur, including repeated ones, rather than just listing each unique possible outcome. They may think that if an event can happen multiple times, it should be represented multiple times in the sample space. For instance, when rolling a die, they might think the sample space should include multiple instances of each number (e.g., 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, etc.) rather than just listing each unique outcome once (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When creating a sample space for coin tosses, students might list 'heads' and 'tails' multiple times to account for multiple tosses, rather than just listing each outcome once.
- When determining the sample space for drawing colored balls from a bag, students may include repeated instances of each color, rather than just listing each unique color.
- When constructing a sample space for rolling multiple dice, students may include repeated combinations of numbers, rather than just listing each unique combination."
2562,Confuses the lower and upper bound,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty distinguishing between the lower and upper bounds of a measurement or a range. In measurement, the lower bound is the smallest possible value, while the upper bound is the largest possible value. Students may mistakenly swap these values or fail to recognize that the true measurement lies between these bounds. This misconception can be observed in various math topics, such as measuring lengths, weights, and capacities, as well as when working with inequalities and ranges in algebra and statistics.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When measuring the length of a pencil, a student might record 15cm as the lower bound and 14cm as the upper bound, instead of the other way around.
- In an inequality, a student might write 3 < x < 2, where 3 is the upper bound instead of the lower bound.
- When calculating the range of a dataset, a student might mistake the smallest value as the upper bound and the largest value as the lower bound.
- When reading a measurement from a scale or a ruler, a student might misinterpret the markings, leading to a mix-up between the lower and upper bounds of the measurement."
2563,Believes to complete a part whole model you select a value already given in the model,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that when using a part-whole model to solve problems, particularly in the context of fractions, ratios, or percentages, they can only select values that are already given in the model to complete it. They may not realize that they can use reasoning, calculations, or other strategies to find the missing values. As a result, they may incorrectly assume that the answer must be one of the existing values within the model, limiting their ability to think critically and solve problems effectively.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- A student is given a part-whole model representing 1/4 of a pizza and is asked to find the fraction of the remaining pizza. They may assume that the answer must be one of the existing fractions shown in the model, rather than calculating the actual remaining fraction.
- A student is presented with a ratio problem, where a part-whole model shows 2:5. They are asked to find the missing part when the whole is 15. The student may incorrectly assume that the answer must be one of the existing numbers in the ratio, rather than using proportional reasoning to find the correct answer.
- A student is working with percentages and is given a part-whole model showing 25% of a quantity. They are asked to find the remaining percentage. The student may mistakenly believe that the answer must be one of the existing percentages shown in the model, rather than calculating the actual remaining percentage."
2564,Gives the intersect value of a Venn diagram when asked to find the value of a set only,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the concept of set notation and Venn diagrams. They tend to focus on the intersection or overlap of two or more sets, rather than the individual set itself. When asked to find the value of a specific set, they incorrectly provide the value of the intersection, rather than the total value of the set. This misconception shows a lack of understanding of set theory and the ability to distinguish between the intersection, union, and individual sets.

Short cases where this misconception will occur:

- When students are asked to find the number of elements in a specific set (e.g., ""How many students are in the soccer team?""), they may provide the number of students who are in both the soccer team and another team (e.g., the debate team), rather than the total number of students in the soccer team.
- When working with Venn diagrams, students may incorrectly label the intersection as the value of one of the sets, rather than calculating the total value of the set.
- In word problems involving sets, students may misinterpret the question and provide the intersection value instead of the individual set value (e.g., ""If 10 students like pizza and 5 students like both pizza and ice cream, how many students like pizza?"")."
2565,Confuses the hundreds and thousands place value columns,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students misunderstand the positional notation of digits within a number, particularly in the hundreds and thousands place value columns. Students with this misconception may believe that the hundreds column is where the thousands digit should be, and vice versa, leading to incorrect reading and writing of numbers. They may also struggle to understand the concept of ""shifting"" digits to the left or right when multiplying or dividing by powers of 10.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

* When writing numbers in standard form, students may place the thousands digit in the hundreds column, e.g., writing 1,500 as 150.
* When reading numbers aloud, students may mispronounce the number, e.g., saying ""one hundred fifty"" instead of ""one thousand five hundred"".
* When performing arithmetic operations, such as addition or subtraction, students may misalign the numbers, leading to incorrect calculations.
* When rounding numbers to the nearest hundred or thousand, students may apply the wrong rules, leading to incorrect answers."
2566,"When subtracting a negative number, subtracts the absolute value rather than adding it","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are not fully comfortable with the concept of negative numbers and how they interact with different mathematical operations, particularly subtraction. They might interpret subtracting a negative number as simply removing a quantity, rather than understanding it as the addition of its positive counterpart. This misunderstanding leads them to subtract the absolute value of the negative number, instead of adding it, which results in an incorrect calculation.

Cases when the misconception will occur:

- Subtracting negative numbers in basic arithmetic operations: For example, when asked to calculate 5 - (-3), students with this misconception might respond with 2 (5 - 3), instead of the correct answer, 8 (5 + 3).
- Solving algebraic expressions: When faced with expressions like x - (-2), students may incorrectly simplify it to x - 2, instead of x + 2.
- Interpreting temperature changes or other real-world applications: If a temperature drops by -4 degrees, students with this misconception might think it has decreased by 4 degrees, rather than understanding that it has actually increased by 4 degrees.
- Evaluating numerical expressions within word problems: For instance, if a bank account balance decreases by -£10, students might incorrectly assume the balance has decreased by £10, instead of realizing it has increased by £10."
2567,Believes they only need to multiply the first pair of terms when expanding a double bracket.,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to expanding double brackets in algebra, typically in the form of (a + b)(c + d). They may incorrectly assume that they only need to multiply the first terms of each bracket, i.e., 'a' and 'c', and ignore the other terms. This results in an incomplete expansion, where they only consider the product of the first pair of terms, ac, and neglect the other products, such as ad, bc, and bd.

Short cases where this misconception may occur:

- Expanding (x + 2)(x + 3) and only getting x^2
- Expanding (2x + 1)(x + 4) and only getting 2x^2
- Expanding (x - 2)(x + 5) and only getting x^2"
2568,Believes all the multiples of a number will also be multiples of its multiples,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students misunderstand the relationship between multiples of a number and its factors. They may assume that if a number 'a' is a multiple of another number 'b', then all multiples of 'a' will also be multiples of all multiples of 'b'. This shows a lack of understanding of how factors and multiples are related. Students with this misconception may struggle to identify the correct multiples of a number or make incorrect assumptions about the divisibility of certain numbers.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- A student is asked to list all the multiples of 4 that are also multiples of 8, and they incorrectly include multiples of 2.
- When identifying the common multiples of 3 and 9, a student incorrectly assumes that all multiples of 3 are also multiples of 9.
- In a problem that requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 6 and 12, a student incorrectly states that all multiples of 6 are also multiples of 12, and therefore incorrectly identifies the LCM."
2569,Confuses pentagon and hexagon,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students have difficulty in identifying and differentiating between a pentagon and a hexagon. A pentagon is a polygon with five sides, while a hexagon is a polygon with six sides. Students with this misconception may mistakenly identify a pentagon as a hexagon or vice versa due to their inability to accurately count the number of sides or due to a lack of understanding of the defining characteristics of each shape.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When students are shown a diagram of a polygon with five or six sides and are asked to identify the shape, they may incorrectly label it as the other shape.
- When students are given a problem that involves counting the number of sides of a polygon, they may miscount the sides and incorrectly identify the shape.
- When students are asked to draw a specific polygon, such as a pentagon or hexagon, they may draw the incorrect shape due to their confusion.
- When students are working with real-world objects that have pentagonal or hexagonal shapes, such as tiles or building blocks, they may misidentify the shape of the object."
2570,Confuses interior angles with exterior angles,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students mistakenly identify or calculate interior angles of a shape as exterior angles, or vice versa. They may incorrectly apply properties or theorems related to one type of angle to the other, leading to incorrect conclusions or calculations. For example, students might think that the sum of exterior angles of a polygon is not always 360 degrees, or that the sum of interior angles of a triangle is not always 180 degrees.

Short cases where the misconception may occur:

- When asked to find the sum of interior angles of a polygon, a student may provide the sum of exterior angles instead.
- When solving problems involving the angles of a triangle, a student may confuse the interior angle sum with the exterior angle sum.
- In geometric construction problems, students may incorrectly label or measure interior angles as exterior angles, leading to incorrect calculations.
- When working with circle theorems, students may confuse the relationship between interior and exterior angles subtended by the same arc.
- In 3D geometry, students may struggle to visualize and correctly identify interior and exterior angles of 3D shapes."
2571,"When dividing numbers with different bases, divides the powers and divides the base numbers.","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are dividing numbers with different bases, particularly when dealing with exponential expressions. They may incorrectly assume that they can simply divide the powers (exponents) and divide the base numbers separately, without considering the properties of exponents and the relationship between the bases.

For example, when dividing 6^4 by 3^2, students with this misconception may incorrectly calculate (6 ÷ 3)^ (4 ÷ 2), resulting in 2^2 = 4, which is not the correct answer.

This misconception can occur in various cases, such as:

- Dividing numbers with different bases in algebraic expressions: 10^3 / 5^2
- Simplifying complex fractions with exponential expressions: (8^3) / (4^2)
- Solving problems involving exponential growth or decay: A population grows from 2^5 to 4^3, find the growth rate.
- Evaluating numerical expressions involving exponents: 9^2 / 3^3"
2572,Rotates by the wrong center of rotation (not including the origin),"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are asked to rotate a shape or object by a certain angle, but they incorrectly identify the center of rotation. Instead of rotating the shape around the specified center of rotation, they rotate it around a different point, often the origin (0, 0) or another conspicuous point on the shape. This can lead to an incorrect image of the rotated shape.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: A student is asked to rotate a triangle 90 degrees clockwise around the midpoint of one of its sides, but they rotate it around the origin instead.
- Case 2: A student is given a circle with a marked center point and asked to rotate it 180 degrees around that center point. However, they mistakenly rotate the circle around the center of the coordinate grid (the origin).
- Case 3: A student is asked to rotate a rectangle 270 degrees counterclockwise around one of its vertices, but they choose the wrong vertex as the center of rotation, resulting in an incorrect image."
2573,Believes the solution to mx + c = a is the y intercept of y = mx +c,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that solving the equation mx + c = a for x gives the y-intercept of the linear equation y = mx + c. They may incorrectly assume that the solution to the equation mx + c = a is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which is actually the value of c in the equation y = mx + c.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When solving linear equations and interpreting the results graphically.
- When finding the x-intercept of a linear equation and mistakenly taking it as the y-intercept.
- When comparing the solutions of linear equations in the form mx + c = a with the graph of the equation y = mx + c.
- When determining the y-intercept of a linear equation from a given solution to the equation mx + c = a, without realizing that the y-intercept is actually the value of c.
- When graphing linear equations and incorrectly labeling the x-intercept as the y-intercept."
2574,Believes that when multiplying by a power of 10 you add zeroes after the decimal point,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of multiplying numbers by powers of 10, but misunderstand the process. They may think that when multiplying a decimal number by a power of 10, they simply add zeroes after the decimal point, without considering the actual effect of the multiplication on the decimal point's position.

For example, if a student is asked to multiply 5.6 by 10, they may incorrectly add a zero after the decimal point, resulting in 5.60, instead of the correct answer, 56. Similarly, if asked to multiply 3.4 by 100, they may incorrectly add two zeroes after the decimal point, resulting in 3.400, instead of the correct answer, 340.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

* Multiplying 2.5 by 10, resulting in 2.50 instead of 25
* Multiplying 1.8 by 100, resulting in 1.800 instead of 180
* Multiplying 4.2 by 1000, resulting in 4.2000 instead of 4200"
2575,Thinks adding same amount to each side of a ratio gives an equivalent ratio,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that adding the same amount to each side of a ratio will result in an equivalent ratio. They may think that if they start with a ratio of 2:3, adding 2 to both sides will give them an equivalent ratio of 4:5. This misconception stems from a misunderstanding of the concept of ratios and proportions. Students may be incorrectly applying the concept of adding the same amount to both sides of an equation to solve for a variable, and mistakenly applying it to ratios.

This misconception can occur in various scenarios, such as:

- When simplifying ratios: A student may think that adding the same amount to both sides of a ratio will simplify it, resulting in an equivalent ratio.
- When scaling ratios up or down: Students may believe that adding the same amount to both sides of a ratio will result in an equivalent ratio, even if the scale factor is not proportional.
- When solving proportion problems: Students may incorrectly add the same amount to both sides of a proportion, resulting in an incorrect solution.
- When working with equivalent ratios in real-world applications, such as cooking recipes or building design."
2576,Mixes up square numbers and cube numbers,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students struggle to differentiate between the concept of square numbers and cube numbers. Square numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself (e.g., 2 × 2 = 4), whereas cube numbers are the result of multiplying a number by itself twice (e.g., 2 × 2 × 2 = 8). Students with this misconception may incorrectly identify or calculate square or cube numbers, leading to errors in their mathematical work.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to identify whether a number is a square or cube number, a student with this misconception might incorrectly classify it. For example, they might say that 9 is a cube number (instead of a square number, since 3 × 3 = 9).

2. When solving mathematical problems involving square or cube roots, students may apply the wrong operation. For instance, they might try to find the square root of a number that is actually a cube number, or vice versa.

3. In algebra, students may mistakenly apply the rules for square numbers to cube numbers, or vice versa, leading to incorrect simplifications or solutions.

4. In geometry, students might incorrectly calculate the area or volume of shapes, such as squares, cubes, or other 3D shapes, due to their misunderstanding of square and cube numbers.

5. In word problems, students may misinterpret the context and apply the wrong operation (squaring or cubing) to solve the problem, leading to incorrect answers."
2577,Does not think a square root can be negative,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the concept of square roots, but they are not fully aware of the properties and characteristics of square roots, particularly with regards to negative numbers. They may believe that the square root of a number is always positive because they have only been exposed to positive square roots or because they think that the square of a negative number cannot be positive. This misconception can be further reinforced by the fact that many calculators only give the positive square root of a number.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When simplifying expressions with square roots, such as √16, students may only give the positive answer, 4, and not consider the negative answer, -4.
- When solving quadratic equations, such as x^2 = 4, students may only give the positive solution, x = 2, and not consider the negative solution, x = -2.
- When working with functions that involve square roots, such as f(x) = √x, students may not consider the possibility of negative outputs, even if the input is a positive number."
2578,"Mixes up sides of a ratio, when working with vectors for line segments.","Explanation: This misconception occurs when students confuse the order of the components in a ratio, particularly when working with vectors that represent line segments. In the context of vectors, the order of the components is crucial, as it determines the direction of the vector. When students mix up the sides of a ratio, they may inadvertently change the direction of the vector, leading to incorrect calculations and conclusions.

This misconception can manifest in various ways, such as:

* Swapping the x and y components of a vector when scaling or adding vectors.
* Reversing the order of the components when finding the ratio of two vectors.
* Incorrectly labeling the components of a vector, leading to confusion about the direction of the vector.

Some short cases when this misconception will occur include:

* When finding the midpoint of a line segment using vectors, a student may mix up the x and y components, resulting in an incorrect midpoint.
* When scaling a vector by a factor, a student may swap the x and y components, changing the direction of the vector.
* When adding two vectors, a student may confuse the order of the components, resulting in an incorrect sum."
2579,Forgets to add the numerator when converting from a mixed number to an improper fraction ,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are converting a mixed number (a combination of a whole number and a fraction) to an improper fraction (a fraction where the numerator is greater than the denominator). The student will correctly multiply the whole number by the denominator and write it as the new numerator, but they will forget to add the original numerator to this product, resulting in an incomplete conversion.

For example, this misconception may occur in the following cases:

- When converting 2 3/4 to an improper fraction, a student may multiply 2 by 4 to get 8, but forget to add 3, writing the improper fraction as 8/4 instead of 11/4.
- When converting 5 2/3 to an improper fraction, a student may multiply 5 by 3 to get 15, but forget to add 2, writing the improper fraction as 15/3 instead of 17/3.
- When converting 3 1/2 to an improper fraction, a student may multiply 3 by 2 to get 6, but forget to add 1, writing the improper fraction as 6/2 instead of 7/2."
2580,Believes degrees can be used to measure length,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students confuse the concept of degrees, which is a unit of measurement for angles, with units of measurement for length, such as meters or centimeters. They may think that degrees can be used to measure the length of a line or the distance between two points. This misconception can lead to incorrect calculations and misunderstandings in various areas of mathematics, particularly in geometry and trigonometry.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

1. When asked to measure the length of a line segment, a student might respond with an answer in degrees, such as ""The line is 90 degrees long.""
2. When solving problems involving perimeter or circumference, a student might attempt to add or multiply degrees to find the length of a shape.
3. When working with trigonometry, a student might confuse the angle measurement in degrees with the length of the adjacent or opposite side of a triangle.
4. When asked to convert between units, a student might try to convert degrees to meters or centimeters, or vice versa.
5. When solving real-world problems, such as measuring the distance between two points on a map, a student might use degrees as a unit of length, leading to incorrect calculations."
2581,"When factorising a quadratic with a coefficient of x squared, believes the signs and/or positions of the constants are interchangeable","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are factorising quadratics in the form of ax^2 + bx + c and they incorrectly believe that the signs and/or positions of the constants can be swapped without affecting the factorisation. They may think that as long as the numbers are the same, the signs and positions do not matter.

For example, when factorising x^2 + 5x + 6, students may incorrectly think that (x + 2)(x + 3) is the same as (x + 3)(x + 2), (x - 2)(x - 3), or even (x + 2)(x - 3), not realising that the signs and positions of the constants are crucial in obtaining the correct factorisation.

This misconception may occur in the following cases:

- Factorising quadratics with two positive constants, e.g. x^2 + 5x + 6
- Factorising quadratics with two negative constants, e.g. x^2 - 7x + 12
- Factorising quadratics with one positive and one negative constant, e.g. x^2 + 2x - 15
- When the quadratic has a coefficient of x squared that is not 1, e.g. 2x^2 + 5x + 3."
2582,"When multiplying numbers with the same base, multiplies the powers ","Explanation: This misconception arises when students are introduced to the rule of multiplying numbers with the same base, but misunderstand its application to exponents. They incorrectly believe that when multiplying numbers with the same base, they need to multiply the powers (exponents) as well, instead of adding them. For instance, when given the expression 2^3 * 2^4, they might calculate it as 2^(3*4) = 2^12, rather than adding the exponents as 2^(3+4) = 2^7.

This misconception will occur in cases such as:

- Multiplying numbers with the same base in algebraic expressions: 3^2 * 3^5
- Simplifying exponential expressions: (2^3)^4 * 2^2
- Solving problems involving exponential growth or decay: A population doubles every 2 years, if there are 100 people initially and the population doubles 3 times, how many people will there be after 6 years?"
2583,Does not know what a cube number is,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students are unfamiliar with or have a limited understanding of the concept of cube numbers. A cube number, also known as a perfect cube, is a number that can be expressed as the product of three equal integers, or in other words, it is the result of multiplying a number by itself three times. Students with this misconception may struggle to identify or generate cube numbers, and may not recognize the relationship between cube numbers and their corresponding cube roots.

This misconception can occur in the following cases:

- When students are asked to identify or list examples of cube numbers, they may provide incorrect answers or fail to recognize cube numbers such as 1 (1^3), 8 (2^3), or 27 (3^3).
- When students are given a number and asked to determine if it is a cube number, they may not know how to check or verify this.
- When students are asked to solve problems involving cube roots, such as finding the cube root of a given number, they may struggle to understand the relationship between cube numbers and their corresponding cube roots.
- When students are working with geometric shapes, such as cubes, and need to calculate volumes or other properties that involve cube numbers, their lack of understanding of cube numbers can lead to errors or confusion."
2584,Believes that any percentage of a larger number will be greater than any percentage of a smaller number,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students fail to consider the relationship between the percentage and the actual value of the numbers being compared. They assume that since a larger number is involved, any percentage of it will automatically be greater than a percentage of a smaller number. However, this is not always the case, as the actual value of the percentage also depends on the specific percentage being taken, not just the size of the original number.

Short cases when the misconception will occur:

- Case 1: Comparing 10% of 100 to 90% of 10. Students with this misconception might assume that 10% of 100 is greater than 90% of 10 without calculating the actual values.
- Case 2: Evaluating discounts on different priced items, such as a 20% discount on a $100 item versus a 50% discount on a $20 item. Students may incorrectly assume the discount on the $100 item is greater without considering the actual amount of the discount.
- Case 3: Analyzing interest rates on savings accounts, where students might mistakenly believe that a higher interest rate on a smaller principal amount will always result in more interest earned than a lower interest rate on a larger principal amount."
2585,Believes a cubic expression should have three terms,"Explanation: This misconception arises when students mistakenly believe that the term ""cubic"" refers to the number of terms in an expression, rather than the highest power of the variable. They may think that a cubic expression must have three terms, similar to how a quadratic expression typically has three terms (e.g., ax^2 + bx + c). However, a cubic expression is actually defined by the presence of a term with a variable raised to the power of three (e.g., x^3), regardless of the number of terms.

This misconception can lead students to incorrectly identify or construct cubic expressions. For example, they might:

- Believe that the expression x^3 + 2x is not cubic because it only has two terms.
- Think that the expression x^2 + 2x + 3 is cubic because it has three terms, despite the variable not being raised to the power of three.
- Struggle to recognize cubic expressions with more or fewer than three terms, such as x^3 - 2 or x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 1.
- Incorrectly simplify or expand cubic expressions to try to fit them into a three-term mold."
2586,Misunderstands order of operations in algebraic expressions,"Explanation: This misconception occurs when students are unclear about the correct order in which to perform mathematical operations when presented with an algebraic expression containing multiple operations. The order of operations typically includes parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division, and addition and subtraction. However, some students might perform the operations from left to right or randomly, which can lead to incorrect solutions.

Some short cases when the misconception will occur:

- When an expression has both addition and multiplication (e.g., 2 + 3 * 4), a student with this misconception might perform the addition first and then the multiplication.
- When an expression has parentheses but the student ignores them or calculates the operations outside the parentheses first (e.g., 2 + (3 * 4) might be calculated as 2 + 3 and then multiplied by 4).
- When an expression involves multiple exponents and other operations (e.g., 2^2 * 3 + 4), a student with this misconception might calculate the exponents last or after other operations.
- When an expression involves a mix of multiplication and division operations (e.g., 12 ÷ 3 * 2), a student with this misconception might perform the operations from left to right without considering the order of operations.
- When an expression has a combination of negative numbers and operations (e.g., -2 + 3 * (-4)), a student with this misconception might incorrectly handle the negative signs and operations."
